2,Yellow Skin (Jaundice) in Cats," of Jaundice in Cats 
Jaundice in cats is, by definition, yellowing of the skin. It’s most easily seen when looking at the whites of your cat’s eyes, the lightly haired area inside of the ears, or along the lips and back of the hard palate (roof) in the mouth. Most cats experiencing jaundice are also not feeling well, so they may be sluggish, not eating as much, and vomiting frequently. 

The following additional signs may appear with jaundice: 


        
        Yellowish discoloration of the skin 
        



        
        Fever 
        
        
        Abdominal pain 
        
        
        Loss of appetite (anorexia) 
        
        
        Paleness 
        
        
        Change in color of urine and feces (orange colored) 
        



        
        Increased frequency (polyuria) and volume of urine 
        
        
        Increased thirst (polydipsia) and consumption of water 
        
        
        Mental confusion in advanced cases

3,Yeast Infection and Thrush in Cats,"



How the symptoms of candidiasis manifest depend largely on where the infection takes place. In the case of an ear infection, a common symptom is constant shaking and scratching at the head. If candida settles in the oral cavity, there will usually be an abnormal amount of drooling. If it involves the urinary bladder, your cat may experience inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). Inflammation around areas where intravenous (IV) catheters and gastronomy tubes have been inserted, skin irritation, open sores on the skin (ulcerative lesions), and correlating fever are common symptoms that these sites have been invaded by candida.

        Kidney disease
    
    


"
5,Worms in Cats," of Worms in Cats
Symptoms of worms in cats may vary. You can usually determine the type of worm based on your cat’s symptoms:


        
        Diarrhea or soft stool; you may see worms in the stool
        
        
        Vomiting (worms may be seen in the vomit)

"
7,Whipworms in Cats," of Whipworm Infection in Cats
Fortunately, most infections are mild in cats, and in many cases a cat will not show any symptoms. A few worms generally don’t cause significant problems. Health concerns arise when a cat is heavily infected. In these rare cases, cats can experience extreme illness or possibly die from the infection.

Symptoms of severe infection include:


	Bloody diarrhea, with or without mucus
	Weight loss
	Dehydration
	General malaise
	Anemia (low red blood cell count)


Whipworms live in the cecum and large intestine, so they are rarely seen by the naked eye. Eggs are microscopic.

"
11,Water Mold Infection (Pythiosis) in Cats," and Types

Pythiosis of the lungs, brain, or sinus will manifest in the cat as stuffiness, head pain, fever, coughing, and swelling of the sinuses. Infection of the cat's digestive tract leads to a chronic disease, which causes the tissue of the stomach and/or intestines to become severely thick. Other symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) pythiosis include:


    Fever
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Regurgitation
    Long-term 	weight loss
    Abdominal 	mass
    Abdominal 	pain
    Enlarged 	lymph nodes


Pythiosis of the skin (or cutaneous pythiosis) results in the development of swollen, non-healing wounds, and invasive masses of ulcerated pus-filled nodules and draining tracts. Tissue death (necrosis) follows, with the affected skin eventually turning black and wasting.

"
12,Wart Virus in Cats," and Types

 

Symptoms related to this disorder include bad breath associated with oral papillomatosis, bleeding from the mouth, increased or decreased appetite, and excessive excretion of saliva.

"
25,Uveitis in Cats," of Uveitis in Cats
Eye conditions in cats tend to be sneaky, and uveitis is no different. That’s because cats are good at hiding their illnesses and may simply hide more when they aren’t feeling their best or are in pain.

Cat uveitis can have an acute or sudden onset, or it can develop slowly and remain undetected for some time.

Because uveitis can cause blindness, the only thing you may notice is your cat’s sudden disappearance, as this condition would certainly be alarming to them and cause them to retreat.

If you do notice physical signs, either one or both of your cat’s eyes can be affected. Most often, a notably “red eye” is seen. Your cat may squint, appear to be sensitive to light, and have a watery eye. This is because uveitis is painful.

The color of your cat’s iris may be altered or cloudy. Pupil size may be affected, along with your cat’s vision, though this can be harder to detect. If glaucoma (buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve) accompanies the uveitis, your cat’s eye may be enlarged or seem to stick out.

If a generalized infection or virus is involved in uveitis, your cat may act ill and show other clinical signs depending upon the particular issue.

Causes of Cat Uveitis
There are two general categories for causes of cat uveitis:


	
	Ocular, or having to do with the eye
	
	
	Systemic causes
	


Ocular Causes of Uveitis in Cats

Ocular causes include:


	
	Tears on the surface of the eye or within the cornea (the outermost cover of the eye), called corneal ulcers
	
	
	Trauma to the eye
	
	
	Cataracts (clouding of the eye lens)
	
	
	Tumors
	


Systemic "
26,UTIs in Cats (Urinary Tract Infections in Cats)," of Urinary Tract Infections in Cats
Most cats with urinary tract infections will make frequent trips to the litter box and seem restless. They may go into the box and strain to pee but produce either a small amount of urine or no urine at all. Occasionally, their urine may appear bloody.

Some cats will avoid the litter box because they have associated it with the discomfort caused by the UTI. Instead, they may urinate in other places in your home. Sinks, bathtubs, and clean laundry are popular spots. Your cat also may vomit and seem lethargic as the problem progresses—especially male cats.

In most cases, acute (sudden) and chronic urinary tract infections will cause very similar symptoms. However, some cats with the chronic form show no signs of disease.

"
27,Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats," of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
Symptoms of bladder cystals or stones in cats include:


	
	Small, frequent urinations
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	“Accidents” outside of the litter box—especially places like sinks or laundry
	
	
	Bloody urine
	


Signs your male cat may be experiencing a urinary emergency:


	
	Frequent trips to the litter box with little or no urine produced
	
	
	Straining with little to no urine produced
	
	
	Crying, restlessness
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Vomiting
	


While symptoms seen in bladder crystals and stones are similar, symptoms of bladder stones tend to go on longer than crystals.

"
28,Urinating Outside the Litter Box and Wandering Away from Home in Cats," and Types



Marking


	Cat urinates or defecates in a specific area that it has chosen
	Owner may not approve of the chosen area
	Urinating or defecating outside the litter box
	Urinating or defecating near doors or windows

	Can occur on vertical or upright surface, such as a wall or furniture (spraying)




Roaming


	Wandering away from home




"
29,Urinary Tract Stones/Crystals Made Up Of Uric Acid in Cats," and Types

While many cats will not show any signs of the disease, the most common symptoms usually deal with urination issues. These can include abnormal urine streams, difficulty urinating (dysuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), cloudy urine, and eventually the complete inability to urinate (anuria).

"
30,Urinary Tract / Kidney Stones (Cystine) in Cats," and Types

Typical symptoms can include pollakiuria, dysuria, and an abnormal flow of urine (post-renal uremia).

"
31,Urinary Tract / Kidney Stones (Calcium Phosphate) in Cats," and Types

The symptoms may vary depending on the location, size, and number of stones within the urinary tract. In fact, some cats display no outwardly visible signs of the issue; it is only discovered later during a routine checkup, if at all. The following are some typical symptoms associated with calcium phosphate urolithiasis:


    Increased urination (polyuria)
    Difficulty urinating (e.g., 	dribbling of urine)
    Pain when urinating
    Blood in urine


"
32,"Urinary Tract Infection, Lower (Bacterial) in Cats"," related to this type of infection include inflammation of the affected tissue and urinary difficulties.

 

Cats of all ages can be affected, but vulnerability increases with advancing age (common in cats 10 years or older). In such cases, stone formation, prostate disease, and tumors are frequently seen.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Difficulty urinating
	Blood in urine (hematuria)
	Cloudy or malodorous urine
	Frequent urination, but only in small amounts
	Urinary incontinence, especially during confinement or at places that are not customary (i.e., locations he has not peed before)
	Urination when bladder is touched (occasional)


 

"
33,Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats," of Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats 
Urinary tract blockages can have symptoms similar to other urinary conditions. Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a blanket term to describe urinary tract conditions in cats involving the urethra and bladder, including urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and inflammation (swelling). One common cause of FLUTD is feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). FIC is an inflammatory condition of the bladder that occurs secondary to stress.

FLUTD, FIC, and urethral obstruction can all result in similar clinical signs and make it difficult for the pet parent to determine which condition is affecting their cat. This determination is extremely important, because although FLUTD and FIC are typically not urgent, urethral obstruction can be fatal.

Common clinical signs noted with FLUTD, FIC, and the onset of urethral obstruction include:


	
	Bloody urine
	
	
	Urgency to urinate (more frequent trips to the litter box)
	
	
	Urinating smaller amounts more often
	
	
	Straining to urinate (which can sometimes be confused with straining to defecate)
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box (often in strange places such as a bathtub, sink, or tile floor)
	
	
	Licking the genital area
	
	
	Vocalization (meowing loudly and often) as if in pain or distress
	
	
	Lethargy/increased hiding
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting/diarrhea
	


The defining sign of your cat having a urethral obstruction is straining to urinate with no urine production or only a few drops of urine produced. It can be hard to tell, especially if your pet has been going to the litter box frequently or urinating outside the litter box in the house. Placing your cat in a small bathroom with a litter box for a few hours to check for any urine production may be the best way to determine if they are urinating.

If you are unsure your cat is producing urine, consider this an emergency, and have them evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Life-threatening consequences can occur in as little as 12-24 hours of being unable to urinate. Death from untreated obstruction may occur in as little as 36-48 hours.

"
34,Urinary Incontinence in Cats," of Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Urinary incontinence in cats can easily be confused with inappropriate urination (urination that occurs anywhere other than outdoors or in the litter box). Inappropriate urination is more common, but it is a voluntary (purposeful) action. Urinary incontinence will happen involuntarily, without the cat’s knowledge.


	
	Symptoms of involuntary leakage of urine (urinary incontinence) include:

	
		
		Not squatting or in position to urinate
		
	
	



	
	
		
		Cat unaware of urination
		
		
		Urine found in bed during sleep or rest
		
		
		Urine staining or smell near the urethral opening (under the tail). This can be seen as a skin infection.
		
	
	
	
	These symptoms can be seen in both urinary incontinence and inappropriate urination:

	
		
		Chronic urinary tract infection
		
		
		Hematuria (blood in urine)
		
		
		Excessive grooming in urethral area
		
	
	
	
	Symptoms of inappropriate urination that are not seen with urinary incontinence include:

	
		
		Posturing to urinate
		
		
		Straining to urinate
		
		
		Pain during urination
		
		
		Reoccurring urination in certain areas of the house
		
		
		Urination on vertical surfaces (behavioral)

There are three categories of epulides: fibromatous, ossifying, and acanthomatous. Acanthomatous epuli, in particular, are highly invasive to the bone and  are usually located on the front part of the lower jaw. On occasion your cat will display no visible outward signs. It is therefore important you look inside your cat's mouth if you suspect a problem. Symptoms associated with epulides include:

56,Toxoplasmosis in Cats," are variable depending on which organs become affected.  

The oocysts that are passed in the feces are not infectious at first, but they become infectious after a period ranging from 1 to 5 days, when they undergo a process called sporulation. These oocysts can remain in the environment for many months.

This remarkable ability to survive in the environment is partly to blame for their success. Researchers estimate that about a third of the human population is infected with T. gondii, and the organism has been shown to infect animals like sea otters miles away from the site of the original cat defecation after rains washed the infected feces into the watershed. While concerning, do not fret too much, there are certain precautions you can take to minimize your risk as noted below.

58,Tooth Fracture in Cats,"

The most common complication involving a tooth fracture is inflammation and infection. In some instances, the tooth's crown may be missing; blood or pink tissue may also be present on or around the affected area. Otherwise, cats with root fractures display constant discomfort and pain.

"
59,Tooth Enamel Malformation in Cats," and Types


    Irregular, 	pitted enamel tooth surface with discoloration of diseased enamel 	and potential exposure of underlying dentin (light brown appearance)
    Early 	or rapid accumulation of plaque and calculus on roughened tooth surface
    Possible 	gingivitis and/or accelerated 	periodontal/gum disease


"
60,Tooth Dislocation or Sudden Loss in Cats," and Types



In cases of intrusion, the affected tooth will appear shorter than normal. In cases with extrusion, the tooth appears longer than normal and can be moved both vertically and horizontally when touched. In cases of lateral luxation, the upper part of the tooth is found deviated on the either side, taking on a crooked appearance. It may be overlapping a nearby tooth to some degree. In cases where there is avulsion of the tooth, the tooth is found to have become completely displaced from its bony socket. This is most often as the result of an injury to the mouth, or to an infection at or near the tooth.



"
61,Too Much Acid in the Body in Cats," and Types

The symptoms may vary considerably, especially if your cat is concurrently compromised by other health problems like diabetes or kidney disease. The most common symptoms that you may notice in a cat that is suffering from metabolic acidosis include:

"
65,Ticks and Tick Control in Cats,"



Ticks may be visibly present on the cat's body, especially as they (the ticks) grow. Ticks have a hard backed shield and can be felt as small bumps during a palpation of the skin, or during regular petting. There may also be other symptoms present if a tick borne disease develops.



"
66,Tick Paralysis in Cats," of Tick Paralysis in Cats
Neurotoxins secreted in the saliva of affected ticks, then transferred to a cat’s bloodstream through a bite, cause rapidly progressing neurologic signs that start with weakness in the cat’s hind limbs and ascend to cause weakness in the forelimbs. Paralysis of all four legs can follow.

Less commonly, cranial nerves may become involved. This causes trouble swallowing and change in voice/meow.

In even more serious cases, respiratory distress can develop due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, possibly causing respiratory failure. Signs associated with this disease will progress rapidly if the tick is not removed promptly.

"
67,Thyroid Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats," and Types

Following are some of the symptoms commonly related to adenocarcinoma of the thyroid.


    Large fixed or movable mass over 	cat’s trachea covering the larynx

"
69,Thickening of the Uterine Lining and Fluid Filled Sac in Cats," of Pyometra in Cats
The symptoms of pyometra can vary from subtle (almost unnoticeable) to severe lethargy, vomiting and weakness. Symptoms vary greatly because of a female cat’s opening from the vagina to the uterus called the cervix. This part of the body opens, or dilates, during labor and delivery, as well as during heat. It then closes following heat (or after a cat gives birth). If the cervix is still open, when pyometra develops, the pus can drain out of the body. Cats with an open cervix, or “open pyometra,” are much less sick than those with a closed cervix, “closed pyometra.”  

When the cervix is closed, it traps the pus inside the uterus which can result in the pet becoming septic and toxic shock developing quickly.  

Common signs of pyometra include:  


	
	Pus draining from the vulva: This can be difficult to spot because cats are very meticulous about grooming. Watch for any drainage around the base of the tail or on bedding.  
	
	
	Lethargy, depression, or weakness 
	
	
	Anorexia or decreased appetite 
	
	
	Increased thirst 
	



	
	Vomit or diarrhea 
	
	
	Fever

"
72,Testicular Tumor (Seminoma) in Cats," and Types

Although seminomas rarely causes any clinical symptoms in the animal, some cats exhibit pain due to pressure from the growing tumor. In a few cases, the testicular mass can be palpapated. Even rarer still, some tumors can become malignant and metastasize to other parts of the body.

"
73,Testicular Tumor (Leydig Cell) in Cats," and Types


    One 	or more round masses (1-2 cm in diameter) in a testicle
    There 	are generally no symptoms with this type of tumor, unless it is 	actually a Sertoli cell tumor (cells which help nourish spermatids 	as they transform into spermatozoa in the testicles)
    Signs 	of a Sertoli cell tumor:
    
        Feminization 		(from secretion of estrogen)
        Bone 		marrow underdevelopment
    
    


"
74,Testicular Swelling in Cats," and Types

The symptoms of epididymitis and orchitis can be localized in the area of the scrotum. These include:


    Swollen testicles
    Licking of the scrotum and scrotal 	skin irritation (dermatitis)
    Non-localized symptoms include 	pain and fever
    Unwillingness to walk and general 	lethargy
    Open wound
    Refusal to eat
    In addition, infertility may be diagnosed in animals with this  condition


"
75,Temporomandibular Joint Disorders in Cats," and Types

    Pain when chewing food
    Vocalizing, mewing while trying to eat
    Loss of appetite


"
76,Teeth Misalignment in Cats," and Types of Malocclusion of Teeth



Common problems that can arise from tooth malocclusion:




	Mouth injuries
	Periodontal disease
	Soft-tissue defects from tooth contact in the floor of the mouth and the roof of the mouth (palate)
	Wear on the teeth
	Fractures




If problems with the palate persist, a fistula may result and become infected. In cases of misaligned teeth, the cat may have difficulty chewing, picking up food, and may be inclined to eat only larger pieces. They are also prone to tartar and plaque build-up.



There are several types of diagnosable malocclusion:




	Overbite (sometimes called overshot, Class 2, overjet, or mandibular brachygnathism)
	Underbite (also called undershot, reverse scissor bite, prognathism, and Class 3)
	Level bite (sometimes called even bite)
	Open bite (front teeth don’t meet each other when mouth is closed)
	Anterior crossbite (canine and premolars occlude normally but one or more lower incisors are in front of the upper incisors)
	Posterior crossbite (one or more premolar teeth overlap the upper teeth)
	Wry mouth or bite (one side of jaw grows longer than the other)
	Base narrow canines (lower teeth protrude inward and can harm the upper palate)




With an overbite, the upper jaw is longer than the lower one. When the mouth is closed, a gap between the upper and lower incisors occurs. Kittens born with an overbite will sometimes have the problem correct itself if the gap is not too large. However, a cat's bite will usually set at ten months old. At this time improvement will not happen on its own. Your pet's overbite may worsen as the permanent teeth come in because they are larger and can damage the soft parts of the mouth. Teeth extractions are sometimes necessary.



"
77,Tear in the Heart in Cats," and Types


    Sudden weakness
    Fainting
    Sudden death
    Rapid heart rate
    Ascites (abnormal collection of fluid in the abdomen)

"
78,Taurine Deficiency in Cats," of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Symptoms usually develop only after months of not eating enough taurine, but typically include the following:


	
	Eye damage with lesions that can lead to blindness—You may first notice your cat bumping into objects, seeming disoriented, having difficulty finding food/water bowls and toys, and showing reluctance to enter dark rooms or go up and down stairs. You may even see a greater sheen (reflectiveness) in their eyes.
	
	
	Impaired reproduction—This may result in spontaneous abortion, infertility, low birth weights, and birth defects. Affected kittens may have stunted growth and development.
	
	
	Heart dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)—This can lead to eventual heart failure. Pet parents may see their cat having difficulty breathing, pale or blue gums, a weak pulse, generalized weakness, collapse, and even death.
	
	
	Deafness
	
	
	Immune deficiency, which may show as recurrent infections
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Exercise intolerance
	
	
	Muscle atrophy
	


"
79,Tapeworms in Cats," of Tapeworms in Cats
Proglottids are the egg-containing segments of a tapeworm’s body. When they first come out of your cat’s anus, they look like pieces of white rice, and they may wiggle for a while. Sometimes several tapeworm segments will be stuck together end-to-end. As they dry out, they become harder and more yellow than white.

Other than the presence of proglottids, most cats with tapeworms don’t have many other symptoms.

However, some possible symptoms of tapeworms in cats include:


	
	Scooting
	
	
	Licking at the hind end
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Vomiting
	


In rare cases, intestinal blockage and signs of systemic disease such as a poor appetite, low energy, and weight loss can occur.

"
80,Systemic Autoimmune Disease in Cats," and Types



Clinical symptoms depend on the localization of the immune complexes, along with the specificity of the autoantibodies. However, genetic, environmental, pharmacologic, and infectious factors may play a role in the appearance of clinical signs such as letahrgy, loss of appetite (anorexia), and fever, which is especially seen in the acute phase. Other signs include:



Musculoskeletal


	Deposition of immune complexes in the synovial membranes (the soft tissue lining the surfaces within the joints)
	Swollen and/or painful joints - major presenting sign in most patients
	Shifting-leg lameness
	Muscle pain or wasting




Skin/exocrine 


	Deposition of immune complexes in the skin
	Skin lesions
	Symmetric or focal skin lesions - redness, scaling, ulcers, depigmentation, and/or hair loss
	Ulceration of mucocutaneous junctions and oral mucosa may develop - a region of skin comprising both mucosa and cutaneous skin; these mostly occur near the orifices of the body at which the external skin stops and the mucosa that covers the inside of the body starts (e.g., mouth, anus, nostrils)




Renal/urologic 


	Deposition of immune complexes in the kidney
	Hepatosplenomegaly - enlargement of the kidney and the liver




Blood/lymph/immune system 


	Autoantibodies against erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets (red and white blood cells)
	Lymphadenopathy - swollen lymph nodes
	Other organ systems may be affected if there is deposition of immune complexes or antibodies, or when T cell-mediated cells (lymphocytes) attack




"
81,Synechiae in Cats," and Types

Synechiae may be anterior or posterior.


    Anterior synechiae is      defined as an adhesion between the iris and the cornea. The cornea is the      transparent cover of the front of the eye.
    Posterior synechiae is      the adherence of the iris to the capsule surrounding the lens of the eye.


Symptoms seen with synechiae include:


    Squinting
    Corneal lesions, such      as ulcers
    Excessive tearing
    Glaucoma
    Variation in the color      of the iris
    Opacity of the lens
    Uveitis
    Decreased papillary      reaction to light


"
82,Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats," of Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats
Clinical signs of a salivary mucocele vary, depending on which glands are affected and the extent of  damage. Often the first sign is a soft, nonpainful, slow-growing swelling on the neck, with or without excessive drooling. The swelling can be noticed on the side of the face as well, but often the saliva pools downward and the swelling is first noticed on the neck.

When the salivary glands under the tongue are affected, you may notice your cat is having trouble eating, chewing, or swallowing. Sometimes the swelling under the tongue is not noticed until your cat accidentally injures the area (usually when eating) and it begins to bleed.

When the salivary glands closer to the throat are damaged, this can be much more serious, causing difficulty breathing.

The least common salivary gland to be affected is under the eye, which can cause a swelling similar to that from an infected tooth root. A salivary mucocele is generally nonpainful, but the gland can become infected, causing pain and even a fever.

A tumor can also cause the swelling to be painful, and often it is harder in texture than a mucocele alone. You may notice your cat dropping food while eating, not eating as much, or not eating at all.  When cats get a mucocele on the neck or the lower jaw, there are often no signs other than the visible swelling.

"
83,Swelling of the Optic Disk in the Retina of Cats," and Types
 
Depending on whether the nerves in both eyes have been affected, it may be difficult to observe symptoms. If both nerves are inflamed then signs of blindness will normally be present.
 
Symptoms will include bumping into things; getting lost within the normal habitat; a fearful attitude; and being incapable of catching toys or finding objects. Aggressive behavior may also be present. If the disease has affected the cat's brain, neurological indicators will be present. However, if the disease is systemic in nature, the cat may display signs of weakness, anorexia and lethargy.
 
"
84,Swallowing Difficulties in Cats," and Types



Oral dysphagia can be caused by dental disease, tongue paralysis, paralysis of the jaw, swelling or wasting away of the chewing muscles, or by an inability to open the mouth. Cats with oral dysphagia often eat in an altered way, such as tilting the head to one side or throwing the head backward while eating. Food packed in the cheek folds of the mouth without saliva are also typical signs of oral dysphagia.



Pharyngeal dysphagia is when the cat can grab food, but must repeatedly attempt to swallow while flexing and extending the head and neck, chewing excessively and gagging. While food is retained in the cheek folds of the mouth, it is saliva-coated. There is a diminished gag reflex and there may be snotty discharge from the nose.



With cricopharyngeal dysphagia, the cat may succeed at swallowing after several attempts, but afterward it gags, coughs and forcibly throws its food back up. Unlike pharyngeal dysphagia, the gag reflex is normal. Animals suffering from cricopharyngeal dysphagia are often very thin.



"
85,Stupor and Coma in Cats," and Types
 
The symptoms are highly variable depending on the primary disease that has led to the loss of consciousness, whether it is temporary, as with stupor, or long lasting, as with coma.

The major symptom is varying levels of unconsciousness, with the degree of consciousness depending on the nature and severity of the underlying disease.

"
86,Stud Tail in Cats," and Types




	Greasy (sometimes matted) hair at the base of the tail
	Missing hair at the base of the tail
	Blackheads (comedones) on the skin at the base of the tail
	Waxy substance on the skin and hair at the base of the tail
	Skin infection at the base of the tail
	A foul odor




"
87,"Stretchy, Saggy, Painful Skin in Cats"," and Types

Symptoms of cutaneous asthenia generally include saggy skin, with redundant folds of skin. The skin is soft, delicate, and thin, with insufficient elasticity. The skin is easily torn, often leaving wide “fish mouth” type wounds that bleed very little, but that leave scars which widen over time. There may also be scars on the skin that are unaccounted for. Your cat may have swelling under the skin of the elbows, due to the bones putting pressure on the skin when the cat is at rest, and bruising and bleeding under the skin (hematoma) of the elbows, and throughout the body. Lacerations on the back and head are also common. Collagen is low internally as well as externally, making it possible for internal structures to rupture, with resultant internal bleeding.

For cats, symptoms will often show at about eight weeks of age. Normal play with litter mates will leave large tears in the skin, which heal quickly but leave lasting scars. Hernias have also been reported in cats affected with cutaneous asthenia.

This condition tends to affect the following breeds:


    Domestic 	shorthairs
    Domestic 	longhairs
    Himalayans


"
88,Stomatitis in Cats," of Stomatitis in Cats
The first symptom of feline stomatitis you may notice is a foul odor coming from your cat’s mouth. This may be accompanied by excessive salivation/drooling, or you may notice that your cat is not grooming themselves as much.  

You might also see your cat dropping food from their mouth or crying out while eating. Some cats become so painful they become hesitant to eat and may avoid food to the point that they start losing weight.

"
89,Stomach Worm Infection (Physalopterosis) in Cats," and Types



An infection of stomach worms caused by Physaloptera spp. can be asymptomatic, meaning that no obvious outward symptoms are present, or the infection may be apparent by the presence of gastric symptoms.

"
97,"Stained, Discolored Teeth in Cats"," and Types

Intrinsic discoloration is characterized by secondary factors that are happening inside the tooth, discoloring the underlying dentin. Extrinsic discoloration, meanwhile, occurs when exogenous pigment accumulates on the surface of teeth. That is, the cause of the discoloration is from an external source, rather than from a physical condition. Common symptoms associated with both discoloration types include:


    Abnormal 	coloration of one or more teeth
    Fractured 	tooth
    Pitted 	enamel (the glossy covering of the tooth) with staining
    Rings 	or lines of discoloration around one or more teeth

107,Sperm Abnormalities in Cats,"
 
Spermatozoal abnormalities are sometimes classified into primary and secondary defects. Primary defects occur during spermatogenesis, the development stage, and secondary defects occur during transport and storage within the epididymis (part of the spermatic duct system). Often there are no outward symptoms of this disorder. The most obvious symptom makes itself apparent in the breeding cat, when the male cat fails to impregnate a breeding partner.

Skin ulcers appear as round, open sores in the skin. The outer border of the ulcer might look raised and thick and as an ulcer forms there may be some discoloration of the skin that eventually will start to turn red and feel warm to the touch.

Skin ulcers often leak a clear or pink-tinged fluid, called serum. The serum can dry into a crust on the surface of the ulcer, which may appear as a scab from dried blood or pus. An infected ulcer can crack and open producing thick, white pus.

Skin ulcers are painful to cats, which may cause them to display other systemic signs such as:


	
	Decreased appetite

"
121,Skin Fungal Infections in Cats," of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Fungal infections may be superficial, causing hair loss, redness, scaling, crusting, increased pigmentation, and pustules (bulging patch of skin). Infected hair follicles may be removed easily, but more severe fungal infections create under the skin nodules, draining tracts, and abscesses. Secondary bacterial infections are also common.

Many fungal infections are capable of invading the body causing a systemic disease that most commonly affects the lungs and the nervous system. Non-dermatologic clinical signs include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Breathing difficulty
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Blindness
	
	
	Seizures
	


Causes of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungus is found commonly in the environment. The pathogenic, or disease-causing species, are usually found in soil, but can be spread through contaminated materials and other animals. Cats can get fungal infections through direct exposure, typically through the skin with a broken barrier, as well as breathing in or ingesting spores.

Fungi are opportunistic and take advantage of a host’s weakened immune system, wounds, and concurrent infections. Bacterial infections and fungal infections are often diagnosed together, although it can be difficult to figure out which came first.

While indoor cats can get fungal infections, outdoor, roaming cats have a higher exposure to fungal elements. Some cats may be asymptomatic carriers and show no symptoms, yet they can spread the disease to other animals and humans.

Longhaired cat breeds such as Persians and Himalayans may have a predisposition to skin fungal infections.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Based on lifestyle and clinical signs of hair loss, crusting, and scaling, veterinarians may suspect a fungal skin infection. They may use a variety of tests to diagnose fungal infections as well as other common diseases (such as bacterial or parasitic infections) that show up similarly.


	
	Deep skin scrapes and cytology: While fungal structures are not commonly found during this process, skin scrapes and cytology are used to diagnose concurrent bacterial infections and mite infestations. Yeast infections also are commonly diagnosed with cytology.
	
	
	Wood’s lamp examination: Some types of fungal species will fluoresce bright green under this lamp, most commonly M. canis. However, it is possible to have false positives and false negatives, so the Wood’s lamp should only be used as a screening tool.
	
	
	Trichogram: In this test, a hair follicle and scale from the edge of a lesion is evaluated under a microscope for evidence of fungal structures.
	
	
	Dermatophyte culture: This is the gold standard of testing and involves taking samples of skin lesions and allowing them to develop on a growth medium for two to three weeks. Any growth is recorded and analyzed for species identification.
	
	
	Biopsy: Biopsy (removal of tissue for examination) may be best used in non-healing wounds and masses that are surgically removed.
	
	
	PCR: Some laboratories can run these tests to identify fungal DNA.
	


Treatment of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Surgical removal of nodules, draining tracts, and abscesses may be the preferred treatment method in some types of infection. All surgical lesions should be biopsied for a definitive diagnosis.

All concurrent illnesses—such as bacterial infections, allergies, parasitic infestations, or diseases causing immunosuppression—should be tested and treated as necessary.

Skin lesions involving scales, crusts, and hair loss are most often treated with oral anti-fungal medications such as Itraconazole, Terbinafine, and Fluconazole. Not all antifungals are safe in cats, so it is important to only use medications prescribed by your veterinarian. These drugs are typically given long term (over months) and require treatment for three to four weeks after resolution. Clinical resolution involves not only the disappearance of clinical signs, but also two negative fungal cultures.

Other animals in the house may also be treated to prevent asymptomatic carrier status.

Recurrences are common, and cleaning contaminated materials within the house is crucial. Bedding should be washed daily and areas difficult to decontaminate (such as carpet) should be avoided. Pet parents may wish to discard non-washable items, such as cat trees or toys, as they may be a continuous source of re-infection.

Topical antifungal therapy, such as lime sulfur dip or shampoos containing miconazole, are effective at eliminating spores on the hair coat and decreasing the spread of disease. Topical therapy is typically recommended throughout the entire treatment process.

Recovery and Management of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Overall, the prognosis for skin fungal infections is good to excellent. Pet parents should expect multiple re-check exams with the veterinarian throughout treatment. Cats are not considered cured until clinical signs are resolved and they have two negative fungal cultures. After this, treatment should continue for another month.

149,Ringworm in Cats," of Ringworm in Cats
Symptoms of ringworm in cats include:


	
	Thickened patches of skin
	
	
	Circular areas of hair loss (may be patchy)
	
	
	Broken and stubby hair
	
	
	Scaly or crusty skin
	
	
	Changes in fur or skin color
	
	
	Inflamed areas of skin
	
	
	Excessive grooming and scratching
	
	
	Red or gray, scaly lesions (typically on the skin of a cat’s head, chest, front legs, and spine)
	
	
	Dull fur
	
	
	Dandruff
	
	
	Rough, scaly, hardening of the base of the nails
	
	
	Distortion of the nails
	
	
	Nail infections (rare)
	


In some more severe cases of ringworm in cats, the skin lesions are raised and nodular. These are called granulomas and may frequently produce discharge. 

Many cats, especially longhaired breeds, may have ringworm without any symptoms at all. These cats are called asymptomatic carriers.

Asymptomatic cats may still infect other pets or humans. It’s important to note that even though these cats don’t look sick, they may be highly contagious. 

"
150,Retained Testicle in Cats," and Types
 
This condition is rarely associated with pain or any other sign of disease. However, acute onset of abdominal pain generally indicates that the spermatic cord of the retained testes has become twisted, cutting off the blood supply to the testis. Many times, this testis will develop tumors, which is symptomized by feminine behavior.
 
"
151,Retained Deciduous Teeth in Cats," and Types
 

    Bad breath (halitosis)
    Abnormally-positioned permanent teeth
    Swollen, red, bleeding gums around baby teeth
    Local gingivitis and periodontal disease due to teeth overcrowding
    A permanent abnormal passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity (oronasal fistula)

    Systemic disease (in      some cases)


"
153,Reproductive Genetic Abnormalities in Cats," and Types

This condition is usually caused by disorders affecting the chromosomes that determine the traits of an animal's sexual function. Gonadal disorders affect the reproductive organs, and phenotypic disorders affect the physical and biochemical reproductive properties of the animal. The signs and symptoms of gonadal or reproductive sexual development disorders may include having an unusually large clitoris, for the female, or having an undescended testicle, for the male. Other unusual reproductive organ characteristics may also be present.

Signs and symptoms of chromosomal sexual development disorders may include defects in the number of sex chromosomes. In the process of genetically screening your cat, your veterinarian may find an abnormal number of X or Y chromosomes in your cat's genetic make-up.

Signs and symptoms of phenotypic sexual development disorders may include external reproductive organs that do not match the internal chromosomes. A cat that carries male chromosomes for example, may appear to have feminine external genitalia, or a smaller than normal penis. Some animals may possess a normal reproductive organ, but also have an additional, sometimes functional, very small second reproductive organ of the opposite gender.

"
154,Rectal Prolapse in Cats," of Rectal Prolapse in Cats
Cats with rectal prolapse will often act very uncomfortable and may not want to move around much. They may lick at their rectum and continue to posture and strain to poop, pee, or give birth, depending on the cause of the prolapse. 



The color of the exposed rectum is important. A recently prolapsed rectum will be dark pink but will quickly turn dark red as swelling and exposure progress. 



If the rectal prolapse is not treated quickly, the rectum may turn very dark red to black. Darker colors may be a sign of tissue death (e.g., necrosis). This is very serious and may result in long-term complications. The wall of the prolapsed rectum may also break (e.g., ulcerate) and swell.

 

"
155,Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats," of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
Common symptoms of rectal and anal inflammation in cats include:


	
	Diarrhea
	



	
	Frequent small, loose stools
	
	
	Straining to have bowel movements
	
	
	Increased urgency to go to the bathroom
	
	
	Accidents outside the litterbox
	
	
	Mucus or fresh blood on feces

	Prolapse of rectal tissue out the anal opening
	
	
	Licking of the anus
	


"
156,Rat Poisoning in Cats," shown by cats who consume rat poison, and veterinary treatment plans, differ depending on the type of bait ingested.

Types of Rodenticides

Anticoagulant rodenticides function by interfering with vitamin K recycling in the body, which ultimately leads to a bleeding condition called coagulopathy. There are multiple types of compounds in this category, which are further divided into first- and second-generation anticoagulants.

Bromethalin is a neurological toxin that causes brain swelling, loss of normal brain function, and death.

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) causes calcium to be held in the body and leads to high blood calcium and mineralization of tissues in the kidneys, lungs, heart, and blood vessels.

It is often difficult to figure out the amount of rat bait your cat has ingested. Therefore, consider ANY possible contact or ingestion of rodent bait by a cat toxic exposure, and seek veterinary attention immediately.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Rat Poisoning in Cats
Anticoagulant rodenticide: Clinical signs may not occur until several days or even weeks after ingestion. Signs may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Bruising (on the skin, gums, whites of the eyes)
	
	
	Black stool
	
	
	Vomiting up blood
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Swelling of the joints
	
	
	Blood in the urine
	


Bromethalin: Signs noted with toxicity depend on the amount your cat ingested. If a large amount, symptoms usually begin within a few hours. These may include muscle tremors, hyperthermia (high body temperature), seizures, or death.

If a small amount of bait is eaten, signs may not be noted for 1 to 4 days after ingestion. Usually, your cat will show signs of weakness and incoordination of the limbs, muscle tremors, paralysis, or cranial nerve abnormalities such as unequal pupil sizes or abnormal eye movements.

Vitamin D3: Clinical signs can be seen even at low exposure doses. A cat may become lethargic, start vomiting, drink more water than normal, have a higher volume of urine than normal, and have seizures. Death is possible.

"
157,Rapid Heart Rate in Cats," and Types
 

    Often      no clinical signs because condition is a compensatory response to a      variety of stresses
    If      associated with primary cardiac disease, weakness, exercise intolerance,      or loss of consciousness may be reported
    Pale      mucous membranes if associated with anemia or congestive heart failure
    Fever      may be present
    Signs      of congestive heart failure, such as shortness of breath, cough, and pale      mucous membranes may be present when ST is associated with primary cardiac      disease

 
"
158,Rapid Heart Rate in Cats," of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
Symptoms of rapid heart rate in cats include:


        
        Heart rate exceeding 180 beats per minute
        
        
        Panting
        
        
        Lethargy and weakness

        Loud vocalizations
        


"
159,Raccoon Disease in Cats," and Types

Two types of baylisascariasis have been reported in cats: intestinal infection and visceral disease. The development of the roundworm begins with ingestion of the roundworm eggs. They then migrate to the intestines, where they further develop before their final migration into the viscera (the organs that occupy the abdominal cavities), the nervous system, or the eye. These types of infections are referred to, respectively, as larval migrans; visceral larval migrans (VLM); neural larval migrans (NLM); and ocular larval migrans (OLM).

The intestinal form is most commonly found in adult cats, while infection of internal organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord (visceral disease) is more common in kittens. Often, there are not any outward symptoms associated with early onset of the disease, but occasionally cats will show signs of neurological disease due to the worm attacking the nervous system. Signs of neurological disease (NLM) include:


    Unsteady walking/loss of 	coordination or muscle control (ataxia)
    Difficulty eating/swallowing 	(dysphagia)
    Lethargy, lying down excessively (recumbency)
    Circling
    Seizure
    Confusion, lack of attention


Infection of the viscera (VLM) may present symptoms of liver and/or lung disease, while infection of the eye (OLM) may not be apparent until your cat has lost the use of its vision.

"
160,Rabies in Cats," of Cat Rabies
Early symptoms of rabies may be gradual and hard to spot. During the first 2-4 days of infection, your cat may have a fever, less energy than usual, and decreased appetite. Symptoms tend to progress quickly to weakness or paralysis of the legs, seizures, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation (too much saliva) due to difficulty swallowing, and abnormal behavior. Changes in behavior can range from extreme aggression to extreme depression or coma. 

Classical rabies has two forms, paralytic and furious. Cats may show signs of either or both. If the furious phase develops, cats can become aggressive and occasionally delusional. They may seem to hallucinate and attack their surroundings with no trigger. The paralytic phase may also occur, in which patients start to develop paralysis of various muscular systems, and often lose the ability to swallow. This leads to hypersalivation and foaming at the mouth—which some people consider to be a classical sign of rabies virus infection. 

Eventually, coma and death occur after paralysis or prolonged seizure activity. 

"
161,Q Fever in Cats," and Types

Lungs are thought to be the main portal of entry into systemic circulation. C. burnetii will then replicate in the organ's lining, causing widespread vasculitis. Inflammation of the cat's blood vessels will result in the death of its blood cells and hemorrhaging of the lungs, liver, and central nervous system.

Once the cat has contracted the disease it may display some of the following symptoms:


    Fever
    Lethargy
    Anorexia
    Depression
    Miscarriage
    Incoordination
    Seizures (not common in cats)


The types of symptoms your cat displays and the severity of the Q fever will ultimately depend on the particular strain of organism your cat is infected with. Often, animals with C. burnetii will undergo a period of latency (inactivity). However, during the birthing process the bacterium may reactivate, resulting in large numbers of bacteria entering the placenta, and the host's bodily fluids, urine, feces, and milk.

"
162,Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency in Cats," and Types

 


	Anemia
	Weakness
	Muscle wasting
	Jaundice (rare)
	Pale mucous membranes

	Inability to perform routine exercises


 

"
163,Pyometra in Cats," of Pyometra in Cats
The symptoms of pyometra can vary from subtle (almost unnoticeable) to severe lethargy, vomiting and weakness. Symptoms vary greatly because of a female cat’s opening from the vagina to the uterus called the cervix. This part of the body opens, or dilates, during labor and delivery, as well as during heat. It then closes following heat (or after a cat gives birth). If the cervix is still open, when pyometra develops, the pus can drain out of the body. Cats with an open cervix, or “open pyometra,” are much less sick than those with a closed cervix, “closed pyometra.”  

When the cervix is closed, it traps the pus inside the uterus which can result in the pet becoming septic and toxic shock developing quickly.  

Common signs of pyometra include:  


	
	Pus draining from the vulva: This can be difficult to spot because cats are very meticulous about grooming. Watch for any drainage around the base of the tail or on bedding.  
	
	
	Lethargy, depression, or weakness 
	
	
	Anorexia or decreased appetite 
	
	
	Increased thirst 
	



	
	Vomit or diarrhea 
	
	
	Fever

169,Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats," develop early, with blindness within a few months of birth. This type has a dominant mode of inheritance.


Symptoms of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Most cats will begin to experience night blindness initially, because the condition affects the rod photoreceptor cells first. Vision loss will gradually worsen over the months and years. PRA affects both eyes.

Other symptoms you may notice include:


	Disorientation and bumping into objects
	Difficulty finding food and water bowls, or toys
	Reluctance to go up or down stairs, or enter a dark room
	Reclusive at night
	Dilated pupils
	Sluggish pupillary light reflexes, as well as diminished or loss of other eye-related reflexes
	Greater reflectiveness (sheen) of the eye
	Cataracts, which often manifest as white-opaque crystalline deposits in the eyes, occur usually as a secondary complication


"
170,Poxvirus Infection in Cats," and Types

Skin lesions are one of the primary symptoms of poxvirus infection in cats. These lesions may develop immediately, or they may be secondary, developing after one to three weeks. The lesions are generally circular and crusty, and multiple lesions usually develop on the head, neck, or forelimbs. In approximately 20 percent of cases, lesions appear in the mouth (oral lesions).

In some cases, additional systematic symptoms may appear, including anorexia, sluggishness, vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, and discharge from the eyes (conjunctivitis).

176,Poisoning by Hypercalcemic Agents and Their Treatments in Cats," of poisoning may show 18 to 36 hours after the cholecalciferol containing poison was consumed. Left untreated, a cat can die from cholecalciferol poisoning and the resulting hypercalcemia. For the cat that does survive, it will continue to have elevated calcium levels for weeks after the poisoning, and this excess of calcium can lead to secondary health problems, such as renal (kidney) failure.

Symptoms


	Increased thirst
	Frequent urination
	Vomiting
	Generalized weakness
	Muscle spasms
	Seizures
	Fatigue
	Elevated blood serum calcium


"
177,Pneumonia (Interstitial) in Cats," and Types

Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the disease. Some symptoms that may appear in the cat include tachypnea, coughing, dyspnea, mild fever, and discharge from the eyes. Exposure to toxic elements, for example, may also result in gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and a decreased amount of urine production.

"
178,Pneumonia in Cats," of Pneumonia in Cats
Symptoms of pneumonia may appear slowly or quickly, depending on the type and severity of the infection. Symptoms may include:

Is Pneumonia Contagious to Other Cats?

Certain infectious (viral or bacterial) types of pneumonia can be contagious to other cats, and even dogs, but this is rare.

If your veterinarian suspects a contagious cause of your cat’s pneumonia, it is recommended to separate your sick cat from other pets in your household.

Certain infectious organisms can live on your sick pet’s food, water bowl, litter box, and toys. These items should not be shared between healthy and ill pets and should be washed often. Also, wash your hands after you tend to your sick kitty to prevent the spread of germs.

"
179,Pneumonia (Fungal) in Cats," and Types

Symptoms of fungal pneumonia may include a history of anorexia and corresponding weight loss, fever, discharge from the nose or eyes, coughing, difficulty breathing, lameness, and eye problems, possibly as severe as sudden blindness. A physical exam may also reveal depression, emaciation, and a crackling sound in the cat's lungs while breathing.

"
180,Pneumonia (Bacterial) in Cats," and Types



Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, lack of appetite and consequent weight loss, sluggishness, nasal discharge, dehydration, and rapid breathing. Intolerance to exercise due to breathing difficulties may also be apparent. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal abnormal breathing sounds, a diagnostic process known as auscultation. Symptoms may include short rough snapping sounds known as crackles and whistling sounds known as wheezes.



Causes



"
181,Pleural Effusion in Cats (Fluid Around the Lungs)," of Pleural Effusion in Cats
Cats with pleural effusion typically have a combination of the following symptoms:


	
	Rapid breathing
	
	
	Shallow breathing
	
	
	Working harder than normal to breathe
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Depending on how long the effusion has been present, how severe it is, and its underlying cause, you may also notice:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Blue-tinged or pale mucous membranes (around the eyes, nose, and mouth)
	
	
	An enlarged abdomen
	
	
	Signs of discomfort or pain
	
	
	Weakness
	


Take your cat to a veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately if they are having trouble breathing or the symptoms seemed to come on suddenly. Your cat’s life may be in danger if you wait too long.

On the other hand, mild symptoms that come on slowly (over the course of days or weeks rather than hours) are rarely an emergency. Call your regular veterinarian for advice if your cat doesn’t seem to be in distress, particularly if you already know the cause of your cat’s pleural effusion. You can also chat with a veterinary expert through Chewy’s Connect With a Vet service for insight on next steps.

"
182,Plague in Cats," of Plague in Cats 
In mammals, plague is transmitted through flea bites (bubonic), contact with contaminated fluid or tissue (septicemic), or infectious droplets (pneumonic). 

Cats are most commonly affected by bubonic plague. The bacterium enters the body through the cat’s mouth after ingesting an infected animal, or through the skin from a flea bite that travels to the lymph nodes. Onset of symptoms is one to four days after exposure and includes:


	
	Fever (up to 106 F)
	
	
	Decreased appetite (anorexia)
	
	
	Lethargy          
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes, especially under the jaw
	


Septicemic plague occurs when the bacterium continues to spread through the bloodstream and affects organs including the spleen, liver, and heart. In this case, lymph nodes will not be enlarged, but the cat will likely still have the other signs of bubonic plague. Additional symptoms may include: 


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Elevated heart rate
	
	
	Trouble breathing
	
	
	Shock
	


Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. Cats with pneumonic plague have all the clinical signs of septicemic plague in addition to:


	
	Cough
	
	
	Abnormal lung sounds, such as crackles and wheezes

	Are affected on multiple feet
	
	
	Initially have no ulcerations, but deep fissure lines (deep linear cracks) are present
	
	
	Are deep pink or purple in color with multiple white striations 
	
	
	May indent in response to pressure, then become puffy when pressure is removed
	
	
	Eventually may break open, resulting in limping or lameness
	
In some rare cases, the following symptoms can also be seen due to the increased numbers of plasma cells being generated in the body:


	Swelling at the bridge of the nose
	
	
	Upper respiratory tract infection 
	
	
	Inflammation of gum tissue and the lining of the mouth (stomatitis) 
	
	
	Glomerulonephritis (inflammation and dysfunction of the capillaries in the kidneys)

"
186,Peritonitis in Cats," of Peritonitis in Cats
Common symptoms of peritonitis in cats include:


	
	Abdominal pain: You may notice your cat vocalizing when you pick them up, or they may have a bloated, firm abdomen and not move around much due to discomfort.
	
	
	Increased heart rate or breathing rate, often associated with discomfort
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Restlessness or not being able to get into a comfortable position. Your cat may also get into a stretching position where their head is lowered and rear end is up; this helps relieve pressure from the abdominal organs.
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy/weakness/collapse
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Jaundice: Yellow discoloration of the skin, eyes, and ears can be a sign of specific types of peritonitis associated with liver/gallbladder disease or certain viruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).
	


Causes of Peritonitis in Cats
Any foreign material or infections released into the peritoneal cavity cause irritation and start a systemic inflammatory response. This causes white blood cells to move into the peritoneal cavity, as well as more leaking of the blood vessels and lymphatics in the region.

The loss of fluid, white blood cells, and proteins into the abdomen decreases the movement of oxygenated blood through body tissues and organs. This eventually leads to cell death and organ failure if untreated or, unfortunately, sometimes even with treatment.

"
188,Pelger-Huët Anomaly in Cats," and Types
 
There are two types of this benign defect: heterozygous and homozygous. The heterozygous version is more common and is recognized because the cat's mature neutrophils resemble bands (slightly immature neutrophils) and metamyelocytes (a predecessor of granular leukocytes). Heterozygous anomaly is not associated with immunodeficiency, with predisposition to infection, or with abnormalities of leukocyte (white blood cell) function. Conversely, the homozygous anomaly is usually lethal in utero. Cats that survive may have leukocytes with round to oval nuclei on a stained blood smear.  
 
Skeletal abnormalities and abnormal development of cartilage were reported in one stillborn homozygous kitten; however, a direct link with Pelger-Huët anomaly has not been conclusively confirmed.

197,Paraneoplastic Syndromes in Cats," depend on the response of the tissue or organ that is being targeted.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms will vary greatly depending on the type of tumor and on the organ system being affected by the abnormal secretions from such tumors. This type of disorder is most commonly related to a malignant tumor, but it can also result from a benign tumor that is secreting hormones. This latter type of tumor is rarer than the malignant type, in this instance. The most common types of PNS in cats will display as symptoms of anorexia – a complete loss of appetite, in a wasting away of the body, and in dermatological disorders.

"
204,Pancreatic Cancer in Cats,"



The most common symptom of an insulinoma is physical collapse or loss of consciousness (syncope). Seizures, extreme weakness, and other neurological abnormalities are also common. Because the insulin is released periodically, symptoms are not consistent and frequency of symptoms is not necessarily predictable.

207,Pain from the Nervous System in Cats," and Types

 

Damage to the tissues of the body, and the nerves running through them, creates a constant (chronic) pain that is brought on by a light touch to the affected area and/or a heightened perception of pain. Pain originating within the spinal cord causes problems with mobility and various functions of the body.

 

Some of the symptoms of neuropathic pain may include:




	Limping or dragging a limb
	Shaking or twitching of the skin
	Chewing on the affected area
	Muscle wasting (atrophy)

"
208,"Pain (Acute, Chronic and Postoperative) in Cats"," and Types

The most common sign that a cat is in pain will be a vocal cue or a sign of significant agitation. Some cats will become extremely sensitive to touch and stimuli that would normally not cause them any discomfort. Cats that are experiencing long-term pain may exhibit signs of depression, reduction in appetite, trembling, and even biting/snapping when someone reaches out to pet them. Cats that are experiencing a sudden, sharp pain may experience rapid, shallow breathing, a rise in blood pressure and an increased heart rate.

"
211,Out-of-place Urethral Lining in Cats," and Types

A prolapsed urethra often looks similar to a pea-sized mass, and may be red or purple in color. This can often be observed as a small mass of tissue on the end of the penis (or in a female, protruding from the urethral tract).

If the cat excessively licks the mass, it can become enlarged or inflamed. In some cases, the protrusion can bleed on or around the urethral opening. Cats with urethral prolapse usually have difficulties urinating.

"
212,Osteosarcoma In Cats," of Osteosarcoma in Cats
One of the first signs of OSA in cats may be a change in behavior or the development of lameness.  Bone cancer in cats is extremely painful. Your cat may stop eating and may be withdrawn, more irritable, and aggressive. 

The symptoms of OSA are often related to where the tumor originated. For example, if your cat’s tumor affects one of their limbs, you may notice lameness, swelling, and pain to the touch at the site as well as a reluctance to walk, run, or jump.

If the tumor affects the cat’s jaw, then you may notice your cat having difficulty eating, swallowing, or opening and closing the mouth, and they may lose weight as a result.

As the bone cancer progresses, fractures can occur. You may notice an acute start of lameness, disuse of the limb, misalignment of the jaw, and a refusal to walk altogether. If you notice any signs of a broken bone, your cat should be examined by your veterinarian immediately.

"
213,Osteomyelitis in Cats," of Osteomyelitis in Cats

A cat with a more chronic bone infection may no longer have a fever or be lethargic. However, the cat will likely still be limping or not walking normally, and will have muscle-wasting due to not using the sore part of the body appropriately. There also may be open draining wounds over the sites of swelling, both early on and later in infection.

"
214,Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats," of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats

"
216,Optic Nerve Swelling in Cats," and Types

Optic neuritis may be a primary disease or a secondary disease, meaning it occurs due to the presence of another disease in the body, such as a central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Optic neuritis is secondary to systematic CNS disease because the optic nerve communicates with the outermost layers of the brain (subarachnoid space).

Symptoms of optic neuritis include acute (sudden) onset of blindness and partial deficiencies in vision. A physical examination can reveal blindness or reduced vision in one or both eyes, fixed and dilated pupils, and a diminished light reflex of pupils. An examination of the anterior surface of the eye cavity may reveal a swollen optic disk, or a focal hemorrhage.

Causes
 
As previously mentioned, primary optic neuritis is very rare, while secondary optic neuritis is more common. "

"
235,Narcolepsy and Cataplexy in Cats," and Types

A cat that has either of these conditions will not always have any secondary or underlying conditions related to it. A physical exam will usually show normal physical and neurologic responses with no obvious abnormalities. This is not a fatal disease, but it is one that requires attention and awareness. Narcoleptic and cataplectic episodes can last from several seconds up to 30 minutes, and often will take place when the cat is eating, playing, excited, or is engaging in sexual activity. Cataplexy in particular is characterized by episodes that occur during moments of heightened emotion. During a narcoleptic episode, the affected cat will collapse onto its side or stomach, its muscles will slacken, and all physical movement briefly ceases. It is just as if the cat has suddenly fallen into a deep sleep. Closed eye movement continues, as with the stage of REM sleep. During a cataplectic episode, the cat is aware and conscious of what is going on around it, its eyes  remain open and under the cat's control, but it is otherwise paralyzed. The cat typically will come out of the episode in response to external stimuli, such as when it hears a loud sound or is petted.

Some of the usual symptoms of narcolepsy and cataplexy are:


    Rapid 	onset of episodes, with no apparent warning of imminent collapse
    Sudden 	loss of consciousness
    Paralysis 	of limbs, head, and torso
    Episodes 	last from several seconds up to 30 minutes

	Vomiting
	Abnormal increase in sensitivity to various stimuli (hyperesthesia)


 

"
251,Megaesophagus in Cats," of Megaesophagus in Cats
The most common clinical sign of megaesophagus is regurgitation—which differs from vomiting. Regurgitation is a passive response that expels the contents from the esophagus, usually before the food reaches the stomach. Regurgitation can be delayed for several hours, or it can occur shortly after eating. Many times, the regurgitated food can still be seen in a tubular form and appear undigested.



If the megaesophagus is related to a neurological condition, neurological signs like generalized muscle weakness, muscle wasting or atrophy, and pain may be noted. Pet parents may notice that their cat has difficulty breathing (dyspnea), a cough, or a fever, suggesting aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of megaesophagus.

"
252,Megacolon in Cats," of Megacolon in Cats
The most common clinical signs of megacolon in cats include:


	
	Severe, painful constipation
	
	
	Fewer bowel movements
	
	
	Unusually hard feces
	


You may also see watery diarrhea when the liquid stool is forced around a stuck fecal ball or mass.

As megacolon progresses, your cat may:


	
	Lose weight
	
	
	Have less energy
	
	
	Lose their appetite
	
	
	Vomit
	
	
	Have a firm, palpable mass in their abdomen, depending on their body condition
	
	
	Become dehydrated
	


"
253,Maternal Behavior Problems in Female Cats," and Types

Inadequate Maternal Behavior 

    Abandons her own newborn pups 	(most common after caesarean section)
    Does not allow her offspring to 	nurse
    Insufficient cleaning of the young
    Inadequate retrieval of the young
    Failure to stimulate elimination
    Attacking and/or killing some or 	all of the newborn, especially if it has a different odor or 	appearance
    If disturbed by people or other 	animals, may redirect her aggression to her young


Excessive Maternal Behavior 

    Un-bred mother may attempt to 	nurse unfamiliar pups
    Guarding of inanimate objects such 	as stuffed animals
    An increase in the size of mammary 	glands


"
254,Mastitis in Cats," of Mastitis in Cats
When mammary glands are inflamed, they may be:


	
	Warm to the touch
	
	
	Red
	
	
	Swollen
	
	
	Firmer than normal
	
	
	Painful
	


The milk that comes out of the nipple can be unusually thick and contain visible blood or pus. In severe cases, the skin over the gland may become dark and ulcerated (having an open sore). If an infection has led to an abscess (a pocket of pus), it can burst, and you may notice drainage of blood and pus from a wound on the skin.

At first, cats with mastitis may not seem to feel sick, but systemic signs of infection often develop with time. These may include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	


Because mastitis is painful, cats may not want to nurse, which can lead to poor weight gain in their kittens.

"
255,Mast Cell Tumors in Cats," of Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
Clinical signs and symptoms can vary depending on where the mast cell tumor is located and how aggressive (if malignant) the tumor is. Mast cell tumors on the spleen, or within the intestinal tract, will be more likely to cause systemic (whole-body) signs:


	
	Cutaneous:

	
		
		Hard, hairless, flattened bumps (plaques) located commonly on the head and neck, but can develop anywhere on the body
		
		
		Small lumps (nodules) that feel very firm within the skin
		
		
		Excessive itchiness and associated hair loss
		
		
		Ulceration (an open sore)
		
	
	
	
	Splenic or visceral:

	
		
		Vomiting
		
		
		Weight loss
		
		
		Poor appetite
		
	
	
	
	Intestinal:

	
		
		Vomiting and diarrhea
		
		
		Fresh blood in the stool
		
		
		Black or tarry stool, indicating digested blood
		
	
	


"
256,Mass Protrusion from the Vaginal Area in Cats," and Types

There are several signs that may be noticed with this medical disorder, including the licking of the vaginal area, unwillingness to copulate, and painful urination (dysuria).

Type 1 hyperplasia occurs when there is a slight protrusion of the mass, even though it does not exit the vulva itself. Type 2 hyperplasia, on the other hand, is when the vaginal tissue actually protrudes through the vulvar opening. Type 3 hyperplasia refers to the donut-shaped mass which can be seen externally.

"
259,Mange in Cats," of Mange in Cats
As you can imagine, mange mites that crawl on or burrow into a cat’s skin create a lot of discomfort.

Symptoms of mange in cats can include:


	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Itching
	
	
	Skin lesions such as:

	
		
		Rashes

"
261,Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats," of Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
Most cases of malignant hyperthermia in cats occur under anesthesia; therefore, you as the pet parent won’t be present to see the signs. However, as malignant hyperthermia has also occurred during times of stress or exercise, it’s important to be aware of what to look out for and when to seek medical attention.

Common signs are:


	
	Tachycardia (higher than normal heart rate)
	
	
	Tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing)
	
	
	Fever, often reaching >106 F
	
	
	Muscle rigidity

	Weight loss
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Appetite changes
	
	
	A mass or firm growth in the abdomen
	


Other forms of lymphoma outside the GI tract have varying signs, depending on which system is affected. Cats with mediastinal lymphoma may struggle to breath and have trouble inflating their lungs due to the presence of a mass in their chest.

Cats with renal lymphoma often present with signs of kidney disease, like increased drinking and urinating, weight loss, and nausea.

Cats with multicentric lymphoma often have firm hard swellings under the chin, on the shoulder, and behind the knee, while nasal lymphoma symptoms can include sneezing or nasal drainage.

"
265,Lymph Node Inflammation (Lymphadenitis) in Cats," and Types



Lymphadenitis seldom causes lymph node enlargement that is severe enough for someone unfamiliar with veterinary medicine to observe. Your cat's doctor, however, will be able to locate the firm nodes through palpation, which is often painful for the animal. The cat may also have a fever, suffer from inappetance (anorexia), or display other systemic signs of infection. Bacterial infections, in particular, may develop abscesses within the nodes, which may open to the exterior and present as draining tracts. Other complications will depend on the location of the infection and whether it is affecting surrounding organs.



"
266,Lymphadenopathy in Cats," of Lymphadenopathy in Cats
Other than lymph node enlargement, other symptoms depend on the underlying cause of the swollen lymph nodes. They include:

	Poor appetite
	
	
	Trouble eating
	
	
	Labored/fast breathing

	Weight loss
	
	
	Lymph node pain/heat
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	


"
267,Lyme Disease in Cats," of Lyme Disease in Cats 
Cats rarely have signs of Lyme disease. While humans commonly see a red “bull’s eye” rash around the bite, this is uncommon for dogs and cats. Black fly bites are commonly mistaken for a Lyme rash, and a veterinarian should carefully examine the pet.

The most common symptoms, when present, include:


	
	Lameness
	
	
	Fatigue
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Fever
	


Animals with a more severe form of Lyme affecting their kidneys may show:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Severe lethargy
	
	
	Edema (swelling caused by excess fluid) in the limbs
	


Severe cases may cause damage to the nervous system and heart.

"
268,Luxating Patellas in Cats," of Luxating Patella in Cats 
Symptoms of luxating patella in cats include: 


	
	Occasional or constant limping 
	
	
	Difficulty jumping onto things like beds and tables 
	
	
	“Skipping” on a back leg (holding it up for a few steps then replacing weight onto that leg) 
	


As the grade of the luxation increases, so does the lameness. Cats with grades III and IV tend to show persistent lameness and, if both of their knees are affected, they can even have a bow-legged or dropped stance/crouched appearance in the back legs. 

With arthritis, a cat may yowl, cry, or make other noises indicating pain or discomfort when getting up from their current position. Your cat may also be unwilling to move around, making it easy to confuse this behavior with lethargy or poor appetite, when in reality the cat is just too sore to get up, play, and eat or drink.

"
275,Lower Eyelid Drooping in Cats," and Types

Protrusion of the lower eyelid — with lack of contact of the lower lid to the eye globe, and exposure of the palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva and the third eyelid — can usually be plainly seen. Other signs and symptoms include:


    Facial      staining caused by poor tear drainage (i.e., tears spill over onto the      face instead of passing from the eye to the nose via the tear ducts)
    Excess      eye discharge due to conjunctival exposure
    Recurrent      foreign object irritation
    History      of bacterial conjunctivitis      (inflammation of the conjunctiva)


Causes

Ectroprion in cats is usually secondary to breed-associated alterations in facial conformation and eyelid support. The condition is seen more frequently in Persians and Himalayans. Other possible causes include:

    Marked      weight loss or muscle mass of the head and eye orbits
    Scarring      of the eyelids secondary to injury, or after overcorrection of entropion (a      medical condition in which the eyelids fold inward)

  
Diagnosis

A thorough eye exam will be conducted to look for evidence of the eyelid malformation and for corneal ulcerations. A fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions or foreign objects. In cats with late-age onset, an underlying disorder will be considered as a causative factor. Nerve paralysis in the eye, a condition associated with lack of muscle tone of the eye muscles, will be considered.



Treatment

Your veterinarian will prescribe supportive care in the form of a topical lubricant, or an antibiotic-containing ointment, along with good eye and facial hygiene, which should be sufficient for most mild forms of the disease. Surgical treatment may be required to shorten the eyelid, and for severely affected patients with chronic ocular (eye) irritation, a radical face lift may need to be performed to correct the disorder. Your veterinarian will help you to develop a treatment plan to treat both the symptoms and any underlying conditions.

Living and Management

This condition may become more severe as your cat ages, and will need to be monitored by your veterinarian on a regular basis so that infections, should they occur, do not become severe, and related eye disorders can be treated with immediacy.

Ectropion is a condition which describes the margin of the eyelid rolling outward, resulting in exposure of the sensitive tissue (conjunctiva) lining the inside of the eyelid. Exposure and poor tear distribution may predispose the patient to sight-threatening corneal disease.

It occurs most commonly in dogs but is rarely seen in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Protrusion of the lower eyelid — with lack of contact of the lower lid to the eye globe, and exposure of the palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva and the third eyelid — can usually be plainly seen. Other signs and symptoms include:


    Facial      staining caused by poor tear drainage (i.e., tears spill over onto the      face instead of passing from the eye to the nose via the tear ducts)

"
280,Loss of Hair in Cats," to Check For With Hair Loss in Cats
Cats with alopecia can have patches of hair loss in one area of the body or in multiple areas. The locations vary based on the underlying cause of hair loss. Cat alopecia may be inflammatory or non-inflammatory, meaning that the skin may appear red and irritated, or it may appear normal.

Cats with inflammatory alopecia may show a number of symptoms:


	
	Be obviously itchy and seem to lick, bite, gnaw, and scratch at their skin more than normal.
	
	
	Experience an increase in hairballs.
	
	
	Have other skin abnormalities such as redness, bumps, scabs, sores, or crusts.
	


It is important to note that just because you don’t see signs of itchiness, that doesn’t mean your cat is not itchy. Often, cats hide those behaviors, only to gnaw and scratch when they are hidden from view.

If there is an underlying systemic disease affecting your cat, you may see these signs:


	
	Changes in appetite
	
	
	Vomiting and/or diarrhea
	
	
	Changes in energy level
	
	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Enlarged abdomen or a pot-belly appearance
	


Cats with allergies may also experience additional symptoms:


	
	Conjunctivitis
	
	
	Inflammation of the ears
	


"
281,Lockjaw in Cats," and Types
 
Symptoms can appear after spores have entered the wound and germinated. The muscles around the infected wound may become rigid first. The animal may appear stiff and lame. Weakness and an uncoordinated gait can usually be observed in these animals. The symptoms may then disappear spontaneously in some animals if the infection remains local to the area in which it entered the body, while in other animals the symptoms can escalate to a generalized disease if the toxins are able to gain access to the nervous system.

The symptoms related to generalized disease are:


    Fever
    Constipation
    Pain during urination
    Excessive drooling
    Wrinkled forehead
    Grinning appearance
    Stiff and hard tail
    Continuously erect and stiff ears
    Progressive stiffness of the body muscles, giving the animal a sawhorse appearance
    Difficulty eating
    Breathing difficulty (due to stiffness of the chest muscles)

288,Liver Failure (Acute) in Cats,"



Primary and secondary hepatobiliary disorders - those dealing with the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts or bile - are generally associated with variable hepatic necrosis. However, acute liver failure from severe hepatic necrosis is an uncommon phenomenon. Acute liver failure can affect the body through a number of system failures:




	Gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the stool (hematochezia)
	Nervous system: hepatic encephalopathy (brain disease related to liver failure)
	Hepatobiliary: the liver plus the gallbladder; jaundice, necrosis (tissue death) of the liver cells and bile duct cells

	Noisy breathing
	Raspy meow/voice change
	Coughing
	Lethargy
	Increased respiratory rate and/or increased respiratory effort

Some symptoms that may occur include blood in urine (hematuria), vomiting, recurrent urinary tract infections, painful difficult urination (dysuria), and frequent urination with small volume of production (polyuria). Other symptoms may appear but vary depending on the location and type of the stones.



Note that some nephroliths may be “inactive”; meaning, they are not infected, not progressively enlarging, and not causing obstruction or clinical signs. Inactive kidney stones may not require removal, but should be monitored periodically (via urine analysis for example) for any changes.



"
303,Kidney Inflammation Due to Fluid Accumulation in Cats," and Types
 
Although most cats with a perirenal pseudocyst have a nonpainful, enlarged abdomen, some may not display any symptoms (asymptomatic). In severe cases, symptoms of renal failure may manifest.
 
Cause

"
307,Kidney Failure and Excess Urea in the Urine in Cats," and Types



As this potentially toxic blood flows through the cat's body, most systems are affected, including the urinary, digestive, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and immune systems.



Upon examination, cats will appear to be in normal physical condition, but may appear to be in a depressed state. When symptoms are apparent, signs can include loss of appetite, listlessness, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be tinted with blood. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the tongue, ammonia-smelling breath (due to the urea), ulcers in the mouth, fever, abnormally fast or slow pulse, decreased or increased urine output, and even seizures. The kidneys may feel enlarged, tender, and firm on palpation.

"
311,Kidney Disease Caused by Multiple Cysts in Cats," and Types



Polycystic kidney disease may be difficult to detect in the initial stages. The cysts often remain undetected until they become large and numerous enough to contribute to kidney failure or an enlarged abdomen. Most cats do not exhibit any symptoms during initial stages of cyst formation and growth.



Once the disease has progressed, bosselated (lumpy) kidneys may be detected. This is discovered during an abdominal palpatation, in which the abdominal muscles twitch uncontrollably.



Most renal cysts are not painful, so the cat may not exhibit any discomfort, but secondary infection associated with the cysts may result in later discomfort.

It’s important to mention to your veterinarian if your cat has a habit of playing with string or getting into the garbage—or if you’ve witnessed your cat chewing and/or swallowing something inappropriate.

As cats tend to ingest string and similar items while playing with them, these objects have been known to become lodged under the tongue. If you or your veterinarian notice something under the tongue, or if you notice material protruding from your cat’s rectum, do not pull on it! It is often tethered elsewhere and can cause more harm if you attempt to remove it.

"
331,Inter-cat Aggression," and Types 



Overt Aggression  

Overt aggression is any hostile behavior that is obvious. The most clear sign of aggression is attacking and fighting, but before that there are other signs that can be observed; clear indications that there is going to be trouble. If you become aware of this behavior, you can be sure that without intervention, there is going to be a fight.



Behavior typical of the aggressor includes staring the other cat down, hissing and swiping at the other cat, raising its back and hackles (the erectile hairs on the back are raised), and thrashing its tail back and forth. Involuntary physical reactions to aggression will also show. The ears will be flattened back against the head, and the eyes will be dilated. The aggressor will mark areas of the home to establish its dominance, either by using the scent glands under its chin, or by urinating.



Covert Aggression  

Covert aggression is less apparent. The aggressor will use different methods to keep its rival away from resources like food and water, the litter box, and sleeping areas. Human attention will also be an opportunity for the aggressor cat to show its dominance, as it will block the other cat from receiving attention or even getting near to people. Favored areas of the victim cat may be marked by the aggressor, causing the victim to avoid those areas. The victim will urinate and defecate in other places in the house if it is kept away from the litter box.



"
332,Insufficient Urine Production in Cats," and Types



Generally, a key symptom of oliguria or anuria is a decreased amount of urine being produced and excreted. Additional symptoms vary depending on the type of oliguria or anuria present. Signs of physiologic oliguria include dehydration, pale mucous membranes, a weak pulse, a rapid or irregular pulse, and a history of fluid loss (through excessive vomiting or diarrhea, for example). Signs of pathologic oliguria typically include a history of progressive kidney disease with symptoms such as poor appetite and weight loss. Signs of anuria may be observed during a physical examination, with revealing symptoms such as fluid infiltration into the tissues surrounding the urinary tract, and pain in the abdomen on palpation.



"
333,Insecticide Toxicity in Cats," and Types



Cats exposed to toxic chemicals may not exhibit all of the signs of poisoning. In fact, sometimes insecticides will cause the opposite of these symptoms instead, but there will usually be some indication that the cat is not well. If you suspect that your pet is unwell because of exposure to insecticides, you will need to remove your cat from the toxic environment, or cease using the insecticides, and seek medical attention for it before the condition becomes dire.



The following are some of the symptoms of toxic poisoning:




	Fever
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Anorexia
	Depression
	Seizures
	Muscle tremors
	Hypersalivation
	Constricted pupils
	Increased heart rate
	Lack of coordination (i.e., trouble walking)
	Respiratory failure (e.g., trouble breathing)




Toxic levels of carbamate insecticides like methomyl and carbofuran can cause seizures and respiratory arrest in your cat. Organophosphate toxicity, meanwhile, may lead to chronic anorexia, muscle weakness and muscle twitching which may last for days or even weeks. Someorganophosphate insecticides commonly used include coumaphos, cyothioate, diazinon, fampfhur, fention, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos.



This same kind of poisoning can occur with agricultural, lawn and garden insecticide products. Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl.



This same kind of poisoning can occur with agricultural, lawn and garden insecticide products. Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos (which is especially toxic to cats), diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl.



Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides inhibit cholinesterases and acetylcholinesterase, essential enzymes in the body. Cholinesterases are enzymes which break down acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter.



Consequently, acetylcholine remains attached to the postsynaptic receptors of the neurons causing continuous, unending nervous transmission to nervous tissue, organs and muscles (smooth and skeletal). This causes seizures and shaking.

"
360,Hot Spots on Cats," of Hot Spots on Cats
A hot spot–induced skin infection is initially moist, itchy, and inflamed, usually causing the skin in the area to turn red with or without hair loss. The infection then leads to pus formation, causing the wound to become more wet. The moisture is then trapped in the remaining hair, causing mats to form on top of the wound.

The pus will dry and the damaged skin will adhere to this infection site, causing a crusty, moist bed of infection that is likely very uncomfortable to your cat. The matted fur will often disguise how severely affected the underlying skin might be. The chewing, biting, or scratching makes the hot spot much worse, so the sooner you can have your cat examined by their vet the better.

"
388,Heart Murmur in Cats," of Heart Murmur in Cats
Pet parents will typically not notice any symptoms in cats until heart disease progresses and signs of congestive heart failure or thromboembolism (blood clots) develop. Heart murmurs are usually found incidentally during a routine physical examination. Your veterinarian will discuss possible causes and next steps for diagnosis.   

Symptoms of severe heart disease, heart failure, and thromboembolism include: 


	
	Chronic weight loss or muscle wasting 
	



	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Hiding behavior

"
389,Heart Medicine Poisoning in Cats," and Types

One of the most significant concerns about this condition is toxicity to the heart cells themselves, called myocardial toxicity. When this occurs, abnormal heart rhythms can occur, often leading to heart failure.

Depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are often the first symptoms your cat will display. This can occur even when the medication is given at the prescribed dose because  therapeutic and toxic levels are very close.

With acute overdose, your cat may become comatose or have seizures. Any time toxicity is a concern, it is important to consult with your veterinarian, as the effects of toxicity can progress quickly.

    Usually 	asymptomatic (without symptoms)
    Weakness
    Fainting
    Pale 	gums
    Very 	slow heart rate, may be possible to detect


Sinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only.

Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity)  and Mobitz type II.

First-degree 	sinoatrial block     

    Slowed 		conduction 

Second-degree 	sinoatrial block

    Failure 		to conduct is intermittent
    Two 		types of second-degree SA block occur:
    
        Mobitz 			type I/Wenckebach periodicity – speed of conduction slows 			gradually until failure of impulses to reach the atria occurs
        Mobitz 			type II – block is all, or none, until complete conduction 			failure takes place
        The 			two types cannot be differentiated on a surface ECG 
    
    

Third-degree 	sinoatrial block     

    Complete 		failure to conduct


"
392,Heart Failure in Cats," of Heart Failure in Cats
Heart failure usually starts as a progression of heart disease, with few symptoms to even suggest your cat is sick. Cats can play, eat normally, and have normal bowel movements early in heart disease. It is important to remember that heart disease is not heart failure, although heart disease may eventually lead to heart failure.

As heart disease advances, pet parents may start to notice some signs and symptoms. Cats may begin to cough, become lethargic, not eat as well, and even become out of breath or pant during normal activities such as walking or playing. If left undetected, this can develop into heart failure. If left unchecked, the condition is likely to be fatal.

If your cat is experiencing any symptoms of heart disease or failure, take them to a veterinarian immediately. If your cat appears to be healthy, a full physical exam is recommended annually with your veterinarian to detect early signs.

"
393,"Heart Failure, Congestive (Right-sided) in Cats","

"
410,Heart Attacks in Cats," of Heart Attacks in Cats
Many symptoms of a heart attack in cats are nonspecific and can be caused by a variety of conditions.

Taking your cat to a veterinarian for the right diagnosis is important if you notice any abnormal behaviors or symptoms.

Symptoms of heart attacks in cats may include:


	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Changes in heart rate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in behavior, such as hiding or vocalizing
	
	
	Collapse
	


Blood clots in the heart that cause a heart attack may also break off and travel down the aorta (main artery) to cause a blockage in a condition known as saddle thrombus. This can lead to back leg weakness, paralysis, or legs that feel cold to the touch, in addition to the symptoms listed above.

"
411,Heart (Aortic) Valve Narrowing in Cats," and Types
 
There are three types of three types of aortic stenosis: valvular (present at the valve), subvalvular (present below the valve), or supravalvular (present above the valve). The defect typically develops over the first few weeks to months of life; however, symptoms may appear at any age, depending on the severity of obstruction. Some of the more common symptoms include:
 

    Sudden loss of consciousness (syncope)
    Congestive heart failure
    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
    Abnormal lung sounds

 
"
412,Heart (Aortic) Blood Clot in Cats," and Types

	Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) is possible




"
414,Heart and Carotid Artery Tumors in Cats," and Types
 
Aortic body tumors occur on the aortic artery near the base of the heart. They are rarely of a malignant nature; they will grow within the space but not spread to the surrounding organs. These tumors become a health concern when their growth displaces the trachea, when they grow into the adjacent vessels, or when their growth places pressure on the atria or vena cava, impairing their functionality for conveying blood to the body and heart. Symptoms associated with aortic body tumors include:


    Coughing 
    Trouble breathing 
    Symptoms of right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF)
    Weakness, lethargy

 
Carotid body tumors, meanwhile, occur on the common carotid artery near the point of bifurcation -- where the artery splits into the internal and external carotid arteries. These arteries carry oxygenated blood to the head and neck, and are located in the neck. Because of this relation to the major arterial passages, carotid body tumors are often impossible to remove. In the majority of cases, these tumors remain slow growing but benign, and as with aortic tumors, they become a health issue when they invade the spaces of the adjacent blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. In an estimated 30 percent of cases, metastasis may occur into the surrounding organs, such as the lungs, bronchia or lymph nodes, or further into the liver or pancreas. Symptoms associated with carotid body tumors include:




    Regurgitation
    Vomiting 
    Trouble with eating (anorexia)
    Lump in the neck  

 
Other symptoms seen in cats affected by either body tumor type include:


    Severe hemorrhaging due to tumors in the blood vessels (can lead to sudden death)
    Metastasis to local blood vessels (up to 50 percent of cases )
    Organ failure due to cancerous growths (up to 20 percent of cases)



"
415,Hair Loss Related to Cancer in Cats," and Types



There are several symptoms that may be noticed by owners. Individually, the symptoms may be dismissed. But when seen in combination, a visit to the veterinarian should take place quickly. Excessive shedding is common and may be observed, as well as itching and more frequent grooming. A decrease in appetite and weight loss are also signs of a problem. Some cats will develop painful cracks on the pads of their feet and resist walking because of them.



A physical examination will likely involve checking the extent of hair loss, as well as how easily hair falls out. There may be gray spots in the areas of hair loss. The outermost layer of the skin will be examined to determine if it peels. Additionally, the veterinarian will probably check the cat’s footpads for cracks.

    Diluted urine
    Increased thirst and drinking (polydipsia and polyuria, respectively)
    Renal failure
    Urinary tract disease
    Possible systemic disease (in hyperglycemic glucosuria)                   


"
420,Glomerulonephritis in Cats," and Types

Symptoms may vary depending on the underlying cause, like inflammation, infection, or neoplasia. In some cats, the only presenting symptom may be weight loss and weakness. In fact, many times, the condition is discovered incidental to a routine annual health screening, when increased concentrations of proteins are found in the urine. If the protein loss into the urine is severe, the cat may develop an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites).

In cats suffering from advanced disease with kidney failure, there may be symptoms of increased thirst and frequency of urination, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Those with a severe deficiency of the blood protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia), may suffer from a blockage of the lung's blood vessels, which causes respiratory difficulties or severe panting. High blood pressure, meanwhile, may cause sudden blindness.

"

Cats that develop glaucoma may have


	Sudden blindness
	Red or cloudy eyes

	Different-sized pupils
	One eye that looks bigger than the other or that bulges out


Glaucoma is painful, and your cat may act different than normal due to pain. This can look like


	Hiding or avoiding interaction or play
	Sudden aggression
	Sleeping more than normal


Since glaucoma is mainly secondary to other diseases, cats may have signs of illness in other parts of their body which may include:


	Change in appetite
	Weight loss
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea

	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Decreased energy
	
	
	Frequent trips to the litter box
	


You will probably notice an irritated perianal region and excessive grooming to keep clean, which is unfortunately a source of continual reinfection.



It is also worth noting that cats (and other animals) can have the protozoa present in their intestines and still not show any symptoms. It is not known how often this is the case, as Giardia is not routinely tested for in cats unless they have diarrhea.

429,Fungal Toxicosis Related to Fusarium Fungus in Cats," and Types

Known symptoms of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol include a sudden refusal of food and/or vomiting after the ingestion of food contaminated by DON. The refusal of food with concurrent vomiting may also lead to subsequent weight loss. Note that if the contaminated food is removed and no longer given, these abnormal signs may resolve and no treatment will be necessary.

Studies have shown that vomiting in cats is common if DON concentration in food is greater than eight milligrams per kilogram of food.

	Eye discharge
	Diarrhea
	Fever, up to to 40 degrees Celsius (104.0 degrees Fahrenheit)
	Pale gums and moist body tissues (mucous membrane)
	Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenitis)




"
434,Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis) in Cats," and Types

 

There are two types of Aspergillus infections. The first is the nasal form, where the infection is localized in the nasal passages and front sinuses. It is believed that this develops from direct nasal contact with the fungus. For example, if a cat is outside and around dust and grass clippings, the fungus may enter via the moist lining of the nose. The most commonly associated symptoms are nasal discharge and noisy breathing during inhaling.

 

The second type of Aspergillus infection is disseminated, meaning it is more widespread in the body, not only in the nasal area. It is not certain how this form enters the body. Disseminated aspergillosis is most commonly associated with nonspecific signs, such as lethargy, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include protruding eyeballs.

 

"
435,Fungal Disease (Sporotrichosis) of the Skin in Cats," and Types



Cutaneous sporotrichosis


	Bumps, or lesions on the skin surface, swollen lymph glands
	Lesions often appear initially as wounds or abscesses mimicking wounds
	Associated with fighting, wounds may be found on the head, lumbar region, or distal limbs
	Previous trauma or puncture wound in the affected area is a variable finding
	Poor response to previous antibacterial therapy
	Combination of cutaneous and lymph form—usually an extension of the cutaneous form, which spreads via the lymphs, resulting in the formation of new nodules and draining tracts or crusts.
	Lymphadenopathy (disease of the lymphs) is common




Disseminated sporotrichosis


	Rare, occurs when the initial infection spreads into the body to a secondary location
	Systemic signs of malaise and fever
	Osteoarticular sporotrichosis occurs when the infection spreads into the bones and joints
	Sporotrichosis meningitis occurs when the infection spreads into the nervous system and brain
	Symptoms include loss of appetite (anorexia), and weight loss (cachexia)




Pulmonary sporotrichosis


	Occurs as a result of inhalation of Sporothrix schenckii spores

436,Frostbite in Cats," of Frostbite in Cats
Frostbite may not be evident for several days or weeks after exposure. If your cat has been outside on a windy day with freezing temperatures, it’s important to watch for the following signs of frostbite:


	
	Cold skin or extremities
	
	
	Discolored skin (white or pale, gray, blue, red, deep purple, or black)
	
	
	Skin that becomes red, swollen, or painful as it thaws
	
	
	Blisters that may be filled with blood
	
	
	Ulcers on skin
	
	
	Cold, fragile skin that breaks when touched
	
	
	Dead skin that sloughs off (the affected skin may gradually become blacker until it falls off)
	


Cold skin, discoloration of skin, and swelling and pain could be noticed shortly after exposure. It’s never a bad idea to call your vet with any concerns—they may have you monitor for signs of frostbite or bring your cat in for observation.

There are also degrees of frostbite that help define the severity of tissue damage and expected prognosis:


	
	First-degree frostbite results in erythema (redness) after the skin is rewarmed. This level of frostbite only affects the top layer of skin and doesn’t typically cause permanent injury.
	
	
	Second-degree frostbite results in blistering of the affected skin.
	
	
	Third- and fourth-degree frostbite both result in permanent damage, and the affected tissues are more susceptible to infection. Third-degree frostbite causes skin death, and fourth-degree frostbite causes gangrene (death of tissue) potentially resulting in the loss of the affected body part.
	


Cause of Frostbite in Cats
While frostbite usually happens at extremely cold temperatures, any cat living outdoors where temperatures get below 32 F (0 C) is at risk. Cats who are more at risk are kittens, senior cats, and cats with medical conditions that decrease blood flow to the extremities, including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, and hyperthyroidism.

Less commonly, there may be GI symptoms, including diarrhea and/or vomiting.

"
442,Folding of the Intestines," and Types

The clinical signs associated with the intussusception will depend on the anatomic region of the intussusception. If the intussusceptions occur in the gastroesophageal regions -- where the stomach and esophagus are located (gastroesophageal intussusception, or GEI) -- the signs are typically much more severe than if they occur in other regions.

In addition, if there is a total obstruction, the cat will have severe complications potentially and symptoms that are more severe. Whether partial or complete, obstruction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to hypovolemia, dehydration, and compromise of the venous and/or lymphatic systems. Prolonged obstruction can lead to necrosis (death of the tissue) and disruption of the normal capacity of the mucosal barrier that protects the GI tract, allowing bacteria and toxins to be absorbed into the GI tract.

Other common symptoms can include:

Intussusception high in the intestinal tract

    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Vomiting
    Bloody vomit (hematemesis)
    Regurgitation (inability to swallow food)
    Abdominal pain
    Abdominal distention


Intussusception low in the intestinal tract

    Bloody diarrhea (melena)
    Occasional vomiting
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Weight loss
    Straining to defecate (tenesmus)


"
443,FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease)," of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease
The most common symptom of FLUTD is your cat urinating outside the litter box (inappropriate urination). Inappropriate urination often occurs on clothes, bedding, and rugs. Some cats may choose one location, but others may urinate throughout the home.

Your cat may also make very frequent trips to the litter box but only pee small amounts at a time. Other symptoms include vocalizing while urinating and/or the presence of blood in the urine.

If you see your cat trying to use the litter box and producing no urine at all, or just a few small drops, bring them to the vet immediately. This may be a sign of the most severe FLUTD syndrome: urethral obstruction. This occurs more commonly in male cats but can occur in females as well.

"
444,Fluid Retention and Tissue Swelling Due to Collection of Lymph in Cats," and Types

The fluid accumulation (edema) is usually not painful and pits; that is, a depression develops if the skin is pushed with a finger (which eventually disappears if fibrosis occurs). Limb swelling, meanwhile, is present at birth or develops in the first several months. The swelling may be affect one or several limbs, and typically begins at the end of the limb and slowly moves upwards. In some cases, lameness and pain may also develop.

"
450,Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats," of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
If your cat has flea allergy dermatitis, their skin will appear red (erythema), be mildly to severely itchy (pruritus), and may have crusts or small bumps (papules). Most pet parents notice their cat scratching frequently and excessively grooming. You may also notice hair loss on the head, neck, or back (it can also occur on the abdomen and inner thighs). Any itching and hair loss in these locations is suggestive of flea allergy dermatitis.

"
451,FIV in Cats," of FIV in Cats
FIV infections are divided into three phases that can have very different symptoms:

Acute phase—During the one to two weeks after a cat has been infected with FIV, a cat can have:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	No symptoms
	


Latent phase—After recovering from their first symptoms, cats often go through a period of several months to years when they seem perfectly healthy. However, their immune system is being slowly weakened.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome—At this point, a cat’s immune system has become weak enough that they start developing secondary infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers (lymphoma and leukemia, for example), and other health problems. Symptoms will vary with the specific secondary disease(s) a cat has, but commonly include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Redness or sores in the mouth
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Eye inflammation (redness and swelling) and drainage
	
	
	Coughing or sneezing
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Neurologic problems like weakness, seizures, or odd behaviors
	


As time goes on, many of these secondary health problems will get worse and stop responding to treatment.

"
452,Fibrotic Hardening of the Lungs in Cats," and Types



The signs and symptoms displayed by the cat generally progress slowly; these include:




	Anorexia
	Cyanosis
	Lethargy
	Cough (nonproductive)
	Shortness of breath
	Increased respiratory rate and effort
	Open-mouth breathing/panting
	Exercise intolerance




"
453,Fever in Cats," of Fever in Cats
When your cat has a fever, they may:


	
	Feel lethargic
	
	
	Sleep more than usual
	
	
	Have a reduced appetite
	
	
	Hide
	
	
	Avoid activities they normally enjoy
	


Other symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, are possible depending on what is causing a cat’s fever. If your cat has any worrisome symptoms, call your veterinarian for an appointment.

How To Tell If a Cat Has a Fever

In addition to seeing symptoms like reduced activity and appetite, you may suspect a fever if your cat feels warmer to the touch than usual. This can be confirmed at home with a rectal or ear thermometer.

The only accurate way to determine if your cat has a fever is to take their temperature. Rectal temperatures are more accurate than aural (ear) temperatures and are easy to perform if your cat is relatively laid-back. Follow the instructions for either the thermometer to determine when the reading is complete. Any thermometer used on animals should not be used later on people.

454,Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)," of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Clinical signs of feline leukemia virus come from the blood cells being attacked. Initially, cats may show little signs of infection until the virus has strengthened and taken over more of their immune system. Over time, clinical signs may become more involved as cats develop cancers secondary to the leukemia virus.

The most common clinical signs of feline leukemia virus are:


	
	Pale gums (anemia)
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Unthrifty coat (poorly groomed, dry, brittle)
	
	
	Inflamed gums and mouth (gingivitis and stomatitis) 
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes

	Chronic skin, eye, respiratory, or urinary tract infections
	


"
455,Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in Cats," of Feline Infectious Peritonitis
A variety of symptoms can be seen in cats with FIP, depending on which organ system is affected. FIP can affect the liver, kidneys, pancreas, or other organ systems. 

Most cats will start showing symptoms of simply not feeling well—eating poorly, running a fever, or acting lethargic. Some animals will develop other diseases, depending on the type of the disease present. There are two main forms of FIP: 


	
	Wet (or effusive) form: Causes bloating and swelling in the abdomen (ascites) and may affect the heart and lungs. Cats with this form may pant and act sleepy or lethargic. 
	
	
	Dry (or non-effusive) form: Usually affects the eyes and may have neurological symptoms such as trouble with balance and seizures. 
	


These forms are mainly used for diagnostic purposes, and one cat may show symptoms from both forms. 

Because the symptoms associated with FIP are extremely varied and variable, it can be very hard to diagnose FIP based on clinical signs alone. Conditions that have similar symptoms include abdominal tumors, toxoplasmosis, infection with mycobacterium, and other conditions.

"
456,Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) in Cats," of Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
Common symptoms of FIC may include:  


	
	Straining to urinate 
	
	
	Urinating more often (more frequent trips to the litter box) 
	
	
	Urinating smaller amounts more frequently 
	
	
	Blood in the urine 
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box, especially on cool, smooth surfaces such as tile or hardwood floors 
	



	
	Licking excessively at the genital region 
	
	
	Crying out or meowing while urinating 
	
	
	Lack of energy 
	
	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Vomiting or diarrhea 
	



	
	Decreased social interaction (hiding) 
	


If your cat’s urethra (the tube through which urine leaves the body) has become obstructed (blocked), they will produce little to no urine and cry out often. They also will likely exhibit many of the other signs listed above. This is a medical emergency. Please seek veterinary care immediately.

"
458,Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome (Twitchy Cat Syndrome)," of Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
A cat with feline hyperesthesia syndrome typically has intermittent bursts or episodes of signs lasting 20–30 seconds. During these episodes, you may observe any of the following symptoms:


	
	Rippling or twitching of skin on the lower back (both after touch and for no apparent reason)
	
	
	Dilated pupils
	
	
	Brief bursts of jumping and running, as if startled
	
	
	Excessive meowing and other noises
	
	
	Tail-chasing
	
	
	Biting or licking the lower back, sides, hind paws, rear, or tail
	
	
	Pain or discomfort when petted or touched
	
	
	Tiredness
	


If you touch your cat during an FHS episode, you could make the signs worse, and your cat might become aggressive. Your cat will not have control over this.

If you notice your cat’s back twitching or any of the other signs listed above, it’s best to stay calm and try not to handle your cat during an episode, even though the signs can be severe and even frightening.

Causes of Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
Nobody knows what causes feline hyperesthesia syndrome. Because different cats with hyperesthesia respond to different types of treatment, there may be multiple underlying causes. In some cats, feline hyperesthesia syndrome is diagnosed along with another underlying condition.

Causes of feline hyperesthesia syndrome are usually considered dermatological (skin problems), neurological (problems with the nervous system), or psychological (mental health problems). Each of these may have different triggers for FHS episodes.

Dermatological Causes of FHS


	
	Allergies

	Loss of hair 
	


"
460,Feline Foamy Virus Infection in Cats," and Types

Most FeFV-positive cats are asymptomatic and in good health. However, some experts suggest that the infection is linked with myeloproliferative disease and chronic progressive polyarthritis, possibly due to the high likelihood of co-infection with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In these cases, the cat will demonstrate swollen joints, abnormal gait, and enlarged lymph nodes.

465,Fatty Layer or Nodule Under the Skin in Cats," and Types

Most cats have a single nodular lesion on the trunk that vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The nodule, which is either firm or soft, is freely movable underneath the skin until fully grown. In some cases, yellow-brown to bloody discharge is excreted from the nodule, while the outer skin may turn red, brown, or yellow in color. The area may be extremely sensitive, especially immediately after rupturing. After the ulcers heal, a scar or crusty layer of skin may form.

"
466,False Pregnancy in Cats," of False Pregnancy in Cats 
Cats rarely show signs of a false pregnancy. However, breeding cats frequently experience false pregnancies, which are considered normal in the breeding process.

Because most female pet cats in North America are spayed at a young age, a typical indoor cat is unlikely to experience a false pregnancy. Barn or community cats are the most likely to experience this condition. If you let your unspayed female cat go outdoors, she is at risk of becoming pregnant.

When a false pregnancy occurs, a cat’s symptoms mimic those of a true pregnancy. False pregnancy symptoms in cats include:


	
	Weight gain

"
476,Excess Protein in Cat Urine (Proteinuria in Cats)," of Proteinuria in Cats
There are usually no clinical signs of proteinuria in cats. It is often diagnosed during routine, annual health examinations, where bloodwork and urine samples are routinely tested. Symptoms are usually the result of the underlying cause of the proteinuria and not the proteinuria itself.

If symptoms are present, they may include:


	
	Blood in the urine
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	Frequent, small urinations

"
488,Excess Alkali in the Blood in Cats," and Types

Symptoms are generally related to the underlying cause of the metabolic alkalosis. The general symptoms related to metabolic alkalosis include:


    Weakness
    Irregular heartbeats

"
489,Excess Acidity in the Blood of Cats," and Types

Some common symptoms which may be observed include:


    Fever
    Panting

There are two primary RTA types: type 1 RTA (or distal), involves reduced hydrogen ion secretion in the kidney, and type 2 RTA (or proximal), which is characterized by the inability to excrete acid into the urine. Abnormal metabolic processing of bicarbonates is referred to as metabolic acidosis, and is marked by abnormally high levels of acids in the blood, and abnormally low levels of acids in the urine.

Type 2 proximal RTA occurs because of reduced bicarbonate reabsorption from the kidney. This activity causes an imbalance of acids in the blood.


"
490,Ethanol Poisoning in Cats," and Types



Symptoms will vary depending on the amount of ethanol ingested, and whether your cat's stomach was full or empty. The main symptom is a depressed central nervous system, which may develop 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion on an empty stomach, and up to two hours when ingested on a full stomach.



Other symptoms include urinating or defecating involuntarily. Higher doses of ethanol ingestion can bring about behavioral changes ranging from depression to excitement, decreased body temperature (hypothermia), slow reflexes, and flatulence if bread dough is the source of ethanol (see causes, below). Signs of advanced ethanol poisoning include depression, slowed breathing and heart rate, an increase in total body acid (metabolic acidosis), and heart attack. If left untreated, this can result in your cat's death.



Symptoms of ethanol poisoning may also be similar to early stages of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning.

"
495,Enlarged Spleen in Cats," of an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
The symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats aren’t specific to the condition. This means they could indicate a whole host of different things, and splenomegaly based on these symptoms alone is not enough for a diagnosis.

 Symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats include:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Bloated abdomen
	
	
	Abdominal pain

Splenomegaly often occurs secondary to another condition, such as an infection. In these cases, your cat may have other symptoms that depend on the underlying cause.

For example, a cat with an infectious cause might also have a fever, and a cat with an autoimmune cause like immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) might also have pale or jaundiced gums.

Causes of an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
"
496,Enlarged Liver in Cats," and Types



Kittens normally have larger livers in regard to their actual body mass, as compared to adult cats. However, hepatomegaly is most commonly diagnosed in older cats. Depending on the underlying cause, the enlargement may involve the whole liver or only part of the liver. For example, infections and/or inflammation may lead to a generalized symmetrical enlargement of the liver, whereas tumors, hemorrhages, cysts, or rotation of the liver lobe may lead to asymmetrical or focal enlargement. That is, only a part of the liver may be enlarged.



Symptoms can vary depending on the cause. Enlargement of the abdomen is the most commonly observed symptom. On examination your veterinarian will find an enlarged liver or a palpable mass in the abdominal area. The mass is usually observed behind the rib cage and may even be visible with naked eye. However, in obese animals it is difficult to detect an enlarged liver on physical examination.

Causes of Diabetes Insipidus in Cats
There are two main causes for diabetes insipidus in cats which may be treatable, depending on the cause.

Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): A condition that occurs when the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, does not secrete enough ADH, or the pituitary gland is unable to store it properly. Cats with CDI tend to be middle-aged and senior pets. 

Central diabetes insipidus in cats can be caused by a congenital defect, head trauma (such as a car accident or injury), cancer within a specific part of the brain or for reasons unknown.

Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI): A condition that occurs when the kidneys cannot respond appropriately to the ADH secreted by the brain.

Acquired NDI in cats has many causes, and there is no known breed, age, or gender predisposition to secondary NDI. "
516,Diabetes in Dogs and Cats: Everything You Need to Know,"


	Drinking and urinating much more frequently. The presence of glucose in the urine prevents the kidneys from effectively doing their job re-absorbing water into the bloodstream.
	Increased hunger. Despite the high levels of glucose in the blood, the body can’t utilize it for energy. It’s kind of like sitting at a buffet with your mouth taped shut; there’s food everywhere, but it’s not doing you any good. So the body continues to signal pets to eat more and more to raise blood glucose levels.
	Weight loss. Again, despite the increased appetite, the body can’t do anything with the calories being swallowed, so patients lose weight.
	Additional signs may include vomiting, poor coat condition, cataracts in dogs, and abnormal gait in cats.

518,Destruction of the Pituitary Gland in Cats,"

The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are  lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit. For  example, lack of luteinizing hormones can result in sexual  abnormalities such as abnormally small genitals, and GH deficiency can result in lack of appropriate  growth or dwarfism (typically developed within the first two to three months). If the gland is being affected by cancer or tumor, the cat may  be experiencing pain in its head (with consequential head-pressing), or  visual problems. Other common symptoms include:


    Mental retardation manifested as difficulty in house-breaking
    Thin, hypotonic skin – having less than normal tone or tension, as of the muscles or arteries
    Hair loss on the trunk (alopecia)
    Cutaneous hyperpigmentation – darkening of an area of the skin
    Delayed dental eruption
    Head-pressing due to pain in the head from a tumor

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need to rule out other causes for the colitis. there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. "

"
544,Coccidioidomycosis in Cats," of Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
Clinical signs tend to develop within a few weeks after spores are inhaled into the lungs. If the fungal spores escape the lungs and travel throughout the body, it can take several months after the initial cough for other signs to develop. Sometimes the initial cough can be mild, and infection can go undetected until the animal is very ill.

Other areas of the body commonly affected in cats with disseminated coccidioidomycosis are the skin, muscles, bones, brain, spinal cord, and eyes. It’s very important to have your cat examined by their veterinarian at the first sign of any illness or abnormality, even if it does not seem significant at the time. A cough in cats should always be taken seriously, as it can be an indication of a medical emergency.


	
	Early signs:

"
545,Coccidia in Cats," of Coccidia in Cats
An infection with coccidia does not always mean an illness is present. Many cats will eliminate the parasite on their own while others may shed oocysts in their stool without ever showing symptoms (asymptomatic). When illness (coccidiosis) does occur, it is often in young kittens or older cats with poor immune systems. 

As the life cycle of these parasites occurs in the intestines, signs of illness are related to the digestive system. Diarrhea is most common and may be associated with weight loss. Cats can become dehydrated (especially young kittens), and reluctant to engage in normal, playful behaviors. Only in rare cases will there be vomiting and loss of appetite. These symptoms may be aggravated by stressful environmental changes like adoption, weaning, or living in an animal shelter.

548,Clotting Deficiency (Inherited)) in Cats," and Types
 
Symptoms of coagulation factor deficiency can include prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, an obvious external symptom. Some of the less obvious symptoms that can be indicative of a coagulation deficiency are related to blood loss anemia and internal bleeding. With blood loss anemia, symptoms can present as weakness, lethargy, short breath, irregular heart beat, confusion, and a condition known medically as pica -- a compulsive eating behavior that is often intended to balance a lack of minerals or vitamins in the blood; in this case, iron deficiency from loss of blood. The animal will crave and eat non-food items, such as stones, dirt, and feces, amongst other things.

564,Cat Tooth Abscess," of a Cat Tooth Abscess
Many cats with fractured teeth have no obvious symptoms and fractured teeth are found in a routine veterinary exam. 

The following symptoms may occur for a cat with a tooth abscess: 


	
	Facial swelling 
	
	
	Dropping of food while eating 
	
	
	Difficulty picking up food 
	



	
	Preferring soft food over kibble 
	


"
566,Cat Skin Allergies,"

	Ulcers and open sores
	
	
	Intense itchiness, which will appear as frequent scratching or overgrooming
	


"
567,Cat Scratch Fever in Cats," of Cat Scratch Fever
Most cats with cat scratch fever are asymptomatic, meaning they have no clinical signs and appear normal. Very rarely, a cat may have signs of disease, including:


	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Transient fever, lethargy, and/or anorexia
	
	
	Reproductive failure
	
	
	Bacterial heart infection
	


Remember, most cats with cat scratch fever are not sick and do not show signs of disease. Humans, on the other hand, more frequently manifest symptoms of cat scratch fever. These are the most commonly reported:


	
	Pustule on the site of the scratch
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	


"
568,Cats and Motion Sickness," and Types

 

Cats show their uneasiness in various ways. The first signs of motion sickness may be:

 


	Excessive drooling (ptyalism)
	Crying out in distress
	Immobility, or acting afraid to move
	Vomiting or regurgitation
	Urinating or defecating


 

"
570,Cat Mammary Gland Tumors," of Cat Mammary Gland Tumors
The most common symptom of a cat mammary gland tumor is a lump or swelling along the cat’s mammary chain, which is the line of breast tissue and nipples along your cat’s belly.

The mass may be soft or firm, widespread or clearly defined. You may also see ulceration (sores) as well as discharge from the nipples.

In cases of metastasis, where the tumor has spread, you may see other signs of illness, such as difficulty breathing when cancer is also in the lungs. Your vet may also see lymph node swelling.

In the later stages of malignant disease, cats lose weight, and a weakened immune system can lead to systemic infections. 

"
571,Cat Lipomas," of Cat Lipomas
Although only one mass may be present, cats that do develop lipomas will often develop more than one.

The lesion is most likely found on a cat’s chest, abdomen, neck, back, and upper legs, though no location is off limits. They are found most often in the subcutaneous tissues beneath the skin, though they can grow on internal organs as well.

To the touch, lipomas in cats are most often soft and somewhat moveable, but they can also be firmer and more adhered to the nearby tissues.

They should be the same temperature as the nearby skin, and the skin above them should appear normal and without lesions.

When they grow quite large, which happens less in cats than dogs, they can outgrow their blood supply and become necrotic (tissue death).

"
572,Cat Flu," and Types



Symptoms may range from very mild to extremely severe and some infected cats may show no signs of disease at all.



The most common symptoms seen include:




	Coughing
	Sneezing
	Lethargy
	Lack of appetite
	Runny eyes
	Runny nose
	Fever
	Labored breathing




Some cats infected with H1N1 influenza have not survived, but the majority of infected cats suffer mild to moderate symptoms.



"
573,Cat Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI in Cats)," of Cat EPI
A study published in 2016 details the most common symptoms of cat EPI and the percentages of cats in the study that showed these symptoms1:


	
	Weight loss (91%)
	
	
	Unformed feces (62%)
	
	
	Poor hair coat (50%)
	
	
	Anorexia (45%)
	
	
	Increased appetite (42%)
	
	
	Lethargy (40%)
	
	
	Watery diarrhea (28%)
	
	
	Vomiting (19%)
	


The frequency of these symptoms is somewhat different than what we’ve seen in the past and what is commonly seen in EPI in dogs.

The same study also found that most cats (58%) suffered from at least one other health problem in addition to EPI. When this is the case, additional symptoms are also possible. For example, a cat with both EPI and diabetes mellitus could lose weight, have soft stools, and drink and urinate more than normal.

"
574,Cat Ear Infections," of Cat Ear Infections
Cats with ear infections may experience differences in severity and length of infection. Most often, cats will have these symptoms:


	
	Head shaking
	
	
	Scratching the ears
	
	
	Head tilt
	
	
	Ear discharge and odor
	
	
	Swollen, red, and possibly ulcerated (having sores) pinna
	
	
	Ear pain
	


Depending on the cause, ear infections may affect one or both ears. It is more common for both ears to be affected.

As the infection and inflammation progress to the inner and middle ears, cats may show signs of incoordination and vestibular issues. The vestibular system is involved in balance, motion, and orientation. Problems with the vestibular system are similar to vertigo in humans. They may also injure the pinna to the point of developing an ear hematoma (pool of blood).

"
575,Cat Ear Hematoma," of Cat Ear Hematoma
Hematomas usually appear on the underside of the ear. These fluid-filled sacs can be small—just a few millimeters—or involve the entire ear. Frequently, only one ear is affected. The swelling is soft, movable, and compressible, and may be red or painful to the touch.

Cats with ear hematomas may display the following clinical signs:


	Head shaking
	
	
	Scratching at the ears
	
	
	Head tilt
	
	
	Ear pain
	
	
	Ear discharge and odor
	
	
	Dirty, inflamed ear canals
	
	
	Swollen, red, and ulcerated pinna

"
576,Cat Constipation: Symptoms and Causes,"
Symptoms that your cat is constipated may include:


	
	Little to no fecal production while attempting to poop. This is otherwise known as straining and is often a sign of pain or discomfort.
	
	
	Frequent visits to the litter box. With constipation, cats will often have a sense of urgency to try and have a bowel movement often hence they will frequent the litter box more than usual.
	
	
	Vomiting. Vomiting can occur from a sense of feeling full due to extra feces present in the digestive tract. It can also be caused by nausea from upset stomach or abdominal pain.
	
	
	Decreased appetite. Constipation is often uncomfortable and can cause nausea, thus cats will choose not to eat to help relieve themselves or to tell you they are not feeling well.
	
	
	Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is caused by the excessive amount of stool, gas, and distension caused by constipation. Constipation can also cause an intestinal blockage which is often painful.
	
	
	Decreased energy. Abdominal pain and gas causing pain can also contribute to less activity.
	
	
	Decreased interest in interacting with family. This is a common general symptom that occurs when a cat is not feeling well. Cats often isolate themselves to try and resolve their issue or as a way of telling you they do not feel well.
	


What "
577,Cat Colds," of Cat Colds
Cats with colds may have symptoms including coughing, sneezing, discharge from the eyes or nose, lethargy, and sometimes fever. For many cats, these symptoms are will go away on their own in about 7-10 days.

However, some cats may experience complications, such as a secondary bacterial infection or pneumonia. This can cause yellow-green discharge from the eyes or nose, which may lead to congestion severe enough that your cat can’t smell or taste. Cats with this condition may refuse to eat. 

"
578,Cat Asthma," of Cat Asthma
The most common signs include:  


	
	Coughing, which can look like gagging or vomiting

	Pain around the chin
	


"
581,Cat Abscesses," of a Cat Abscess
The first and most obvious symptom of many abscesses is the actual wound, whether it’s a bite mark, a puncture wound, or a claw mark. You may also see matted hair around the wound. The matting is caused by pus oozing from the abscess.

Symptoms of a cat abscess include:


	
	Swelling
	
	
	Pain
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	A foul-smelling discharge or pus (with or without blood)

        Localized 		swelling
    
    

 
"
583,Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats," of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Symptoms of arrhythmias can be difficult for pet parents to see, and many cats will have no obvious clinical signs. Unfortunately, in some cases of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, no symptoms are seen until sudden death occurs.

Subtle changes that can be seen are a decreased appetite and your cat sleeping more. These signs may come and go if the arrhythmia is not constant.

You may also want to look out for symptoms of disease that can lead to arrhythmias. Weight loss, increased thirst, or vomiting should prompt an evaluation of your kitty for hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and intestinal disease.

Symptoms of severe cardiac arrhythmias in cats include:


	
	Syncope (fainting)
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	
	
	Abdominal distension
	


If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital immediately.

"
584,Cardiac Arrest in Cats," and Types

Blood circulation may remain intact if the animal resumes breathing within four minutes of the initial problem. However, if it lasts longer than six minutes it can lead to cardiac arrest. Common symptoms associated with this emergency include:


    Dilated pupils
    Spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope)
    Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
    Heavy breathing (dyspnea) and gasping
    Hypothermia
    Lack of response to stimulation


"
585,Carcinoid Cancer in Cats," and Types

Primary carcinoid tumors are usually found in the stomach, small intestine, liver, and heart. The general clinical symptoms of carcinoid tumors include anorexia, vomiting, dyschezia, weight loss due to liver failure, and heart disease.

	An urge to lick or scratch the affected part of their body, which may further damage their skin.
	


In severe cases, blisters or sores may develop, which can lead to infection.

If your cat is showing any of these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately. Fortunately, sunburns are rare in cats, However, signs of sunburn often look like other underlying conditions, so it’s important to get your cat checked out if you notice any of those listed above.
"
594,Calicivirus in Cats," of Calicivirus in Cats
Some cats become infected and do not show any clinical signs. If there are signs, they can range from mild to severe, with severe signs resulting in death. The most common signs are: 


	
	Sneezing 
	
	
	Nasal discharge 
	
	
	Ulceration of the surface of the nose (skin broken open)

"
595,Calcium Deposits in the Urinary Tract in Cats," and Types

Although it is rare in cats, the most common symptom of urolithiasis is straining while the animal is urinating. If there is inflammation in the urinary tract, the cat may have an enlarged belly or the area surrounding the urinary region may be noticeably irritated. If the calcium deposits are large, they can sometimes be felt through the skin by a veterinarian.

"
596,Calcium Buildup in Lungs of Cats," and Types

Cats with pulmonary mineralization may display no symptoms at all. However, some signs or symptoms that may be observed include:


    Cyanosis
    Coughing
    Shortness of breath
    High respiratory rate
    Abnormal breathing sounds
    Exercise intolerance


Calcification can be dystrophic (degenerative), which occurs secondary to tissue degeneration or inflammation, or it can be metastatic (transmissible throughout the body), which occurs secondary to metabolic disease, affecting the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy.

Calcification may also be considered a normal part of the aging process, or with particular breeds (e.g., premature calcification of the tracheal and bronchial cartilages in chondrodystrophic [dwarf] breeds). Calcification is often associated with a wound, thus most focal calcifications are functionally unimportant.

Ossification, also called heterotopic bone formation (the abnormal formation of true bone within extraskeletal soft tissues), can take different forms: calcification of a bony matrix (formative tissue), and pulmonary ossification in the form of small, multiple nodules.

Generalized pulmonary mineralizations of unknown cause are reported in cats under these descriptive terms: pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis or pumice stone lung; bronchiolar microlithiasis; idiopathic pulmonary calcification; or idiopathic pulmonary ossification.

"
597,Bulging Eyes in Cats," of Bulging Eyes in Cats

	Absent ocular reflexes
	Asymmetry to the face and sinuses
	Pain upon opening the mouth, often associated with inflamed gums and tissues in the back of the mouth
	Local lymph node enlargement

	Change in behavior: not wanting to jump, stretch, or scratch as they normally do; not grooming themselves, or growling and hissing when petted
	
	
	Decreased appetite: avoiding food may indicate a broken jaw or pain in getting to their food bowl
	
	
	Swelling or bruising
	
	
	Other injuries: cuts, scrapes, or bruises in areas where an injury may have occurred
	


"
599,Breeding Timing in Cats," and Types

In order to maximize the odds of conception with properly timed breeding, it is best to pin-point, as close as possible, the day of ovulation for the queen. Symptoms of estrus in the queen are evident by her rubbing against objects, being vocal (much more than usual), and an interest shown by the male cat. However, timing of breeding is less critical with cats and ultimately depends on the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) released, which is triggered via stimulation of the queen’s vagina and cervix.

    Loss 	of conscious proprioception (i.e., clumsy misplacement of feet, 	tripping, etc.)
    Cranial 	nerve abnormalities
    Paralysis


"
603,Brain Injury in Cats," and Types



Being that it is a vital organ, the brain requires constant supply of oxygen and nutrition. Any deficiency of oxygen or direct trauma to the brain, therefore, may result in bleeding and fluid buildup, which can cause excessive pressure on the brain. This in turn can cause complications involving the heart, eye, and several other body systems. Symptoms vary and depend on the cause and severity of the brain injury. Some of the more common symptoms include:




	Seizures
	Loss of consciousness
	Abnormal posture or irregular movements
	Ear or nose bleed
	Bleeding inside the eye (involving the retina)
	Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
	Insufficient oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia)
	Purplish or bluish patch under the mucous membranes) or under the skin due to ruptured blood vessels (ecchymosis)
	Red or purple spot on the body caused by a minor hemorrhage (petechiation)
	Heavy or rapid breathing (dyspnea or tachypnea, respectively)
	Abnormal heart functions, such as abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)




"
604,Brain Inflammation Due to Parasitic Infection in Cats," and Types

Symptoms associated with this type of encephalitis will vary depending on the portion of CNS affected.

Acute symptoms of a reaction to blood transfusion may include fever, vomiting, weakness, incontinence, shock, collapse, and general loss of transfusion effectiveness. Symptoms of a delayed reaction are usually not directly apparent and result only in a loss of the transfusion’s effectiveness.
 
Many symptoms will vary, depending on the exact cause. Transfusion of contaminated blood can result in fever, shock, and septicemia -- an invasion of disease producing bacteria into the bloodstream. Circulatory overload resulting from rapid or excessive transfusion can result in vomiting, cough, and heart failure. Hypothermia, which can stem from transfusion of cold refrigerated blood -- usually in smaller cats or already hypothermic cats -- is evident by shivering and impaired platelet function.
 
"
615,Blood Thickening in Cats," and Types
 
The following symptoms gradually appear but run a chronic course:
 

    Weakness
    Depression
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Redness of skin (erythema)
    Increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria)

 
"
616,Blood Related Deficiencies in Cats," and Types

 

The symptoms that develop in the patient depend largely on the underlying cause leading to pancytopenia. Some symptoms of leucopenia (low white-blood cell count) include repeated episodes of fever, and frequent or persistent infections. Some symptoms of anemia due to low red-blood cell count include sluggishness and pale gums.

 

Low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia may lead to tiny pinpoint bruises on the body, referred to as petechial hemorrhate, or bleeding from the moist tissues of the body, known as mucosal bleeding.

 

Other general symptoms may include lethargy, bleeding (i.e., nose bleeds or blood in the urine), and fever.

Symptoms of nocardiosis are largely dependent on the site of infection. If, for example, it occurs in the pleural body cavity, which includes the lungs and surrounding membranes, symptoms can include emaciation, fever, and raspy, labored breathing (dyspnea). If it is a skin infection, symptoms can include the presence of chronic non-healing wounds and, if left untreated, draining lymph nodes. If the infection is not localized in one specific area of the body (also known as disseminated), the symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and lethargic behavior.

"
637,"Bacterial Infection (Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Acoleplasma) in Cats"," and Types



Symptoms of mycoplasmosis includes simultaneous inflammation of several joints (known as polyarthritis), such as the knees, ankles, hips, or shoulders, and inflammation of tendon sheaths. Long-term lameness, difficulty moving, fever, and general signs of discomfort are some of the typical signs. Other signs may include squinting or spasmodic blinking, fluid-buildup in the eyes, reddened eyes, discharge from the eyes, or conjunctivitis, a condition in which the moist tissue of the eye becomes inflamed. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild, with sneezing being the main complaint.



In cats, further signs related to the site of infection may include long term abscesses on the surface of the body/skin. Infections in the respiratory system, or urinary and genital tract infections, are also common. Feline pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, are some of the conditions that may be present. Because of the genital to reproductive system proximity of this bacterial parasite, pregnancy related problems are a common finding. Weak newborns, stillbirths, early death of newborns, or death while in embryo are some of the more severe repercussions.

	Anemia and secondary bruising, which may be noticed as pale gums, bloody stool, and/or a bloody nose
	
	
	Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums)
	
	
	Fever (not as commonly reported)
	


In addition to the above symptoms, you may notice irritation, redness, and itching around the bite site.

Because babesiosis is transmitted through tick bites, be sure to check your cat thoroughly for ticks that are visible to the naked eye; usually the size of a tack or smaller, often darker in color, and have several pairs of legs. The most common areas ticks are found on a cat include the head, ears, neck, feet, and rear.  

"
644,Ataxia in Cats (Loss of Balance in Cats)," of Ataxia in Cats
An ataxic cat may look like they are drunk, with a wobbly gait, swaying, and increased drowsiness. They may also have more subtle symptoms, such as a mild head tilt or a curling under of the toes while walking.  

Cats suffering from ataxia may also have an abnormal eye movement called nystagmus, which is caused by an underlying issue with the central nervous system.  

Cats that suddenly become ataxic often roll or fall to one side and have significant nausea due to feeling so unsteady. Cats with chronic ataxia have generally adjusted over time and are less likely to be nauseated. 

Causes of Ataxia in Cats
There is a long list of possible causes of ataxia, depending on whether the condition is vestibular, sensory, or cerebellar. Sometimes a cause cannot be determined even with extensive testing, but it is very important to rule out as many causes as possible so your vet can create a treatment plan. 

Causes of vestibular ataxia in cats include:  


	
	Infection, especially feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or fungal infection 
	
	
	Inflammatory/immune-mediated causes 
	



	
	Toxicity 
	
	
	Middle or inner ear infection 
	
	
	Metabolic 
	
	
	Cancer, polyp, or tumor 
	
	
	Trauma  
	



	
	Idiopathic (unknown cause) vestibular disease 
	


Causes of sensory ataxia in cats:  


	
	Degeneration (breaking down) of the spinal cords and nerves over time 
	
	
	Loss of blood flow to an area of the spinal cord because of a stroke-like event, or a bleeding blood vessel causing a buildup of blood to compress the spinal cord 
	
	
	Birth defects causing the spine or vertebrae to be malformed  
	



	
	Compression/damage to the spinal cord caused by a tumor, a pocket of infection (abscess), or trauma, which can lead to swelling and bleeding in the spinal canal 
	


"
645,Aspirin Poisoning in Cats," and Types of Cat Aspirin Toxicity

The progression of symptoms can occur quickly. Frequently, one of the first noticeable signs is loss of appetite.

Other signs of aspirin toxicity in cats include vomiting and diarrhea, brought on by ulceration in the stomach and small intestines. The vomit or diarrhea may have fresh blood (red) or digested blood (dark brown to black) in it.

The central nervous system may also be affected, causing your cat to have trouble walking, appear weak and uncoordinated, or even collapse. Loss of consciousness and sudden death can also occur.

Even dosed at the appropriate amount, aspirin for cats can produce these symptoms, therefore it is imperative for you to monitor your cat for any digestive problems or changes in behavior when giving aspirin that is prescribed by a veterinarian.

If a significant amount of aspirin is ingested, emergency medical treatment will be necessary.

"
646,Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats," of Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats

"
647,Ascites in Cats," of Ascites in Cats
The amount of fluid in the abdomen influences the development of symptoms. When the amount of fluid is relatively small, there may be no symptoms and X-rays are needed to diagnose ascites accurately. The buildup of large amounts of fluid in the abdomen may cause cats to develop noticeable symptoms, including the most common:


	
	Abdominal discomfort—cats resist abdomen examination or vocalize while lying down
	
	
	Abdominal swelling
	
	
	Trouble breathing (such as increased breathing rate and increased effort) and decreased ability to engage in physical activity
	
	
	Decreased appetite

	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Heart murmur and weak pulse, if heart failure is the cause
	


"
648,Arthritis in Cats," of Arthritis in Cats
Some cats with arthritis may not show any obvious signs—they can be very good at hiding their pain! Some obvious signs of arthritis include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting.

However, cats may display arthritis differently, and make it difficult for owners to recognize. Some cats may become hesitant to jump or play like when they were younger. They may have decreased energy or agility falling when they attempt to jump up or down on surfaces.

It may be difficult for them to move their body without pain to groom, so cats may be more unkempt. Some pet parents note changes in posture, such as not sleeping or sitting normally. If arthritis causes pain when they use the litter box, they may associate the litter box as the cause of the pain and start eliminating outside it. It is important to note that these changes do not occur overnight and usually happen gradually.

"
652,Anxiety Disorders in Cats," of Anxiety Disorders in Cats
The symptoms a cat has of an anxiety disorder can depend on what is causing the anxiety. Cats who have separation anxiety, for example, may be extremely clingy and become agitated when they anticipate their favorite pet parent’s imminent departure. But there are also a variety of possible generalized signs when cats feel anxious.

Other feline anxiety disorder signs can include:


	
	Body language changes—Your cat can’t speak, but they can tell you how they are feeling through their body language. Signs that indicate your whiskered friend is anxious include keeping their tail close to their body, avoiding eye contact, having dilated pupils, flicking their tail, staring, or holding their ears back.
	
	
	Hiding or escaping—When threatened, many cats hide, and they may scratch or chew on doors or windows if they feel trapped.
	
	
	Inappropriate urination—Anxious cats often avoid their litter box.
	
	
	Overgrooming—Self-licking calms cats, and an anxious cat may groom excessively, in some cases causing hair loss or wounds at the grooming site.
	
	
	Excessive vocalization—Cats often meow to get your attention, but anxious cats often meow excessively and typically in a different tone than their usual meow.
	
	
	Appetite changes—As in humans, anxiety can cause your feline friend to eat less or more than usual.
	
	
	Gastrointestinal (GI) issues—Some anxious cats experience GI issues such as vomiting or diarrhea.
	
	
	Reactivity—Anxiety may make your cat act reactively toward you or other pets or people in your home.

Allergies are extremely common in cats and it’s typically a life-long condition that can impact the cat and pet parent’s quality of life. While some breeds may be more prone to allergies, they can occur in all cats. Early intervention is critical to long-term success. As soon as you notice your cat may be suffering from allergies, call your veterinarian for an exam.

Symptoms of Allergies in Cats
All types of allergies can cause similar, overlapping clinical signs in cats. These symptoms vary in intensity and may develop over years.

Food Allergy

Food allergies can look very similar to environmental allergies. Not all cats with a food allergy will have gastrointestinal signs like vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, and hypersalivation. Many will have skin symptoms, including itchiness, especially around the face, head, and neck. Food allergies are typically non-seasonal, meaning they occur all year round.

Atopic Dermatitis

Atopy, or environmental allergies, can mimic food allergies. Itchiness is the most reported clinical sign, in addition to ear infections, hair loss, skin plaques, and pustules. Often, cats have relapsing secondary bacterial and yeast infections. Atopy can also cause asthma-like respiratory issues, and conjunctivitis.

Flea Allergy Dermatitis

Flea allergies only affect the skin. Historically, cats with flea allergies either have poor or no flea control.   The head and neck are most often affected, as well as the inner thighs and abdomen. Often, cats have intense itching resulting in self-induced trauma from itching, chewing, and rubbing to relieve the itch.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Allergic contact dermatitis occurs as lesions on the skin after exposure to a certain trigger such as pollen, yeast, or mites. The location is determined by direct contact. Most cats with contact dermatitis show redness, swelling, pustules, and crusts at the site of exposure. Itching at these locations may be moderate or severe.

Cutaneous Drug Eruptions

Cutaneous drug eruptions are allergic reactions to any type of drug. They vary in clinical signs, location, and severity. Cats most often experience itchiness, rashes, redness, swelling, inflammation, hives, and in severe cases, cellular death and sloughing of the skin in sheets. This type of allergy is uncommon in cats.

Allergic Bronchitis

Allergic bronchitis is also known as asthma. Cats will typically wheeze, cough, and have labored breathing.

"
674,Acid Reflux in Cats," and Types



Gastroesophageal reflux can cause esophagitis with varying amounts of damage. Mild esophagitis is limited to a mild inflammation of the esophageal lining, while more severe ulcerative esophagitis causes damage to the deeper layers of the esophagus.



Your cat's behavioral history can reveal symptoms such as spitting up (regurgitation) of food, evidence of pain (mewling or howling, for example) while swallowing, lack of appetite, and weight loss. A physical exam will often not reveal any concrete findings. Severe esophagitis may include symptoms of fever and extreme salivation.



"
675,Accumulation of Air Between Chest and Lungs in Cats," and Types

There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

Traumatic pneumothorax, which occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and is due to some sort of trauma, such as a car accident, may be evident by the signs of shock.

Cats with spontaneous pneumothorax, on the other hand, may show sings of lung disease. Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease).

Open pneumothorax occurs when there is a defect located in the respiratory system, such as a puncture in the chest wall, resulting in contact between the pleural space and the outside atmosphere; closed pneumothorax, meanwhile, is identified as pneumothorax without any respiratory defects.

Traumatic pneumothorax is generally open, while spontaneous pneumothorax is always closed.

Another type of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, in which air is transferred into the pleural space during regular inhalation, becoming trapped, and creating a one-way transfer of air into the pleural space.

"
679,Abnormal Passage Between Artery and Vein in Cats," and Types

The symptoms associated with an arteriovenous fistula will ultimately depend on the size and location of the fistula. Typically, there is a warm, non-painful at the site of the fistula. If the lesion is on a limb, the cat may display:


    Swelling 	where you can touch the limb and a fingertip impression is left in 	the skin (pitting edema)
    Lameness
    Ulceration
    Scabbing
    Gangrene 	(Tissue dies and turns green)


Signs of congestive heart failure, which is often associated with this type of fistula, include:


    Coughing
    Difficulty 	breathing (dyspnea)
    Increased 	heart rate 	(tachypnea)
    Exercise 	intolerance

"
681,Abnormal Diaphragm Opening in Cats," and Types

Signs of a diaphragmatic hernia include irregular heartbeat, labored breathing (especially after a forceful blow) and symptoms of shock. The abdomen may move rapidly (palpitate) or feel empty. Reactions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating can occur because of damage to the bowel or stomach.

In congenital cases, the symptoms may not be evident immediately. Gradual symptoms include muffled heart sounds or heart murmurs, abdominal defects, and trouble breathing. Signs may occur suddenly with damage to the bowel, spleen, or liver.
