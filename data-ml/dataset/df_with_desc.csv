0,Zinc Poisoning in Cats,"Zinc Toxicity in Cats

Zinc is among the most important minerals required for maintaining a healthy cat. It is also be lethal and cause toxicity in cats when absorbed in large quantities. More commonly referred to as zinc toxicity, it occurs when a cat ingests an exorbitant amount of zinc-containing materials.

Symptoms and Types


    Lack of appetite
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Lethargy
    Depression
    Excessive hemoglobin levels in blood
    Excessive hemoglobin levels in urine
    Jaundice
    Orange colored feces


Causes

Ingestion of zinc-containing materials, such as:


    Nuts
    Bolts
    Staples
    Nails
    Board game pieces
    Zippers
    Some toys
    Jewelry
    Pennies
    Certain lozenge brands
    Some lotions


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your cat, including any incident of ingestion of unusual materials which may have precipitated the symptoms. He or she will also perform a complete physical examination on the animal. Routine laboratory tests include biochemistry profile, electrolytes, urinalysis, and a complete blood count. The complete blood count may reveal anemia due to zinc-related destructions of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) with possible formation of Heinz bodies, or granules present in the red blood cells. The complete blood count may also reveal variations in red blood cells coloration known as polychromasia.

The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may reveal abnormally high levels of hemoglobin and bilirubin in blood. If biochemistry profile shows derangements -- like high levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes -- it will indicate multiple organ failure, which is not a good sign.

While examining your cat's blood, the veterinarian may also note abnormal red blood cells with an unusual dark ring surrounding a dark center known as target cells; this is associated with anemia.

Due to rapid destruction of red blood cells, your veterinarian will administer a test called packed cell volume (PCV), which will calculate the number of viable red blood cells. This test is important in determining whether a blood transfusion is required.

To confirm the diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will order laboratory tests to measure the levels of zinc in your cat's blood. These tests can also help evaluate your cat's blood clotting mechanism, an indicator of zinc toxicity. In addition, X-rays are often used to confirm if your cat has ingested zinc-containing materials.

Treatment

To prevent further damage, removal of the object is imperative. To maintain the bodily fluid levels as well as promote urination, intravenous fluid therapy is initiated. Drugs to lower the stomach acidity and promote the release of zinc will also be instituted. In case of severe red blood destruction, blood transfusions may be required.

Living and Management

Prompt treatment is crucial in saving the life of a cat with zinc toxicity. Subsequent check-ups will be required to monitor the health of the patient and to evaluate the progress of therapy through laboratory testing.

Often, the levels of zinc in the blood drop quickly once the source is removed. However, cats with severe complications like multiple organ failure have poor chances of survival."," and Types

1,Zinc Phosphide Poisoning in Cats,"Rat Poison Toxicity

Many people use commercial poisons to kill rodents, roaches and other common house hold pests. In order to be appealing to the pests they are aimed at, some poisons are made to taste good, making them appealing to dogs and cats as well.

Poisoning by pesticides and rodenticides is one of the most common household dangers to your cat. In this case, zinc phosphide poisoning will be explored as a potential culprit for your cat's health condition. Zinc phosphide is an ingredient used in some rat poisons, and is also commonly used by pest control professionals. One of the ways in which zinc phosphide effects the body is by causing a release of gases in the stomach, so that an animal that has ingested poison containing zinc phosphide will have breath smelling of garlic or rotten fish. Treatment is symptomatic (based on symptoms), and side effects of zinc phosphide poisoning can linger for several days after treatment.

Symptoms


    Garlic or rotten fish odor in breath (with no recent history of eating either of these foods)
    Rapid and/or difficult breathing
    Blood in vomit
    Depression
    Weakness
    Convulsions/seizures


Causes


    Ingestion of Poisons
    Rodent Poison
    Cockroach poison
    Pest poison
    Any poison containing zinc phosphide
    Ingestion of animal that has ingested poison (e.g., rodents)


If you suspect that your cat has come into contact with rat or mouse poison, and you are seeing some of the symptoms listed above, you will need to have your cat seen by a doctor before its health becomes critical. Keep in mind that if your cat goes out of doors at all there is the possibility that it will come into contact with rodent poison. The poison might be in a neighbor's yard, in a trash bag, in an alleyway, or the poison might have been ingested by a rat or mouse that your cat has caught and ingested parts from. Even if you do not live in an area where rats or mice are a concern, rodent poison may be used for other common suburban pests, like raccoons, opossums, or squirrels.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile and a urinalysis.

Treatment

If you are positive that your cat has ingested zinc phosphide through rat poison, you will need to encourage vomiting to expel the poison. For immediate first aid, try to induce vomiting with a simple hydrogen peroxide solution of one teaspoon per five pounds of body weight – with no more than three teaspoons given at once. This method should only be used if the toxin has been ingested in the previous two hours, and should only be given three times, spaced apart at ten minute intervals. If your cat has not vomited after the third dose, do not use it, or anything further, to try to induce vomiting. Induced vomiting can be dangerous with some toxins, and some poisons will do more harm coming back through the esophagus than they did going down. Do not use anything stronger than hydrogen peroxide without your veterinarian's assent, and do not induce vomiting unless you are absolutely sure of what your cat has ingested. If your cat has already vomited, do not try to force more vomiting.

A final word, do not induce vomiting if your cat is unconscious, is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Whether your cat vomits or not, after the initial care you must rush it to a veterinary facility immediately.

There is no specific antidote for zinc phosphide poisoning. The most likely course your veterinarian will take is to do a lavage (an internal washing) of your cat's stomach with a five percent sodium bicarbonate solution, which will raise the gastric pH level and delay gas formation due to the swallowed zinc phosphide poison.

Living and Management

The health and survival of your cat depends on the amount of zinc phosphide poison ingested, and the time that elapses before treatment begins. Your cat may continue to suffer from symptoms of poisoning, like weakness and depression, for several days after treatment.

Prevention

The best prevention is to keep all poisons (especially rodent poisons) out of your cat's reach. Carelessly placed poisons are a potentially fatal hazard that can be easily avoided.","

2,Yellow Skin (Jaundice) in Cats,"
Jaundice (also called “icterus”) is a yellowing of the skin of cats that can be caused by a variety of medical conditions. The yellowing of the skin seen in jaundice is caused by a build-up of waste products in the bloodstream. Most commonly, these waste products are either byproducts of some type of liver disease, or they may come from the bloodstream if the red blood cells are being broken down too quickly.  

Symptoms of Jaundice in Cats 
Jaundice in cats is, by definition, yellowing of the skin. It’s most easily seen when looking at the whites of your cat’s eyes, the lightly haired area inside of the ears, or along the lips and back of the hard palate (roof) in the mouth. Most cats experiencing jaundice are also not feeling well, so they may be sluggish, not eating as much, and vomiting frequently. 

The following additional signs may appear with jaundice: 


        
        Yellowish discoloration of the skin 
        



        
        Fever 
        
        
        Abdominal pain 
        
        
        Loss of appetite (anorexia) 
        
        
        Paleness 
        
        
        Change in color of urine and feces (orange colored) 
        



        
        Increased frequency (polyuria) and volume of urine 
        
        
        Increased thirst (polydipsia) and consumption of water 
        
        
        Mental confusion in advanced cases 
        
        
        Weight loss 
        
        
        Bleeding (especially in cats with advanced liver disease) 
        


Causes of Jaundice in Cats
There are many diseases that can cause jaundice in cats. Some of these are from “intrahepatic causes,” meaning they arise from within the liver. Jaundice is also commonly caused by triaditis, or inflammation of the intestinal tract, pancreas, and liver. This condition is associated with inflammatory bowel disease in cats. 

Other causes are “extra-hepatic,” meaning they are caused by an obstruction of the ducts and outflow of bile from the liver. Some of these causes include: 


        
        Excess destruction of red blood cells, often from diseases of the bloodstream such as cytauxzoonosis (from ticks). 
        
        
        Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA), in which the body attacks its own red blood cells. 
        
        
        Tumors. 
        
        
        Buildup of excess fat in the liver. 
        
        
        Any condition that interferes with the secretion of bilirubin. 
        



        
        Gall stones in the ducts surrounding the liver (very rare) 
        


How Veterinarians Diagnose Jaundice in Cats 
In most instances, your vet will see jaundice during a physical examination. Veterinarians check the color of the sclera (the whites of the eyes) and pinnae (ears) as part of a routine physical examination. If jaundice is suspected based on the visual exam, a total bilirubin blood test will be conducted. In cats with jaundice, total bilirubin will be elevated.  

Additional blood tests will generally help the vet identify the problem with either the hepatic (liver) or bloodstream and identify an underlying cause. 

Treating Jaundice in Cats 
Treatment varies widely depending on the cause of the jaundice. In many instances, medications will be used to improve liver function (if this is the root cause) or to slow the destruction of red blood cells if the problem lies in the bloodstream. 

Recovering from Jaundice in Cats
Many animals recover quickly once the source of the jaundice is identified and a treatment plan is created. Others with more serious conditions will likely require more time to recover. Some pets with serious liver disorders can require weeks of intensive treatment to be on the mend. 
Jaundice in Cats FAQsHow long does it take for jaundice to go away? How long it will take for the jaundice to resolve depends on the underlying problem. Many cats will respond quickly to diagnosis and treatment, with the jaundice resolving within days to weeks. Some cats will have more serious conditions and may take weeks or even months to respond.   
How does a pet parent care for a cat with jaundice?Cats with liver failure need an extremely high level of care at home due to the instability of this condition. For example, cats may bleed at any time. If you notice bleeding, you should immediately call your veterinarian. In addition, if you see any changes to your cat’s feces or urine, advise your vet. 
Can jaundice in cats be cured? Depending on the underlying condition, many cases of jaundice can be readily diagnosed and cured, while some cases may take longer. Only after a complete physical exam and some diagnostic testing will your veterinarian be able to give you a prognosis and create a treatment plan.  
Is jaundice a serious condition? Jaundice in the cat is considered a serious condition and should be diagnosed and treated promptly.

3,Yeast Infection and Thrush in Cats,"Candidiasis in Cats



Candida is a type of sugar-digesting yeast that forms part of the normal flora in an animal's mouth, nose, ears, and gastrointestinal and genital tracts. Although it is a normal part of the body, this type of yeast is opportunistic and will sometimes colonize or invade the damaged tissues of immuno-suppressed animals. Left unchecked, candida can quickly grow to abnormal levels. Candidiasis is the medical condition that occurs when there is an overgrowth of candida in the body.



This type of fungal infection can afflict cats of any age and breed, even if the cat has no predisposing conditions. The infection can take place in a specific part of the body (local), or it can colonize the entire body (systemic). Either affliction is likely to cause extreme discomfort.



Symptoms



How the symptoms of candidiasis manifest depend largely on where the infection takes place. In the case of an ear infection, a common symptom is constant shaking and scratching at the head. If candida settles in the oral cavity, there will usually be an abnormal amount of drooling. If it involves the urinary bladder, your cat may experience inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). Inflammation around areas where intravenous (IV) catheters and gastronomy tubes have been inserted, skin irritation, open sores on the skin (ulcerative lesions), and correlating fever are common symptoms that these sites have been invaded by candida.



Causes



The causes and risk factors of candidiasis are numerous. Cats that have skin that has been traumatized, is damaged by burns, or that has dying and inflamed tissue (necrotizing dermatitis) carry an increased risk of acquiring the condition. The same can be said for cats which have neutropenia, a viral (parvovirus) infection, the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), or the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Existing conditions that can open the door to the candida fungus are diabetes, and urinary retention caused by narrowing of the ureter tubes (typically following a urethrostomy, an artificial opening from the urethra through the perineum to allow urine to pass). Conditions which call for indwelling catheters can also place animals at a higher risk for contracting candidiasis.



Diagnosis



The diagnostic procedure for candidiasis can be carried out in a number of ways. In case of lesions, a biopsy to confirm or dismiss diseased tissue will be conducted. The results of the biopsy will determine whether or not yeast organisms have penetrated the affected tissues. A urine sample will also be taken. The presence of candida colonies in the urine, along with a simultaneous bacterial infection in the urinary tract will point to candidiasis. The urine analysis will also show yeast forms, or clumps, of mycelial elements. If fever is also present, tips of catheters will also be cultured for both bacteria and fungi. Infected tissues will typically contain a white, cheesy foci. Tests will find large numbers of yeast organisms in inflamed tissues where candidiasis is present.







Treatment



Treatment for candidiasis involves improving and strengthening the immune system. In the case of diabetes, there is also a critical need to regulate the condition's complications and control hyperadrenocorticism. If your cat has any indwelling catheters, they must be removed. Medications that are typically used to treat candidiasis are applied to the skin or to otherwise affected areas.



Living and Management



After the symptoms of candidiasis have subsided, treatment should be continued for two more weeks, ideally. Then, a culture of the infected areas must be re-taken to determine if the condition has been resolved. Because candidiasis is often symptomatic of an underlying disease, such as diabetes, it is of utmost importance that such diseases are controlled.



Prevention



There are currently no known preventative measures.","

4,Xanthine Urinary Tract Stones in Cats,"Xanthine Urolithiasis in Cats
 
Xanthine is a natural by-product of purine metabolism, which is normally converted to uric acid (the waste product of proteins found in the blood) by the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Because xanthine is the least soluble of the purines excreted in urine, excessive amounts of xanthines in the urine may be associated with formation of xanthine uroliths (stones). Impairment of xanthine oxidase ultimately results in xanthines in the blood (hyperxanthinemia) and xanthines spilling over into the urine (xanthinuria). It may be naturally occurring, as with enzyme deficiency, or drug-induced (allopurinol). Xanthinuria can be a congenital or an acquired disease.
 
A breed predisposition has not been identified in cats, but in naturally occurring xanthinuria, a familial or congenital defect in xanthine oxidase activity is likely. Consumption of high purine diets (high protein) increases the risk of xanthinuria in patients being treated with allopurinol.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Although some cats may not display any clinical symptoms (asymptomatic), most will exhibit such signs as:

    Mustard colored urine
    Bladder stones:

    
        Frequent urination (polyuria)
        Difficulty urinating
        Bloody urine (hematuria)
    
    
    Stones in the urethra:

    
        Frequent urination
        Difficulty urinating
        Bloody urine
        Urethra may be blocked
    
    
    Kidney stones (nephroliths):

    
        Asymptomatic
        Hydronephrosis – kidney is swollen with urine due to a blocked ureter (the tube leading to the bladder from the kidney)
        Kidney disease
    
    


Causes
 

    Xanthines in the urine can lead to formation of stones
    May recur in cats not given preventative therapy
    Excessive allopurinol medication in combination with high purine diet
    Relation to urine chemistry:
    
        Acid urine pH
        Highly concentrated urine
        Incomplete and infrequent urination
    
    

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible prior conditions that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The urinalysis will show xanthine crystals in the urine sediment. 
 
These crystals cannot be distinguished  by light microscopy alone. For a precise diagnosis, the urine should be sent for infrared spectroscopy, which can be used to differentiate xanthine uroliths (urinary tract stones) from other types of uroliths. Also, high-pressure liquid chromatography of urine can be done to detect xanthine, hypoxanthine, and other purine metabolites.
 
Ultrasonography, double-contrast cystography, and intravenous urography are some additonal diagnostic tools that can aid in detecting uroliths and the location they are originating from. Uroliths generally do not show up on normal X-rays.
 
Xanthine uroliths in the urethra and bladder stones near the urethra may be detected by urethrocystoscopy, which uses a small flexible tube that is equipped with a camera and can be inserted into small spaces, in this case, the urethral passage. Small uroliths may be retrieved for analysis by removing fluid using a transurethral catheter, or using a method called voiding urohydropulsion. This latter method involves filling the bladder completely while the patient is anesthetized, and then emptying the bladder, after attempting to shake stones into the urethra, so that the stones can be collected. 
 
Treatment
 
Voiding urohydropulsion is effective for removing the smaller xanthine uroliths that will easily pass through the urethra, but surgery is still the best way to remove larger uroliths from the lower urinary tract. Perineal urethrostomy surgery may minimize recurrent urethral obstruction in male cats, but this condition is known for recurring in many cats that have been affected.
 
Urine pH may be increased to prevent xanthine uroliths, and a low-purine diet may be fed along with plenty of water to increase urine output. Depending on your cat's overall health and the severity of this condition, your veterinarian may also recommend a diet that is designed for cats suffering renal failure. The goal is to reduce the amount of ingested purine, along with reducing the formation of acid urine, in addition to increasing the amount of urine that is voided from the bladder so that the passages remain clear of stone forming chemicals.
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments for your cat in order to conduct urinalysis, contrast X-rays, or ultrasonography exams. Your cat's treatment may be adjusted to how well its health is progressing since the initial treatment. Xanthine uroliths often recur in cats."," and Types

5,Worms in Cats,"It can be alarming when you find a worm in your cat’s stool. Worms are common internal parasites that infect kittens and cats with prevalence rates as high as 45% in the United States.

Gastrointestinal (GI) worms in cats are typically not a medical emergency but can become one if a cat is infested with several worms. Tell your vet immediately if you see any worms in your cat’s stool, so they can determine the type of worm and how to treat it. It may be beneficial to send a photo to your vet or save the stool sample.

If you also notice that your cat has pale gums, is having trouble breathing, or is vomiting or not eating, take them  to the vet immediately.

Types of Worms in Cats

The most common types of worms in cats are gastrointestinal worms. They include:


        
        Roundworms—Roundworms are the most common type of intestinal worm in cats, with up to 25% of all cats being infected and even higher rates in kittens. Roundworms are 3 to 6 inches long, cream-colored, and resemble spaghetti when found in the stool.
        
        
        Hookworms—Hookworms are tiny, thin, whitish worms. They are so small (about 1/8 inch long) that most people do not notice them on the cat’s stool. If you do see them, they look like tiny, thin strings. Hookworms get their name from their hook-like mouthparts and aggressive bloodsucking behavior; they attach themselves to the lining of the intestines and suck blood.
        
        
        Whipworms—Whipworms are 2 to 3 inches in length with one thicker end and one thinner end, resembling a whip, hence their name. Whipworms are not easily seen in the stool and are diagnosed by your vet, who can identify the eggs under a microscope.
        
        
        Tapeworms—Tapeworms occur when a kitten or cat eats a flea while grooming or eats a rodent infected with tapeworm eggs. Tapeworms look like grains of rice and are found around the anus or in a cat’s stool.
        


Other worms that can affect cats include:


        
        Heartworms
        
        
        Lungworms
        
        
        Bladder worms
        
        
        Liver flukes
        


Symptoms of Worms in Cats
Symptoms of worms in cats may vary. You can usually determine the type of worm based on your cat’s symptoms:


        
        Diarrhea or soft stool; you may see worms in the stool
        
        
        Vomiting (worms may be seen in the vomit)
        
        
        Pot-bellied (distended) abdomen
        
        
        Thin body condition and weight loss
        
        
        General unhealthy appearance including dull hair coat
        
        
        Pale gums (hookworms only)
        
        
        Coughing or trouble breathing can be seen if worms migrate to the lungs (hookworms, roundworms)
        


Causes of Worms in Cats
Most kittens are infected with GI worms while nursing their mother, when they ingest tiny worm larvae directly from their mother’s milk. If you are caring for a nursing mama or pregnant cat, ask your vet about deworming her to treat her existing worms and stay ahead of transmission to the kittens.

Worms in cats typically occur when worm eggs are ingested. This can happen when a cat licks their fur after exposure to a contaminated environment or when they eat an animal infected with the worm or its eggs.

Hookworm larvae can penetrate directly into the skin between the toes, causing skin infections. Keep your cat indoors to prevent exposure to GI worms.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Worms in Cats
To diagnose worms in cats, a veterinarian will likely need a stool sample. You can bring a stool sample from home or your vet can get a sample during a physical examination of your pet.

A fecal examination, also known as a fecal floatation test, may be performed in the clinic or sent out to a reference laboratory.

Even if you can see the worms in the stool and have a good idea of what worm you are dealing with, your veterinarian will likely want to run the fecal examination to ensure the worm is correctly identified. Your vet will also check for eggs of any other worms.

Unfortunately, a cat may have several different types of worms at one time.

Treatment of Worms in Cats
Roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms are treatable with oral and topical medications, and sometimes injectable formulations, prescribed by your veterinarian.

Some worms in cats are killed with a single treatment. Other worms require multiple dosages of a medication given on a strict schedule over a certain period.

It’s important to carefully follow the directions provided by your vet and to schedule follow-up visits and tests to ensure the treatment is working for your cat.

The cost for treatment can vary depending on:


        
        The type of worm being treated
        
        
        The severity of your cat’s infection
        
        
        The medication dosage
        
        
        The frequency schedule your veterinarian recommends
        
        
        Your cat’s health status
        


Recovery and Management of Worms in Cats
Depending on the type, cats that are mildly infected with worms can completely recover within a few weeks.

If your cat has symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or low appetite, your vet may prescribe a gastrointestinal probiotic such as FortiFlora® or Proviable® to aid digestion and provide immune system support.

Cats that are severely affected with hookworm and/or roundworm infection may require:


        
        Deworming medications
        
        
        Hospitalization
        
        
        Supportive care, such as fluid therapy and blood transfusions (in cases of anemia)
        


If an intestinal blockage is found from a large burden of worms, emergency surgery may be needed to remove the worms in your cat.

If you suspect your cat has worms, call their veterinarian.
How do you get rid of worms in cats naturally?Despite claims that remedies such as garlic and apple cider vinegar can get rid of worms, there are no safe or effective “natural” treatments for deworming in cats. These remedies don’t kill worms and can even cause toxicity to your cat.

The safest way to treat your cat is through your veterinarian.
Can I get worms from my cat?Some worms can infect humans by ingestion of eggs from soil, sandboxes, or handling infected cats.

Cats don’t have to show signs of illness to be actively shedding worm eggs. Young children and immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible. And although these types of infections are rare, worm infections can potentially cause skin, eye, or liver issues in humans.

If your cat is infected with worms, scoop the litter box daily, regularly change out the litter and disinfect the litter box, and always wash your hands after handling it.

Separate your infected cat and newly adopted kittens or cats until they have been examined, have had stool tests and deworming, and are cleared by your vet.

Symptoms of worms in cats may vary. You can usually determine the type of worm based on your cat’s symptoms:


        
        Diarrhea or soft stool; you may see worms in the stool
        
        
        Vomiting (worms may be seen in the vomit)
        
        
        Pot-bellied (distended) abdomen
        
        
        Thin body condition and weight loss
        
        
        General unhealthy appearance including dull hair coat
        
        
        Pale gums (hookworms only)
        
        
        Coughing or trouble breathing can be seen if worms migrate to the lungs (hookworms, roundworms)

6,Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome in Cats,"Normally, the electrical impulse needed for the heart to beat begins in the sinoatrial node -- the pacemaker of the heart located in the right atrium (one of the heart's top two chambers) -- is transmitted to the ventricles (the heart's bottom two chambers) and then passes through the atrioventricular (AV) node into the AV bundle. Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) is when ventricular pre-excitation occurs as impulses originating in the sinoatrial node or atrium activate a portion of the ventricles prematurely through an accessory pathway without going through the AV node, causing, among other things, an abnormally fast heart beat rhythm (supraventricular tachycardia). (The remainder of the ventricles is activated normally through the usual conduction system.) 

Symptoms and Types


    Fainting (syncope)
    Extremely rapid heart rate (approaching 400 to 500 beats per minute)


Causes

WPW syndrome can be associated with congenital or acquired heart defects.

Congenital Heart Disease

    Congenital defect limited to the heart beat’s conduction system
    Hole in between the two atria (atrial septal defect)


Acquired Heart Disease

    Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel -- the results of which are typically normal. Echocardiography, meanwhile, may show structural heart disease often associated WPW syndrome.

Treatment

If your cat is suffering from ventricular pre-excitation but does not have tachycardia, no treatment is needed. However, those with WPW syndrome will require conversion by dirrect shock (the most effective treatment) or by ocular or carotid sinus pressure, or drugs. 

Catheter ablation with radiofrequency current is a relatively recent technique that allows accessory pathways to be destroyed or ablated by a transvenous catheter positioned at the site of the pathway in the heart. It may be recommended due to the alternative: a lifelong therapy of drugs.

Living and Management

The prognosis depends on the severity of the underlying cause.  Most pets with WPW syndrome, however, respond well to therapy for supraventricular tachycardia."," and Types

7,Whipworms in Cats,"What Are Whipworms in Cats?
Feline whipworms are intestinal parasites that infect the area where the small and large intestine intersect, called the cecum. Untreated, this parasite can damage the tissue, leading to diarrhea and blood loss.

This parasite is transmitted to a cat through food or water contaminated by fecal matter that contains whipworms or their eggs. Infections are comparatively rare in cats and more common in dogs. Cats can become infected from other cats, but they do not pose a risk to human family members.

Symptoms of Whipworm Infection in Cats
Fortunately, most infections are mild in cats, and in many cases a cat will not show any symptoms. A few worms generally don’t cause significant problems. Health concerns arise when a cat is heavily infected. In these rare cases, cats can experience extreme illness or possibly die from the infection.

Symptoms of severe infection include:


	Bloody diarrhea, with or without mucus
	Weight loss
	Dehydration
	General malaise
	Anemia (low red blood cell count)


Whipworms live in the cecum and large intestine, so they are rarely seen by the naked eye. Eggs are microscopic. 
Causes of Whipworms in Cats
Whipworms infest fecal matter, which can contaminate food, water, or other surfaces (such as a toy or another cat). A cat often becomes infected in this way. Whipworm eggs can survive in the environment for years and are often ingested through self-grooming behaviors and mutual sharing of a litterbox or outside yard. 

Once deposited on the ground, the eggs mature and become infectious after about three weeks. When swallowed, they hatch and mature into adult worms, mate, and reproduce. Eggs are then shed by the female about 12 weeks later and the lifecycle continues. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Whipworm Infection in Cats
Given the lifecycle and that eggs are shed in small numbers at irregular intervals, sometimes it can take multiple examinations and samples before arriving at a diagnosis. Treatment for parasitical infection may be recommended, even if your cat’s tests do not indicate whipworm as the culprit. Tests used to diagnose whipworm include:


	Fecal flotation with centrifugation: This is the most common test performed for parasitical infections. Feces are mixed with a solution, spun, and then analyzed under a microscope looking for the presence of eggs.
	Fecal antigen test (ELISA): In this test, feces are sampled for evidence of whipworm antigen (substances produced by the worm that elicits an immune response), which may often help detect infections in their early stages.
	PCR: A test that uses genetic material to identify a specific organism if whipworms are presumed but not confirmed. This test requires sending fecal samples to an outside laboratory to detect whipworm DNA.


Treatment of Whipworms in Cats
Treatment is fairly cost-effective and simple. Oral dewormer medications such as Panacur® (fenbendazole) are often prescribed for a few days or longer if necessary.

Recovery and Management of Whipworms in Cats
It’s important to have your cat’s stool reexamined after several weeks of treatment to ensure the infection has completely cleared. Another treatment is often recommended after a few months. If your cat goes outside, clean her paws off to minimize the chances of ingesting whipworm eggs. 

There are no current monthly whipworm preventatives, so parasite control must begin at home with good hygiene and sanitation practices.


	
	Remove feces daily and regularly clean the litterbox with a disinfectant.
	
	
	Keep your cat from roaming outside or contacting other animals that may be at risk of infection.
	
	
	Regular pest control and home hygiene (such as removing shoes upon entering the home).
	

Prevention of Whipworms in Cats
Preventing whipworm infection requires removing feces daily and cleaning the litterbox frequently with diluted bleach. If your cat enjoys the yard, remove fecal matter. If the yard area is in direct sunlight, that helps in prevention as well.
Whipworms in Cats FAQsAre whipworms in cats contagious to humans?A cat with whipworms does not pose a risk to their human family. Whipworms are host-specific, meaning they are only contagious to other cats.
How do indoor cats get whipworms?Whipworms are present in fecal matter, which a cat can ingest accidentally. Most cats become infected through self-grooming. Additionally, there’s a good chance that eggs are brought inside on a family member’s clothing and shoes. And don’t forget that cats are good hunters and will just about hunt anything inside the home, including rodents, insects, and other pests, which could harbor parasites and cause infection when ingested.
What does a whipworm look like?Whipworms are named for their characteristic whip or lasso appearance. About five centimeters maximum in length, their posterior is thicker and bigger than their anterior. Eggs are microscopic and football-shaped, thick-shelled with plugs at either end. Their coloring is from yellow to brown.

9,Weak Immune System due to Hereditary Disorder in Cats,"Primary Immunodeficiency Disorders in Cats

The term immune system is used to denote the collection of biological processes that take part in an effort to protect the body against disease by timely identifying and killing the invading pathogens and tumor cells. It works on a regular basis in order to guard the body against invading organisms and infections such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
 
Primary immunodeficiency disorders involve poor or weak immune system responses when required. These disorders are seen due to any defect(s) in immune system related to some heritable disease. On the contrary, secondary immunodeficiency disorders are seen due to some other primary disease.
 
Few kittens may have congenital problems related to immune system.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Prone to recurrent infections and failed response to conventional antibiotic therapies
    Lethargy
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Various skin infections
    Poor growth (hallmark)
    Post vaccination diseases
    Other symptoms related to infections

 
Causes
 
Immunodeficiency disorders are a congenital disorder; i.e., cats are born with them.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may reveal various cell abnormalities or clues for infections. More specific tests are available for a more detailed evaluation of the immune system, and may be employed by the veterinarian with your consent. For example, he or she may take a bone marrow sample from your cat for evaluation.





Treatment
 
Unfortunately, no cure is available for congenital problems with the immune system. In cases of severe disease, hospitalization may be required to stabilize your cat. In the case of mild problems, your cat can be taken home after therapy.
 
Prevention of infection is the key factor for keeping your cat healthy, and good management practices are required to prevent exposure to infections. In cases of infection, your veterinarian will give an antibiotic cover to treat infection; it may take a few days to a few weeks for a complete resolution of infections. Delay in recovery is due to poor immune system support in treating infections, and prolonged antibiotic cover is usually required.
 
Living and Management
 
Prognosis largely depends upon the nature and extent of the problem. However, the animal cannot be complete “cured.” You should discuss the issue of hereditary diseases with your cat’s veterinarian and how these should be prevented in future litters.
 
In some cats, complete rest may be advised to prevent further complications. Diet is another important factor to meet for your cat’s daily nutritional requirements. Exposure to infection should be minimized in those animals prone to infections due to some hereditary problem."," and Types

10,Watery Eyes (Epiphora) in Cats,"Why Do Cats Have Watery Eyes?
Watery eyes in cats, also called epiphora, is an overflow of tears from the cat’s eyes. While cats can have other types of discharge from their eyes, such as mucus or pus, epiphora refers to tears. 

When a cat has watery eyes, one of two things is occurring. Either the cat’s eyes don’t drain their tears sufficiently, or the cat’s eyes produce excessive amounts of tears. In both scenarios, the tears spill over the lower eyelids and can be seen around the eyes or on the cat’s face, often at the middle corner near the nose.

Watery eyes are very common in cats. Most pet parents will notice that their cat has a watery eye at some point in their cat’s lifespan.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Watery Eyes in Cats
Common signs associated with watery eyes in cats include:


	
	Wetness beneath the eyes
	
	
	Staining of the fur beneath the eyes (often reddish-brown, especially in light-colored cats)
	
	
	Redness and/or swelling of the skin under eyes
	
	
	Squinting one or both eyes
	
	
	Excessive blinking
	
	
	Redness and/or swelling of the pink tissue (conjunctiva) inside the eyelids
	
	
	Changes to the color or clarity of the eye, such as redness or cloudiness
	
	
	Sneezing or discharge from the nose
	
	
	Pawing at the eyes
	


Causes of Watery Eyes in Cats
Epiphora occurs due to excessive tear production or insufficient tear drainage. Underlying causes include:


	
	Blockage of the nasolacrimal duct, which drains tears from the eyes to the nose. This duct is why your nose gets runny when you cry, and your cat has this duct, too. Blockage can be due to congenital failure of the duct to open, inflammation and debris within the duct, or tumors that block the duct.
	
	
	Specific breed conformation that causes poor drainage, such as the flat face of Persians or Himalayans
	
	
	Infections affecting the eye, such as feline herpesvirus
	
	
	Allergies
	
	
	Eye injury, such as a scratch on the cornea during a cat fight
	
	
	Corneal ulcers
	
	
	Abnormal growth of eyelashes that rub on the cornea (distichiasis and ectopic cilia)
	
	
	Eyelids that roll in (entropion)
	
	
	Eyelids that roll out (ectropion)
	
	
	Glaucoma
	
	Tumors in or around the eye

Why Does My Cat Only Have One Watery Eye?
It’s very common for a cat to have only one watery eye at a time. Many cats with conjunctivitis, caused by herpesvirus, only show signs in one eye. Other potential causes include an abnormal eyelash on that eye, irritation or injury to that eye, or blockage of the nasolacrimal duct on one side.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Watery Eyes in Cats
Watery eyes in cats are a symptom of an underlying condition, so your veterinarian will focus on diagnosing and managing the underlying cause. Diagnostic tests include:


	
	Looking into your cat’s eye with an ophthalmoscope (fundic exam).
	
	
	Measuring tear production by placing testing trips inside the lower eyelid (Schirmer tear test).
	
	
	Staining the eye with fluorescein to look for ulcers.
	
	
	Performing a Jones test, where the veterinarian examines if fluorescein placed in the eye becomes visible at the nostril, which would indicate an open nasolacrimal duct .
	
	
	Measuring the pressure in the eyes to rule out glaucoma.
	
	
	Looking under the eyelid for abnormal eyelashes, which may require sedation.
	


In cases where the nasolacrimal duct is newly blocked and cannot be flushed open, the veterinarian may recommend a computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out space-occupying masses that are blocking the duct as it courses from the eye to the nose.

If your cat has recurrent episodes of watery eyes, your veterinarian may test for specific infectious causes like feline herpesvirus. This involves swabbing inside the eyelids, the nose, or the back of the throat and then submitting the samples to a laboratory.

Treatment of Watery Eyes in Cats
Treatment of watery eyes in cats is geared toward managing the underlying cause of epiphora.

In cats that have epiphora due to their facial conformation, like Himalayans, management will focus on keeping the face clean. Use gentle wipes intended for pets to clean under the eyes.

For cats with eye infections, medications include topical antibiotics (such as oxytetracycline or triple antibiotic ointments intended for pets) or topical antivirals like idoxuridine. In cats with other signs of upper respiratory infection, like nasal discharge, or in cats who do not tolerate eye drops, antibiotics given by mouth such as doxycycline or azithromycin may be recommended.

Cats with eyelid abnormalities or abnormal eyelashes typically require surgery. For example, in cats with rolled-in eyelids, surgery can evert the eyelid so that eyelashes don’t rub on the cat’s cornea. In cats with ectopic cilia, the abnormal hair may be surgically removed or the hair follicle may be frozen to prevent regrowth (cryosurgery).

If the nasolacrimal duct is blocked, a small tube is sometimes placed in the opening of the duct to allow the veterinarian to flush saline through it. Flushing the duct may help to clear it. If there is an infection, the cat should be started on oral antibiotics like doxycycline. In some cases, surgery may be required for treatment.

Although tumors causing blockage of the nasolacrimal duct are relatively rare, they should be considered in a cat that has a new nasolacrimal duct blockage without evidence of infection. If your cat has a tumor, treatment options may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. These tumors are best managed by a veterinary oncologist.

Recovery and Management of Watery Eyes in Cats
Most causes of watery eyes in cats are manageable, and cats generally do very well. Some cats may have watery eyes long-term, but they can be managed by cleaning their face with gentle, unscented, pet-friendly wipes.

A buildup of moisture can cause an infection of the skin around the eyes. If you notice that the skin around the eyes appears irritated, consider seeking veterinary advice.

If the cause of the watery eyes is an injury or something that causes irritation, an Elizabethan collar (e-collar or cone) will likely be recommended to keep the pet from scratching at or rubbing the eye.
Watery Eyes in Cats FAQsShould I be worried if my cat’s eye is watering?Most cases of watery eyes aren’t serious and are easily managed. However, if your cat doesn’t usually have watery eyes, the symptoms continue for more than a few hours, or your pet appears bothered by their eye, contact your veterinarian.
Are watery eyes painful for cats?If there is an injury to the eye, an eyelash rubbing on the cornea, or inflammation affecting the eye, this can cause discomfort. Cats with a facial structure that causes watery eyes (like Persians) or whose nasolacrimal ducts did not open aren’t usually painful.
What are the most common reasons for watery eyes in cats?The most common cause of watery eyes in cats is a viral infection, often feline herpesvirus. For flat-faced breeds, facial conformation preventing tear drainage is the most common cause of watery eyes.

11,Water Mold Infection (Pythiosis) in Cats,"Pythiosis in Cats

Cats are rarely infected with the Pythium insidiosum spore, but when they are, they are more likely to develop cutaneous pythiosis. Cats at risk for this water borne infection are those that swim in warm water that is infected with the aquatic pathogen.

Belonging to the phylum Oomycota, Pythium insidiosum is a parasitic spore that is capable of spontaneous movement (or a motile zoospore) that enters the body through the nose/sinuses, esophagus, or through the skin. Infection then usually settles in the cat's lungs, brain, sinuses, gastrointestinal tract, or skin.

Affected cats will exhibit cutaneous or subcutaneous masses, which develop behind the eyeball, around the eye, around the nasopharynx, at the base of the tail, or on the footpads.

Pythiosis is typically thought of as occurring in swampy areas in the southeastern U.S., and has thus been nicknamed “swamp cancer.” Signs of pythiosis usually appear in the fall or early winter months, and while this organism does typically thrive in tropical and subtropical waters, such as ponds, wetlands, and swamps, it has been found to occur as far west as the central valley of California.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn about how pythiosis affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Pythiosis of the lungs, brain, or sinus will manifest in the cat as stuffiness, head pain, fever, coughing, and swelling of the sinuses. Infection of the cat's digestive tract leads to a chronic disease, which causes the tissue of the stomach and/or intestines to become severely thick. Other symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) pythiosis include:


    Fever
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Regurgitation
    Long-term 	weight loss
    Abdominal 	mass
    Abdominal 	pain
    Enlarged 	lymph nodes


Pythiosis of the skin (or cutaneous pythiosis) results in the development of swollen, non-healing wounds, and invasive masses of ulcerated pus-filled nodules and draining tracts. Tissue death (necrosis) follows, with the affected skin eventually turning black and wasting.

Causes

This infection is caused by direct contact with water that accommodates Pythium insidiosum, a water borne fungal parasite. It is usually swallowed or inhaled by the cat, later making its way into the animal's intestinal tract.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A blood sample will be sent for serological testing (via an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, called ELISA) to the Pythium Laboratory at Louisiana State University.

You will then need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and recent activities, including any exposure your pet may have had to water in the last several months.

Abdominal X-rays in cats with GI pythiosis may show an intestinal blockage, intestinal wall thickening, or an abdominal mass. An ultrasound image of the cat's abdomen will tend to show thickening of the wall of the stomach or intestine. Enlarged lymph nodes may also be evident, as it is an indication of an infection.

  

While a biopsy can suggest a diagnosis of pythiosis, a positive culture will be needed for a definitive diagnosis. There is also an immunohisto-chemical stain, which specifically attaches to P. insidiosum hyphae in thin sections of tissue.

Another method for definitively diagnosing pythiosis is to test tissue samples and cultured isolates with nested Polymerase Chain Reaction, a test of the cat's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

Treatment

The sooner you take your cat for treatment after the first signs appear, the better the prognosis.

All cats will need to undergo surgical removal of as much affected tissue as possible. The tissue remaining after surgery will then be treated with a laser (photoablation) to kill any fungal filaments in the surrounding tissue. Enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity should be biopsied (tissue will be surgically removed for examination). Medical therapy should be continued for a minimum of six months.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every two to three months after the initial surgery so that ELISA serological tests can be performed. Abdominal X-rays should be retaken at each visit to re-evaluate intestinal signs of disease. A chemical blood profile should be repeated at each check-up, as well, to monitor your pet for liver toxicity while it is being treated with Itraconazole, the drug of choice for treating pythiosis."," and Types

12,Wart Virus in Cats,"Papillomatosis in Cats

 

The term papillomatosis is used to describe a benign tumor on the surface of the skin. Caused by a virus known as the papillomavirus, the growth is black, raised, and wart-like, with an open pore in the central surface if the tumor is inverted.

 

There are instances where the papillomatosis can progress, causing common forms of skin cancer. It is also possible for invasive cancerous cells to penetrate and begin eating the underlying tissues. In cats, the most common papillomavirus often multiplies (metastasizes), and may progress to an invasive carcinoma, or cancer, which will then affect the cell structure. They are usually located around the lips, mouth and tongue. However, the skin can be affected at any age.



Papillomatosis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms related to this disorder include bad breath associated with oral papillomatosis, bleeding from the mouth, increased or decreased appetite, and excessive excretion of saliva. In cats, papillomas will appear around the head, neck and limbs, and will be either solitary or in multiple groups.

 

Causes

 

Papillomatosis is contagious in nature and in older cats, this disorder can arise due to the immune system being suppressed through the use of medication, surgery, or in some instances, disease. There are some cases where the wart virus is genetically related by breed.

 

Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will take a biopsy of the lesions if the papillomavirus is oral in nature. When there is evidence that the papillomatosis has affected the skin, or there are visible changes to the skin and cellular structures, pathology tests will be required. Further tests associated with the immune system will establish whether viral antibodies are present within the lesions.

 

 

 



Treatment

 

Oral lesions will generally disappear of their own accord. Surgery may be performed to remove any oral tumors; however, your cat will not be able to eat comfortably for a period of time after the surgery. Your veterinarian will advise you on what foods will be most appropriate for your pet during the recovery process. Use of medication may also aid in the removal of warts, but this treatment will be discontinued if the condition recurs.

 

If the papillomavirus is persistent, vaccination against it may be beneficial to your pet. Your cat should also be examined for any signs of immune disorders.

 

Living and Management

 

To ensure that malignant changes do not occur in the tumor, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits to further monitor the lesions for alterations.

 

Prevention

 

Due to the contagious nature of this disease, it is important to separate infected animals from those that are not infected with the papillomavirus. Oral vaccination can be administered as a preventative measure against this disease, and is routinely used in commercial kennels when outbreaks do occur.

13,Walking Dandruff in Cats,"Walking Dandruff in Cats 
Walking dandruff, or cheyletiellosis in cats, is a skin condition caused by the highly contagious Cheyletiella mites. On cats, these mites feed on skin dander and skin secretions, causing extensive dandruff and other symptoms. 



A Cheyletiella infestation is also referred to as walking dandruff. The irritation caused by the mites causes scaling of the skin. These scales are moved around by the mites’ activity. This gives the impression of walking dandruff. 



Cheyletiella mites are very mobile and can easily infect cats, dogs, and rabbits. They can even affect humans, causing small, itchy bites. Fortunately, they can’t survive permanently on humans, but they can be a nuisance.

Check your pet’s symptom
Causes of Walking Dandruff in Cats
Walking dandruff in cats can be caused by:


	
	Direct contact with other animals with cheyletiellosis.
	
	
	Being in an animal shelter, a grooming establishment, or a kennel with other animals that have cheyletiellosis. Mites can be transmitted through brushes, leashes, collars, and grooming tools. 
	
	
	Reinfestation from recently contaminated bedding or housing. 
	


Cheyletiella have been found on fleas, lice, and flies, so these insects may help to transport Cheyletiella between pets.

Walking Dandruff Symptoms in Cats
Cats with walking dandruff usually show these symptoms:


	
	Excessive skin scaling and dandruff, generally along the back
	
	
	Itching
	
	
	Overgrooming
	
	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Crusty sores
	
	
	Some cats may have very mild or no symptoms
	


Diagnosis of Walking Dandruff in Cats
If your cat has symptoms of walking dandruff, your vet may confirm the diagnosis by: 


	
	Brushing your cat and examining the debris under a microscope  
	
	
	Using tape to pick up flakes from their skin and examining them under a microscope
	
	
	Taking superficial skin scrapings to examine under a microscope
	
	
	Plucking hairs to look for attached eggs, also under a microscope
	




Mites may be difficult to find, so the diagnosis is sometimes made based on a cat’s response to treatment. In some cases, mites and eggs may be detected with a stool test, particularly in cats that overgroom and ingest the mites.

Treatment for Walking Dandruff in Cats
Because these mites are so contagious, if you have an outbreak on one animal, you’ll need to treat all dogs, cats, and rabbits in your home or that come into contact with your cat. 

There is no licensed product for the treatment of these mites. However, walking dandruff can usually be treated by most flea and tick control products. 



Repeated treatment may be necessary, depending upon what product you use. Your veterinarian will prescribe a product best suited for your pets. 



Treatment of the house is generally not needed if you use long-acting flea preventatives. However, since mites can live off the host for up to 10 days, you may need to treat your home with a flea control product to kill roaming mites that could re-infect your cat or other pets.

Recovery and Management of Walking Dandruff in Cats
Routine use of most flea preventatives on your cat will help prevent recurrences.

14,Vomiting with Bile in Cats,"Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats



Bile is a bitter, yellow-green fluid that is created in the liver and stored in the gallbladder until food has been ingested. It is then released into the small intestine to aid in digestion of food and to emulsify the food so that it can be used appropriately by the body. Bile also carries various waste materials out of the body along with the feces.



Bilious vomiting syndrome occurs due to motility problems, when bile abnormally enters into the stomach, causing irritation and vomiting. That is, when the gastrointestinal tract fails to react automatically to the normal functions that occur within the tract, contents in the tract do not move as they should, causing abnormal behaviors within the system. Bile that has entered into the stomach is expelled by the cat, and the vomit contents are found to contain bile.



This reaction is usually seen in the early morning or late night just before eating, especially in cats that are fed once daily. It is a rare condition in cats; when it does occur it is usually in older cats. Both genders are equally affected.

 

Symptoms and Types




	Chronic intermittent vomiting containing bile
	Usually occurs in the morning or late night just before eating
	Abdominal discomfort
	Nausea
	Lack of appetite
	Weight loss




Causes




	The exact cause is still unknown
	Diseases causing gastritis or inflammation of the intestine, leading to modified gastrointestinal motility


 

Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, a background history of symptoms, possible incidents that might have led to this condition, and recent activities. As much as you can, you will need to tell your veterinarian when the symptoms began, and how frequently the vomiting occurs.



Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, with a complete blood profile, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.



A history of intermittent vomiting with bile contents is usually enough for a preliminary diagnosis. In the course of diagnosing this disease, laboratory testing is not of much help as the results are usually within normal ranges. Specific radiographic and ultrasound imaging studies of the abdomen may reveal delayed stomach motility. Endoscopic examination often returns normal in these patients.









Treatment



If there is no serious underlying disease present, your doctor will decide on an appropriate line of treatment based on the symptoms. Drugs to enhance gastric motility will be used to overcome delayed emptying of stomach, increase stomach and gut motility and thus prevent reflux. Also, drugs that will decrease acid secretion in the stomach can be used to prevent damage to the stomach wall due to the increased acidic contents of the bile.



Most patients respond well to such treatment; the length of time your cat is going to need medication will depend on its individual response. Some animals respond quickly to the treatment, while others need a longer course of medication. For patients suffering chronic bilious vomiting, dietary management is a very important component of treatment, usually involving feeding small, frequent meals, especially late at night. Preventing the stomach from being empty for long periods of time will help to increase normal stomach motility. Diets low in fat and fiber content will also help the stomach to empty and reduce gastric retention of food.



Your veterinarian may also suggest canned or liquefied diets, which also can be helpful in such patients because solid food tend to stay longer in the stomach.



Living and Management



The prognosis is excellent for most cats, given that they respond well to dietary changes and medications.

15,Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency in Cats,"Thiamine Deficiency in Cats

Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is a water-soluble vitamin necessary for normal carbohydrate metabolism in cats. Thiamine deficiency results in serious symptoms, many of which are neurological in origin.

Symptoms and Types

 Neurological signs are frequently seen with thiamine deficiency and include:


    Ventriflexion (bending      towards the floor) or curling of the neck
    Incoordination
    Abnormal or spastic      gait
    Circling
    Falling
    Head tilt
    Dilated pupils
    Opisthotonos (backward arching of the head, neck, and spine)
    Stupor
    Seizures


Neurological symptoms may be preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting. Excess salivation, depressed appetite, and weight loss can also be seen before neurological symptoms present.

Causes

There are many potential causes of thiamine deficiency. These include:


    Prolonged      lack of appetite
    Diseases      that cause malassimilation or malabsorption of nutrients
    Extensive      surgical resection of jejunum and ileum
    Diuresis      (excessive urination)
    Feeding      an all meat diet
    Feeding      meat based diet that has been preserved with sulfur dioxide
    Consumption      of diet which has destroyed vitamin B1 during food processing. Some food      recalls have been related to thiamine destruction which occurred during      processing and caused inadequate thiamine levels in food. Food lacking      adequate quantities of thiamine may in turn cause a thiamine deficiency      for cats eating the food.
    Destruction      of B1 by thiaminase present in some bacteria and in certain types of raw      fish (cod, catfish, carp, herring, etc).


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will base the diagnosis based on the presence of clinical signs associated with thiamine deficiency, a history of ingestion of food deficient in thiamine, or other factors that may lead to thiamine deficiency, and response to treatment. Thiamine levels in blood can also be measured to confirm thiamine deficiency.



Treatment

Thiamine can be injected or given orally. Providing adequate quantities of thiamine is the treatment of choice.

Prevention

Feed a high quality, well balanced diet."," and Types

16,Vitamin A Poisoning in Cats,"Vitamin A Toxicity in Cats

Vitamin A is essential for a cat's night vision as well as for a healthy skin. It also supports the cat's immune system and contains important antioxidant properties, which help to protect the body against pollution, cancer formation, and other diseases. If taken in exorbitant levels, however, vitamin A can be toxic.

More commonly referred to as vitamin A toxicity, it usually occurs when vitamin A-rich food such as liver or vitamin A supplements are ingested at high quantities. Though it is likelier to occur in cats ages 2-9, it can affect cats of any age.

Symptoms and Types


    Lethargy
    Loss of appetite
    Weight loss
    Lameness
    Rough hair coat
    Constipation
    Abnormal sitting posture (e.g., raised front limbs)
    Skin allergy on neck and front limb regions


Causes


    Vitamin A-enriched diets (raw 	liver)
    Excessive vitamin A 	supplementation (cod liver oil)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will take detailed history of your cat, including asking questions pertaining to your pet's diet and supplement regimen (if any). A detailed physical examination will be conducted to rule out other diseases. In addition, your veterinarian will order routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. However, the results of these tests are often found to be normal unless the cat has some concurrent disease.

In some cats the complete blood count may reveal an increased number of white blood cells (WBCs), especially neutrophils. A biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may indicate abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood. Your veterinarian will also take X-rays of neck regions to visualize the vertebrae present in neck area (cervical vertebrae) as well as other areas; new bone formation is often an indicator of vitamin A toxicity.

In order to confirm the diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will most likely order blood tests to determine the level of vitamin A.

Treatment

Many cats begin to recover as soon as the source of the vitamin A toxicity is no longer ingested, whether it be due to something in the diet (e.g., raw liver) or supplements. Your veterinarian can recommend a well-balanced diet for your cat's needs. To treat the pain, he or she may recommend painkillers.

Living and Management

The overall prognosis of this type of poisoning depends on the early initiation of treatment and the age of the cat. In mature cats, the symptoms usually resolve successfully, with the exception of the bone malformations. On the other hand, young cats can suffer from permanent damage to long bones which raise various other health concerns.

Periodic determination of vitamin A levels in the blood may be required to confirm the successful resolution of high vitamin A levels in the blood.

Prevention

The best way to prevent vitamin A toxicity in cats is to consult your veterinarian before changing your pet's diet and/or starting it on a vitamin A supplement regimen. In addition, do not allow others to feed your cat without your permission, especially if the food contains liver."," and Types

17,Vestibular Disease in Cats,"What Is Vestibular Disease in Cats?
If you’ve ever experienced dizziness or vertigo, then you’ve experienced the vestibular system when it stops working. The vestibular system controls balance and coordination in both humans and other mammals, including cats. It is located in the inner ear and the brain.

When this system is disrupted, the cat's world view and axis is shifted. It becomes challenging to tell which way is down and which way is up. Consequently, cats suffering from vestibular disease may develop a head tilt, fall over, and have trouble walking. Oftentimes this unsettling feeling of loss of balance leads to nausea and vomiting. Vestibular disease in cats usually comes on very suddenly and is more common in Siamese and Burmese breeds. While it’s most commonly seen in senior cats, felines of any age can be affected.

Symptoms of Vestibular Disease in Cats

	Rapid, jerking eye movements (nystagmus)
	Head tilt
	Circling or falling to one side
	Loss of balance (ataxia)
	Vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite
	Facial drooping, “Horner’s Syndrome” 


Causes of Vestibular Disease in Cats
Anything that can damage the vestibular apparatus can lead to vestibular disease. Oftentimes, no underlying cause is found, and it is classified as Idiopathic Vestibular Syndrome. “Idiopathic” means the cause is unknown. Vestibular disease may be caused by:


	Inner or middle ear infection
	Unknown cause (“Idiopathic”)
	Bacterial or inflammatory conditions of the brain, like Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) or intracranial empyema (brain abscess)
	Drug reaction
	Cancerous tumors, cysts, or polyps that grow in regions near the inner ear or brain. These are more common in senior cats. Sometimes these tumors are brain tumors that are very serious, and other times they may be benign polyps in the ear that are less serious.
	Thiamine deficiency


How Veterinarians Diagnose Vestibular Disease in Cats
Vestibular disease is most often diagnosed via a physical exam by your veterinarian. There is no one test that will confirm this disease. Instead, the vet will want to check your cat thoroughly and screen for signs of problems that could cause vestibular disease, like an ear infection or a growth that may be disrupting the vestibular apparatus.

Blood work may be recommended to screen for signs of an underlying systemic infection in your cat’s body. The vet may recommend x-rays of your cat’s skull to see if there are any obvious masses. Ear cultures may be helpful if signs of an ear infection are present. Occasionally, referral to a veterinary neurologist may be in order if advanced diagnostics, like MRI or CT, are recommended.

Treatment of Vestibular Disease in Cats
If there are underlying causes (like an inner ear infection or polyp) that are discovered on exam, then treatment involves addressing the underlying cause. Antibiotics may be useful if there is an infection present, or anti-inflammatory drugs if obvious inflammation is precipitating the disease. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove troublesome polyps (or growths) if your cat is otherwise healthy and a good candidate for anesthesia.

In most vestibular patients, no underlying cause is ever found. Fortunately, this disease often improves on its own over a couple days, with the majority of signs resolving over a few weeks. Very rarely will cats have a subtle head tilt or facial drooping remaining long after having a diagnosis of vestibular disease.

During the recovery period, it is important to provide supportive care. Helping your cat with the food and water bowl so that it can eat and drink—and even helping it in and out of the litter box—may be necessary. Anti-nausea medications, like Cerenia, are often beneficial initially while your cat is going through the worst of its dizziness and vertigo sensations. Sometimes hospitalization is required for a few days until the worst of the vestibular disease signs pass. 

Recovery and Management of Vestibular Disease in Cats
The worst of the disease signs usually last 24 to 48 hours. Most cats with vestibular disease will be mostly normal after a period of 2 to 3 weeks. The overall prognosis for this disease is good with most patients making a full recovery, and not having any repeat episodes in the future.

18,Verterbral Disc Inflammation in Cats,"Diskspondylitis in Cats

In cats, as with other vertebrates, the vertebral column is composed of a series of vertebral bones. These bones maintain the structure of the body and serve in the protection of the spinal cord, which is nested within the vertebral column.

Between each vertebrae are structures called disks. These round, cartilaginous shock absorbers hold a nucleus of fibrous gel, which allows for normal movement of the vertebrae without the vertebral bones grinding against each other.

Diskspondylitis is the inflammation of vertebral disks due to an infection caused by the invasion of bacteria or fungus. The infections most commonly reach the intervertebral disks through the blood. Less common is infection due to fractures or local abscesses. Due to the proximity of the spinal cord many of the symptoms seen in affected animals are related to the nervous system. This disease is relatively rare in cats as compared to dogs.

Symptoms and Types


    Back pain
    Difficulty in standing and jumping
    Stiff, uncoordinated walk
    Limb weakness
    Lameness
    Fever
    Paralysis in some patients, 	especially those not treated


Causes


    Bacterial infections
    Fungal infections
    Surgery
    Bite wounds
    Fracture
    Back injury
    Abscess near site of inflammation


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. After the initial physical examination, your veterinarian will order routine laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests can be of value in determining the presence of any infections that are primary causes of this disease. Your veterinarian will also take blood and urine samples for laboratory culturing in order to identify the causative bacteria or fungus. Drug sensitivity testing may also help your veterinarian to select the most effective drug(s) for your cat so that the underlying infection is appropriately treated.

Radiographic studies will help your veterinarian to determine the location of the inflamed disc, as well as the extent of the problem in your cat. Spinal X-rays will usually reveal damage to the vertebra and adjacent structures that have occurred due to infection. Displacement and collapse of intervertebral (between the vertebral bones) disks will also be evident in spinal X-rays. More specific radiographic studies, such as myelography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for a more detailed  and concise evaluation.

Myelography is a type of radiographic technique that uses an injectable substance that will contrast suitably on an X-ray device, in effect, ""lighting"" the internal area that is to be examined. This minimally invasive technique may allow your doctor to detect abnormalities of the spinal cord, making visible any compressions in the spinal cord, especially in those cases in which surgery may be required. Your veterinarian may also use CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans if normal X-rays and myelography imaging does not provide the needed details.

  

Treatment

If your cat is suffering severe pain or has an apparent neurological deficit, your veterinarian may  recommend hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. If the condition is still relatively recent, your cat may be managed medically on an outpatient basis. In others cases, where the disc and/or spinal cord has become severely affected, surgery may be required to decrease pressure on the spinal cord. During surgery, your veterinarian will remove any infected tissue and fluid, and may also remove a portion of affected vertebral bone if called for. Antibiotics can be used to control the residing infections, and pain killers can be used to control the pain that is associated with this disease.

Living and Management

While your cat is recovering you can help to keep it comfortable by providing a soft, dry, well padded surface in a quiet location in the house. Cage rest might be suitable under the circumstances, both to prevent the cat from moving and exacerbating the problem, and to protect it from others (other pets, children, etc.). Wherever you set your cat up, encourage it to keep its movement to a minimum by placing its food and litter box close by. Be sure to check on your cat throughout the day.

Because your cat will most likely be resting a lot as it heals from the injury or infection, you will need to make sure that it does not lay in the same position for too long, changing its position throughout the day to prevent ulcers from developing due to prolonged rest in same body posture. Watch your cat’s response to treatment and inform your veterinarian if you notice anything abnormal in your cat.

Your veterinarian will need to see your cat for a follow-up evaluation, to make sure that the site is healing properly. Response to both medical and surgical treatment is variable in different animal patients depending on age, breed, size and other considerations.

Complete antibiotic treatment is mandatory for successful treatment and eradication of the infection. Often, the symptoms will retreat soon after beginning medication, but this does no mean that the infection has been thoroughly eradicated. If such treatment is stopped prematurely, symptoms will recur, perhaps even worse than before. If your cat has been prescribed pain medication, follow your veterinarian's directions strictly. One of the most avoidable causes of pet deaths is from over medication."," and Types

"
19,Ventricular Standstill in Cats,"Asystole in Cats   Ventricular standstill, also termed asystole, is an absence of ventricular complexes (called QRS) measured on an electrocardiogram (ECG), or absence of ventricular activity (electrical-mechanical dissociation).  Electrical-mechanical dissociation is when there is a recorded ECG cardiac rhythm (P–QRS–T), but no effective cardiac output or palpable femoral pulse (the pulse of the artery in the inner thigh).     There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are the atria (single: atrium), and two bottom chambers are the ventricles. Valves are provided between each atrial and ventricular pair, each on the left and right side, allowing blood to pass from the atria to the ventricles, where it is then pumped out of the heart into the body – the right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, and the left ventricle pumps blood  to the body. The heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern.    Ventricular standstill will lead to cardiac arrest and irreversible brain injury if the ventricular rhythm is not restored within 3-4 minutes. This condition can result from severe sinoatrial block or arrest (stoppage of the SA node, or pacemaker), or by third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (which also causes blockage of the heart’s beat) without a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm (a junctional or escape rhythm would carry on the beat of the heart, saving the animal from cardiac arrest.)   Symptoms and Types        Severe systemic illness or cardiac disease in many patients     Other cardiac arrhythmias in some     Syncope (fainting)     Cardiac arrest (the heart stops momentarily)     Collapse     Sudden death    Causes        A complete AV block with absence of ventricular or junctional escape rhythm     Severe sinus arrest or block     Hyperkalemia     Any severe systemic illness or heart disease predisposes     Under-active adrenal glands causing high potassium levels in the blood predisposes     Bursting of the urinary bladder or urinary tract blockage causing high potassium levels in the blood    Diagnosis   Once the initial emergency has been managed, your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your doctor can then perform a complete physical exam on your cat. Initially, just an electrolyte panel may be taken to determine if your cat has high serum potassium, which is a leading cause for ventricular standstill. This will be followed by standard laboratory tests, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis. Systemic disease as an underlying cause of heart disease must be ruled out. Additional diagnostics will include aelectrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording, which can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).   Treatment   This is an emergency situation requiring aggressive treatment.  Your veterinarian will perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation to begin your cat's heart beat and will want to make sure that your cat's heart rate is strong and consistent before going forward.  Any treatable problems, such as hypothermia, hyperkalemia, or acid-base disorders will be treated.   If primary heart disease is suspected, an echocardiogram (ECHO), a sonographic tool,  can be used to visually monitor the heart's ability to pump blood, the pattern of blood flow, and to look for tissue damage. Chest X-rays will also be taken to look for any abnormalities in the thoracic (chest) structure. The patient should be closely and frequently monitored with an ECG.   Living and Management   Unfortunately, patients with this condition have a poor prognosis. Even when sinus rhythm is re-established, the prognosis is still usually guarded to poor, as it is not uncommon for the patient to undergo cardiac arrest again.", and Types        Severe systemic illness or cardiac disease in many patients     Other cardiac arrhythmias in some     Syncope (fainting)     Cardiac arrest (the heart stops momentarily)     Collapse     Sudden death    
20,Vascular Ring Anomalies in Cats,"Persistent Right Aortic Arch in Cats

Vascular ring anomalies occur when a congenital abnormality of the heart's blood vessels result in the esophagus being compressed at the level of the base of the heart. This, in turn, prevents solid food from being able to pass properly past the compression as well as the dilatation of the esophagus in front of the compressed area. This is termed megaesophagus. Because food is not moved properly through the esophagus, regurgitation occurs.

Symptoms and Types


    Regurgitation of      undigested solid food in young cats (less than 6 months of age)
    Malnourishment
    Aspiration pneumonia      resulting in coughing, increased heart rate and heavy breathing


Time between eating and regurgitation varies.

Causes

The cause for vascular ring anomalies in cats is a developmental congenital abnormality.

Diagnosis

A thorough physical examination and routine blood testing is usually performed. However, imaging is usually necessary for accurate diagnosis. Imaging may include thoracic radiographs (X-rays), contrast esophagography (usually performed with barium), fluoroscopy and/or angiography.

 

Treatment

Cats with aspiration pneumonia may require antibiotics and possibly oxygen supplementation. Surgery to repair the vascular entrapment is indicated. However, the esophagus may be permanently compromised resulting from the entrapment itself, especially if surgical intervention does not take place early enough. In these cases, specialized feeding for megaesophagus (i.e. placing food on an elevated surface or feeding with the cat sitting upright, feeding food processed into a slurry) may be necessary indefinitely."," and Types

21,Vaginitis (Vaginal Inflammation) in Cats,"What Is Vaginitis in Cats?
Vaginitis is inflammation (swelling) and often an infection of the vagina and vulva in females. Though the condition is commonly seen in dogs, it can also occur in cats. Vaginitis can be very uncomfortable for your cat, often causing pain during urination. Left untreated, these infections can also spread to the bladder, kidneys, or even the uterus if your cat isn’t spayed.

Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible if you notice any swelling or inflammation in the vaginal area.

Symptoms of Vaginitis in Cats
As with all illnesses in cats, vaginitis can be difficult to diagnose at home. Some common symptoms include:


	
	Scooting or rubbing the back end on floors or other surfaces
	
	
	Excessive grooming under the tail/around the vulva
	
	
	Urinating frequently, usually smaller amounts
	
	
	Urinating in inappropriate locations
	
	
	Discharge from the vulva
	
	
	Redness and swelling under the tail
	


Causes of Vaginitis in Cats
The most common cause of vaginitis in cats is a decrease in proper grooming, which can lead to the collection of feces or even urine in the fur around the vulva. This is most apparent in obese cats who cannot bend to groom their back ends and often have extra folds of skin around the rectum and vagina that trap material. Cats with severe arthritis may also be unable to groom properly and be more susceptible. 

Less common causes of vaginitis are:


	
	Trauma to the vulva or anal area
	
	
	Allergic disease
	
	
	Urinary tract infections
	
	
	Tumors of the vagina or anal area
	


Unlike in humans, fungal infections of the vagina (like a yeast infection) in cats are extremely rare.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Vaginitis in Cats
Vaginitis is most often diagnosed by visual inspection of your cat’s vulva combined with clinical signs. The harder part for your veterinarian is figuring out the cause. The following diagnostics may be recommended to find the root of the problem:


	
	Urinalysis or urine culture to check for infection or other abnormalities of the urinary tract
	
	
	Blood chemistry and complete blood count to look for kidney disease or other organ dysfunction
	
	
	X-rays or ultrasound to look for physical abnormalities like bladder stones
	
	
	Skin culture of the vagina or vulva (particularly in cases that don’t respond well to therapy)
	
	
	Biopsy in severe cases or when tumors are suspected
	


Treatment of Vaginitis in Cats
Because there are many possible causes of vaginitis, treatment will vary depending on the underlying cause. Hospitalization is rarely necessary. Systemic (full-body) antibiotics are often needed for bacterial infections of the vagina or bladder. In some cases, steroids or pain medications may be used to decrease the inflammation.

As cats tend to lick at regions that are uncomfortable, an e-collar or cone should be used to allow the vaginitis to heal without disruption. It is important to avoid over-the-counter treatments for human vaginitis, because this disease is different in cats and these treatments may be toxic. Your veterinarian can prescribe you appropriate products to help keep the area clean while your cat cannot groom.

Recovery and Management of Vaginitis in Cats
Superficial surface inflammation usually responds to medication within 1-2 weeks. Deeper infections may take a month or so to resolve. Follow-up exams with your veterinarian will be important, because your cat’s behavior may improve before the underlying inflammation is resolved. If treatment is stopped before the inflammation is under control, the vaginitis may recur.

Once treated, the likelihood of recurrence depends on the cause of the vaginitis. Uncomplicated cases, such as trauma that can be surgically repaired or vaginitis from matted fur (if it can be easily removed), are very unlikely to recur. When the underlying disease is complex or requires lengthy treatment, your cat may have more episodes before things are fully managed. Obesity, arthritis, and allergies are manageable, but they take time to treat. It may even take more than one course of treatment to figure out the underlying cause.

22,Vaginal Discharge in Cats,"Vaginal discharge refers to any substance (mucus, blood, pus) excreted by the cat's vagina. Because there are so many causes for this medical condition, consulting a veterinarian is highly recommended.



Vaginal discharge can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.



Symptoms



Symptoms can include discharge (mucus, blood, pus) from the cat's vagina, spotting of blood, scooting of the hindquarters, and a higher incidence of male attraction.



Causes



There are many risk factors which can lead to vaginal discharge; some of the more common causes include:




	Vaginal trauma
	Vaginal infection
	Urinary tract infection
	Abnormal cells in the vaginal area
	Retained placenta following a birthing
	Fetal death (in cases of pregnant females)
	Presence of a foreign object in the vaginal cavity




Estrogen medications given during some phases of the cat's heat or estrous cycle, medications containing male hormones and certain antibiotics can alter the vaginal cells, leading to excess discharge. There are also some antibiotics which can cause vaginal discharge.



Diagnosis



Upon examination, the veterinarian may find blood, pus, urine or feces in abnormal quantities. The veterinarian will need to review the cat's medical history and make a risk assessment. In order to properly treat the condition, radiograph or injection imaging may be used to examine the cat's body to identify the underlying medical condition causing the vaginal discharge.





Treatment



Outpatient treatment is sufficient under most circumstances. Medications in the form of vaginal douches and cat antibiotics will be used to treat the infected area.



Living and Management



The entire round of antibiotic treatment must be completed to ensure a full recovery.



Prevention



Spaying can help to reduce the likelihood of vaginal infections. For birthing cats, make sure that all of the uterine contents have left the cat's body, and be observant of excess blood or discharge after the birth.","



Symptoms can include discharge (mucus, blood, pus) from the cat's vagina, spotting of blood, scooting of the hindquarters, and a higher incidence of male attraction.

23,Vaginal Abnormalities in Cats,"Vaginal Malformations and Acquired Lesions in Cats
 
An altered or abnormal anatomic vaginal architecture, or vaginal malformation, can be due to congenital anomalies such as an imperforate hymen (where the hymen is solid, not allowing fluids through the vaginal canal from the uterus, or normal penetration [such as for breeding]; generally a congenital anomaly); dorsoventral septum (or septae, where the vagina has a vertical dividing membranous wall/partition); hymenal tightening; cysts (a sac with liquid inside); or to acquired conditions such as vaginal overgrowth, foreign bodies, strictures (tightenings), adhesions (abnormal fibrous tissue sticking to the structures), and cancer.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Vulvar discharge
    Excessive licking of the vulva
    Frequent or inappropriate urination
    Straining to urinate or defecate
    Wetting in the house, in the bed, etc.
    Attractive to males
    Refuses mating
    Mass at lips of the vulva
    Skin disorder around the vulva
    Abnormally small vulva

 
Causes


    Congenital
    Inflammatory
    Hormonal
    Traumatic
    Cancerous

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. The urinalysis may show evidence of a secondary urinary tract infection. After the initial examination, your veterinarian will perform a gynecological examination as well.
 
The order in which the procedures are performed is important. They are listed here in the recommended order:


    Vaginal culture to identify secondary infections
    Vaginal cytology (cell examination) to identify stage of the estrous cycle; reveal inflammatory or cancerous cells
    Digital examination (with a finger) of the vaginal canal
    Vaginoscopy: an examination of the internal structure of the vagina using a small camera
    Vaginography: X-rays performed after special dyes have been placed in the vaginal canal, so that the shape and structure of the vagina can be better viewed as the dye fills the vaginal space
    Ultrasonography will be done when the results of the previous procedures suggest an anatomic abnormality

 
Positive-contrast Vaginography

    Defines the structural boundaries of the vagina
    Defines the structural boundaries of the cervix
    Identifies strictures (narrowings), septae (partitions), persistent hymens, masses, rectum to vagina or urethra to vagina fistulas (abnormal connecting passageways between two normally separate canals), vaginal rupture, and diverticula (outpouching of hollow or fluid filled sac like structure)
    Urinary incontinence may require excretory urography (X-rays of urination with dyes) to rule out ectopic (abnormally positioned) ureters (the tubes running from the kidneys down to the bladder), or a bladder  with its neck positioned in the pelvis

 
Abdominal ultrasonography

    Cranial vaginal masses may occasionally be imaged
    Fluid buildup in the vagina (hydrocolpos) or uterus (hydrometra) may be seen in cases of imperforate hymen, due to solid structure of hymen blocking the flow of fluids from the uterus

 
Treatment
 
Manual dilation of closed hymens or of a mild vaginal narrowing may be performed over a course of several treatments while using an anesthetic on the cat. It usually reduces the medical issue, although it does not resolve clinical signs. Surgery can be used to correct many minor congenital and acquired lesions. Spaying to resolve clinical signs -- typically exhibited during estrus (heat) -- can be performed in patients with no breeding value. Removal of the vagina and ovariohysterectomy can be performed in patients with no breeding value to resolve concurrent severe vaginitis (at all stages of the estrous cycle).
 
Living and Management
 
Although it is very rare, there are occasionally cases in which an animal is diagnosed with a vaginal malformation that has been passed on as a genetic trait. If several cats in a familial line show similar clinical signs of vaginal malformations, they should all be spayed to prevent the trait from being passed on to the next litter. Some animals with vaginal malformations that are not familial may be bred by artificial insemination. They may then give birth via a planned cesarean section."," and Types

24,Vacuolar Hepatopathy in Cats,"Steroid Related Liver Disease in Cats 
 
Vacuolar hepatopathy causes liver cells (hepatocytes) to undergo reversible vacuolar changes due to glycogen accumulation. The storage form of glucose, glycogen accumulates in liver cells because of steroid medication overuse, an overproduction of steroids in the body, or due to an endocrine disorder (e.g., hyperadrenocorticism, atypical adrenal hyperplasia).
 
Vacuolar hepatopathy is rare in cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms are ultimately based on the underlying cause of the hepatopathy; some of the more common signs include:
 

    Panting
    Lethargy
    Loss of hair (alopecia)
    Increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria)
    Increased appetite (polyphagia)
    Abdominal distention
    Muscle weakness
    Bruises on skin
    Friable (easily crumbled) skin

 
Although it is rare, the cat may demonstrate symptoms of liver failure.
 
Causes
 

    Drug administration (e.g., glucocorticoids)
    Hyperadrenocorticism
    Atypical adrenal hyperplasia
    Chronic infections
    Cancer
    Congenital

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which will depend on the underlying cause of the condition.
 
Blood testing, for example, may reveal anemia, abnormally high number of red blood cells (polycythemia), increased number of leukocytes or white blood cells, and abnormally high number platelets (thrombocytosis). Biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may reveal abnormal levels of liver enzymes, high levels of albumin (blood protein), and bilirubin, and abnormally high levels of cholesterol.
 
Your veterinarian will conduct the abdominal X-rays to identify the size of the liver, and thoracic X-rays to determine the size of lymph nodes, or metastasis, in the case of tumor(s) and cardiac or pulmonary disorders. Abdominal ultrasound, meanwhile, may reveal enlarged liver and changes in liver tissue due to extensive lesions and other concurrent problems within abdominal cavity.
 
There are also other, more specific and sensitive tests available to evaluate the liver, thyroid gland, and pituitary gland functions. Your veterinarian may take a live tissue sample to be sent to veterinary pathologist for further evaluation, often revealing the presence of vacuoles within liver cells and changes related to this abnormal accumulation. In addition, liver biopsies help in ruling out other liver diseases.
 
If infection is suspected, your veterinarian will take the sample to be sent to laboratory for culture and sensitivity. Culturing the sample helps in growing and identifying the causative organisms and sensitivity provide information related to antibiotics most effective against isolated organisms.

 


Treatment
 
The course of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the disease. However, due to reversible nature of this condition, early treatment will usually completely resolve the problem.
 
If pituitary masses are present, radiation therapy is used to destroy these masses within pituitary glands. Tumor(s) may also be excised surgically. In case of dental disease, proper antibiotics are used to control the infection. In case of infections, proper antibiotics are used to control and treat infections after culture and sensitivity testing. And in cases of underactive thyroid glands (hypothyroidism), thyroxine supplementation is required.
 


Living and Management
 
The cat will require regular follow-up exams following treatment to evaluate the animal its liver function. Your veterinarian will also often recommend modifying the cat's diet, especially if it has developed pacreatitis, which will require a low-fat diet.
 
Prognosis depends on the extent of disease; in some patients, prognosis is poor despite treatment."," and Types
 
Symptoms are ultimately based on the underlying cause of the hepatopathy; some of the more common signs include:
 

    Panting
    Lethargy
    Loss of hair (alopecia)

    Increased appetite (polyphagia)
    Abdominal distention
    Muscle weakness

25,Uveitis in Cats,"What Is Uveitis in Cats?
Uveitis in cats is an inflammation of the uvea (also known as the uveal tract), which is a part of the eye that includes the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid.


	
	Iris. The iris is the colored portion of your cat’s eye directly surrounding the pupil. The job of the iris is to control the size of the pupil, which helps determine the amount of light that’s allowed to reach the retina (eye lining that translates light signals to the brain).
	
	
	Ciliary Body. The ciliary body is the middle layer of the eye that connects the two other parts of the uvea (the iris and the choroid). Its muscles help the eye focus by changing the size of the pupil and the lens shape. The ciliary body produces fluid, called aqueous humor, which provides oxygen and nutrients to the lens and the cornea (clear, outermost cover of the eye).
	
	
	Choroid. The choroid is a vascular layer (full of vessels) of the eye that contains melanin cells (natural skin pigment). These cells absorb light, limit reflection, and protect the blood vessels against light toxicity (too much light). The choroid’s melanin cells also provide oxygen and blood supply to the outer retina.
	


 

Symptoms of Uveitis in Cats
Eye conditions in cats tend to be sneaky, and uveitis is no different. That’s because cats are good at hiding their illnesses and may simply hide more when they aren’t feeling their best or are in pain.

Cat uveitis can have an acute or sudden onset, or it can develop slowly and remain undetected for some time.

Because uveitis can cause blindness, the only thing you may notice is your cat’s sudden disappearance, as this condition would certainly be alarming to them and cause them to retreat.

If you do notice physical signs, either one or both of your cat’s eyes can be affected. Most often, a notably “red eye” is seen. Your cat may squint, appear to be sensitive to light, and have a watery eye. This is because uveitis is painful.

The color of your cat’s iris may be altered or cloudy. Pupil size may be affected, along with your cat’s vision, though this can be harder to detect. If glaucoma (buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve) accompanies the uveitis, your cat’s eye may be enlarged or seem to stick out.

If a generalized infection or virus is involved in uveitis, your cat may act ill and show other clinical signs depending upon the particular issue.

Causes of Cat Uveitis
There are two general categories for causes of cat uveitis:


	
	Ocular, or having to do with the eye
	
	
	Systemic causes
	


Ocular Causes of Uveitis in Cats

Ocular causes include:


	
	Tears on the surface of the eye or within the cornea (the outermost cover of the eye), called corneal ulcers
	
	
	Trauma to the eye
	
	
	Cataracts (clouding of the eye lens)
	
	
	Tumors
	


Systemic Causes of Uveitis in Cats

Systemic causes of cat uveitis are extensive. They include noninfectious systemic causes and various infectious causes. In addition, there are some cases of uveitis that are immune-mediated.

Noninfectious causes:


	
	High blood pressure
	
	
	Eating fatty foods
	


Infectious causes:


	
	Feline infectious peritonitis, also known as FIP (viral)  
	
	
	Feline immunodeficiency virus, also known as FIV (viral)
	
	
	Histoplasmosis (fungal)
	
	
	Blastomycosis (fungal)
	
	
	Cryptococcosis (fungal)
	
	
	Coccidioidomycosis (fungal)
	
	
	Candidiasis (fungal)
	
	
	Toxoplasmosis (parasitic)
	
	
	Cuterebra larval migration (parasitic)
	


Immune-mediated causes:


	
	Drug reactions
	
	
	Vaccine reactions
	
	
	Toxins
	
	
	Other systemic disease processes
	


Unfortunately, immune-mediated disease is difficult to understand and sometimes difficult to attribute to an underlying cause. Medications that change the functioning of the immune system are usually started to treat the clinical signs. 

If a systemic cause (such as infection) is not determined to be affecting the immune system, then often a cause for the uveitis is never diagnosed. This is called idiopathic uveitis.

How Vets Diagnose Cat Uveitis
Your veterinarian will want to know if your cat has experienced any other physical symptoms at home (such as weight loss, decreased appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea), as well as details about your cat’s home environment and exposure to other animals.

In addition to a complete physical examination, your veterinarian will perform an ophthalmic exam. Your vet will likely also recommend specific eye tests to evaluate the surface of the cornea for any abrasions, measure eye pressure, and measure tear production.

Basic blood work may also be necessary, as well as tests to rule out any infections that may have caused the uveitis. Some of these tests may include:


	
	Complete blood count
	
	
	Biochemistry panel
	
	
	Feline leukemia test
	
	
	FIV test
	
	
	Toxoplasmosis test
	


Treatment for Uveitis in Cats
Treatment of uveitis includes therapy targeted at the specific causes, if they can be identified, as well as generalized therapy.

Specific therapy may include medications for high blood pressure, for instance. For noncurable infectious causes, such as FIV, treatment is aimed at reducing your cat’s symptoms and supporting them through their flare-ups.

Your vet may prescribe topical eye medications and systemic medications to alleviate pain and decrease inflammation. Examples of these include:


	
	Atropine
	
	
	Prednisolone acetate
	
	
	Topical NSAIDs
	


In the case of tumors in the eye, surgery will likely be necessary.

Recovery and Management of Cat Uveitis
Many cases of feline uveitis are resolved via a veterinary visit for a thorough examination, diagnostic testing, and medication therapy. Your cat will have a follow-up visit for the vet to assess healing and resolution of the condition. 

Other cats are less fortunate and will require months of treatment. Cats with fungal infections typically require lengthy treatment, as the underlying fungal cause can be difficult to eliminate.

As with all eye conditions, recheck visits for uveitis in cats are essential to gauge the effectiveness of treatment and monitor the progression of your cat’s healing.

You will also need to monitor your cat at home to make sure their symptoms don’t come back, as uveitis can result in blindness or the loss of the eye when left untreated.
Uveitis in Cats FAQsIs uveitis contagious in cats?Not typically, although a few types of cat uveitis may be associated with infectious diseases that have the potential to spread.

26,UTIs in Cats (Urinary Tract Infections in Cats),"What Are Urinary Tract Infections in Cats?
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not common in cats. Only 1-3% of cats with signs of urinary tract disease will have a urinary tract infection.

Because they can resemble so many other conditions, UTIs need to be distinguished from other conditions, such as crystals in the urine. Fortunately, by running some simple tests, your veterinarian will be able to tell the difference.

In most cases, UTIs in cats are usually caused by bacteria. Bacterial urinary tract infections in cats are generally relatively easy to treat and respond well to medications. Chronic infections, or those that do not respond to regular medication, can require more testing to figure out why your cat is at higher risk for urinary tract infections.

Symptoms of Urinary Tract Infections in Cats
Most cats with urinary tract infections will make frequent trips to the litter box and seem restless. They may go into the box and strain to pee but produce either a small amount of urine or no urine at all. Occasionally, their urine may appear bloody.

Some cats will avoid the litter box because they have associated it with the discomfort caused by the UTI. Instead, they may urinate in other places in your home. Sinks, bathtubs, and clean laundry are popular spots. Your cat also may vomit and seem lethargic as the problem progresses—especially male cats.

In most cases, acute (sudden) and chronic urinary tract infections will cause very similar symptoms. However, some cats with the chronic form show no signs of disease.

Causes of Urinary Tract Infections in Cats
Both sudden and chronic urinary tract infections are caused by bacterial infections. The bacteria involved in UTIs usually come from either the gastrointestinal tract or lower down the urinary/reproductive tract. If your cat is older or has other medical conditions, they are more likely to develop bacterial urinary tract problems.

How Vets Diagnose UTIs in Cats
Vets diagnose urinary tract infections by collecting a urine sample and examining it for the presence of bacteria. These samples must be collected through a process called cystocentesis, where urine is drawn directly from the bladder with a fine needle. This is necessary to prevent contamination of the urine sample from cups, tables, or any other surface the urine may come into contact with.

After cystocentesis, your veterinarian will run a culture-and-sensitivity test. During this test, the bacteria are isolated and studied. This helps the vet determine the best antibiotics for your cat’s exact infection.

Occasionally, acute infections—especially first-time infections that show up suddenly—are treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic without trying to determine which bacteria are involved.

Chronic infections, however, almost always require more testing to isolate the type of bacteria causing the problem and identify the best antibiotic.

Treatment for UTIs in Cats
If you see any signs of UTI in your cat, take them to the vet. For male cats, it can be fatal to wait even a few hours. For female cats, feed them canned food only and see the vet within 24 hours. You should not try to treat the UTI at home with things like cranberry products, which have not been proven to be effective for UTIs in cats.

Urinary tract infections in cats are usually treated with antibiotics. Often, vets also recommend feeding an all-canned diet for a period of time (or long-term) since dry foods often result in a more-concentrated urine, which can lead to urinary tract problems.

If your cat is particularly uncomfortable, your vet may prescribe anti-inflammatory pain medication—especially if treatment is delayed a few days while you wait for test results. Acute infections usually receive a relatively short course of antibiotics, while chronic UTIs may require longer antibiotic use.

Recovery and Management of UTIs in Cats
Most cats will fully recover within 7-10 days of developing a urinary tract infection, but they may need to remain on a canned diet for longer. Your vet may check a urine sample after treatment to determine if all the bacteria are gone.

Occasionally, cats will develop repeated urinary tract infections. Cats with recurring UTIs often require more testing to determine the underlying cause.
UTIs in Cats FAQsHow can I treat my cat’s UTI at home?In most cases, vet treatment should be sought promptly if you suspect your cat has a urinary tract infections. In male cats, waiting even a few hours for treatment can prove fatal. In females, changing to an all-canned diet is a good start while you wait for your veterinary appointment, which should be scheduled within a few days of noticing symptoms.

Generally, after the veterinary appointment, you can take care of your cat at home with one or more prescribed medications and a canned-food diet.
Can I give my cat cranberry juice for a UTI?Although there are products marketed for cats containing cranberry and labeled as treatments for urinary tract infections, research has not found them to be effective. In fact, changing the pH of your cat’s urine, which cranberry often does, may lead to unwanted complications, including crystals and stones. It is not recommended to use cranberry juice or cranberry products to treat UTIs in cats.
Can cats get UTIs from a dirty litter box?Some cats will try to hold their urine rather than use a dirty box, much like how people may choose not to use a filthy porta-potty. Holding in urine has the potential to cause urinary tract diseases, including urinary tract infections.
Can a cat UTI go away by itself?A healthy cat with a strong immune system may fight off a mild UTI that doesn’t have symptoms. If you see any symptoms, your cat likely requires treatment and should see the vet.  
How long can a cat UTI go untreated?If your cat is male and showing symptoms of a UTI, he should go to the vet immediately. 

In female cats, if there are clinical signs, such as straining to urinate, urinating outside of the litter box, frequent smaller urinations, or blood in the urine, for longer than 1-2 days, she should go to the vet. UTIs can be quite uncomfortable and, if left untreated, may move into the kidneys (termed pyelonephritis) and cause infection throughout the body.

27,Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats,"What Are Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats?
Bladder stones and crystals are solid waste particles that form in a cat’s urine.

Waste materials can be concentrated inside of the bladder, resulting in stones or crystals. This is especially common if a cat is dehydrated or eating primarily dry food.

These crystals can only be seen under a microscope, but over time they can get bigger, and eventually can become stones as big as the bladder itself.

Stones or crystals can be found in the kidneys in the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder (ureter), in the bladder itself, or in the tube that connects the bladder to the outside of the body (urethra).

Crystals and stones have the potential to change the flow of urine, and can result in kidney damage or a complete urinary blockage, which can be fatal in cats.

What Is the Difference Between Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats?

Crystals are the building blocks of bladder stones.

There are different types of crystals and stones that can form depending on various factors, such as the acidity of the urine, the concentration of the urine, genetic factors, diet, and other conditions.

It's also possible to have a stone that is made up of more than one type.

Types of Urine Crystals and Stones in Cats


	
	Struvite—Also called magnesium ammonium phosphate stones, struvite is one of the two most common stones in cats. This is due to a multitude of factors such as breed, sex, and diet.

	
		
		Struvite crystals and stones are extremely common, especially in cats that eat primarily dry food. Magnesium ammonium phospahate causes these (commonly known as “ash” in pet foods).
		
		
		Although the disease caused by this type of crystal is most severe in male cats, female cats can also be affected.
		
		
		Sometimes these can be dissolved out with a prescription diet, but occasionally surgery is required. Often, they can be prevented by feeding a cat an exclusively canned food diet.
		
	
	
	
	Calcium oxalate—This forms from the combination of calcium waste and oxalate waste in the urine, and are most common in middle-aged, older, neutered, male cats, or in Persian or Himalayan breeds.

	
		
		Calcium oxalate are another type of crystal and stone that are commonly seen in cats. These are much more stubborn than struvites, often requiring surgery.

Symptoms of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
Symptoms of bladder cystals or stones in cats include:


	
	Small, frequent urinations
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	“Accidents” outside of the litter box—especially places like sinks or laundry
	
	
	Bloody urine
	


Signs your male cat may be experiencing a urinary emergency:


	
	Frequent trips to the litter box with little or no urine produced
	
	
	Straining with little to no urine produced
	
	
	Crying, restlessness
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Vomiting
	


While symptoms seen in bladder crystals and stones are similar, symptoms of bladder stones tend to go on longer than crystals.

Causes of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
There are several different reasons a cat may develop crystals and stones, including underlying health conditions, breed, and age. 

However, in the vast majority of cases (particularly of the common struvite crystals/stones), a dry food diet plays a large role. 

The underlying cause of calcium oxalate crystals/stones are less precise, but diet still plays a major part. Some cats don’t tolerate urine that is heavily saturated with calcium and/or oxalate as well, resulting in crystal formation. This is why long-term management involves specially designed (prescription only, there are no over-the-counter alternatives) diets which are meant to adjust the levels of waste products below levels that will form crystals. 

Because most cats don’t drink much water, they tend to be chronically dehydrated, which also contributes to formation of both types of common crystals or stones. This is why wet food is preferred.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
Diagnosis of a stone, crystals, or a blockage includes the following diagnostic tests performed by your vet:


	
	Bloodwork—To look for underlying conditions that may cause certain crystals or stones, or to evaluate the presence/severity of a blockage
	
	
	Urinalysis—To evaluate the urine environment including the concentration of the urine, the acidity or non-acidity of the urine, and the presence of infection or crystals
	
	
	Imaging—This includes X-rays or ultrasound to visually look for stones
	


Treatment of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
Treatment of crystals/stones depends on the type of crystal/stone, the size and location of the stone, and your cat’s history.

Female cats are often able to pass small stones, either on their own or with a flushing procedure called voiding urohydropropulsion.

Male cats, however, are at higher risk for a urinary blockage, even with very small stones. Their urethra is constricted because the stone/crystal needs to travel through their penis. This forms a bottleneck where the stones/crystal become jammed up and causes an obstruction. 

Some stones are dissolvable within two-to-four weeks of starting a prescription diet. However, larger stones can dissolve to a small enough size that they can also cause a urinary blockage. Stones must be removed surgically if they are too big and not able to dissolve. Most calcium oxalate stones will not be dissolved by prescription diet and require surgical removal.

A urinary blockage typically requires several days of hospitalization to stabilize your cat, and one-to-two weeks for a full recovery. If a stone is blocking the flow of urine, your vet will insert a catheter to flush the stone back to the bladder. Then, the stone must either be dissolved or surgically removed to prevent another blockage.

Recovery and Management of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
Your cat’s recovery from urine crystals and bladder stones depends on the type of stone and your cat’s health history.

Diet is the most common management strategy since there are several commercial diets designed to treat and/or prevent the most common types of crystals/stones. Increasing water intake is another strategy, as crystal/stone formation is more likely in concentrated urine. Feeding canned food is an efficient way to also increase water intake.

Prevention of Urine Crystals and Bladder Stones in Cats
It’s important to realize that crystals and stones in cat urine can recur.

First, if your cat has already had crystals/stones, increase their water intake, and feed them the specific diet recommended by your veterinarian. Do not feed them any other foods—discuss any changes to your cat’s diet with your veterinarian first. 

Diluting your cat’s prescription food with other diets, treats, or snacks can lead to a recurrence of the problem. These foods are carefully adjusted to provide exactly the right urine concentration to prevent crystals/stones.

A recheck urinalysis will also help you to know if a problem is developing before symptoms start. Be sure the sample is fresh, as struvite crystals can develop in older urine that’s been left out.

If your cat has not had an issue, feeding an all-canned quality diet is the best way to help prevent formation of urine crystals and bladder stones. Encourage your cat to drink a lot of water by using water fountains, running water, or flavor their water with a little bit of tuna juice.

28,Urinating Outside the Litter Box and Wandering Away from Home in Cats,"Spraying and Roaming Behavior



Cats communicate with each other in various ways. One of the primary ways is through scent. Each cat's urine and feces (stool) has a unique scent, so that when a cat urinates or defecates in a specific location, it is communicating with other cats that may come along later. This behavior is referred to as territory marking, and these marked spots “tell” other cats which cat has been to this spot and claimed that area or object as its territory. Another type of marking behavior, referred to as spraying, is distinguished by urinating on walls, furniture, or other upright surfaces.



Cats first begin marking territory as they become mature. For male cats this occurs around puberty, and for female cats it occurs around the time they go into estrus (heat) for the first time. When cats reach the age of puberty or estrus, they also become more likely to stray from home. This is called roaming. Cats will roam to find mates, to explore, and to mark their territory. Cats that are intact are more likely to mark territory and to roam than cats that are neutered or spayed.



Symptoms and Types



Marking


	Cat urinates or defecates in a specific area that it has chosen
	Owner may not approve of the chosen area
	Urinating or defecating outside the litter box
	Urinating or defecating near doors or windows
	Can occur on a horizontal surface, such as the ground
	Can occur on vertical or upright surface, such as a wall or furniture (spraying)




Roaming


	Wandering away from home




Causes




	Can be normal behavior or cab be caused by another disease
	Hormones make cats more likely to mark and roam
	Cats learn some marking and roaming behavior



	Marking
	
		A need to define a territory
		A need to communicate with other cats
		Bladder infection
		Anxiety
		Diarrhea or constipation
		Diseases of the anal sacs (scent glands near the anus)
		Litter box not kept clean enough
		Preference for another kind of litter
		Stray outdoor cats near doors and windows (causing your cat to want to join them)
		Multiple cats in household
	
	



	Roaming
	
		A desire to explore territory
		A need to find a mate
		A need for more food
		A need to mark territory
		Separation anxiety 
	
	




Diagnosis



You will need to provide a complete medical and behavioral history leading up to the onset of your cat's marking and roaming behavior. Along with a thorough physical examination, your veterinarian will order the standard tests: a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis. These tests will help your doctor to determine whether there is an underlying medical condition, such as a bladder infection, which might be causing your cat's symptoms. Further tests may include a blood thyroid test to make sure that your cat's thyroid level is normal, and fecal (stool) tests to rule out intestinal parasites or nutritional deficiency.



If the urine analysis shows that your cat has a bladder infection, your veterinarian may order a culture of the urine and x-rays of your cat's bladder. The culture will show exactly what bacteria are causing the bladder infection, and x-ray images will show the presence of bladder stones, or other bladder problems, which might be causing the bladder infection.



If you have a female cat that is not spayed, your veterinarian may also do a vaginal cytology, a lab analysis of the cells in the vagina so that the stage of estrus (heat) she is in can be determined. If all of these tests return normal, your cat will be diagnosed with a behavioral problem.







Treatment



If a medical problem is found that is causing your cat to mark territory excessively, or roam away from home, this problem will be treated first. This alone may help decrease some of the behavior. If your cat is not spayed or neutered, your veterinarian will recommend spaying or neutering unless you have plans to breed your cat. This often helps to decrease roaming and marking behavior. If your cat has been diagnosed with a behavioral problem, your veterinarian will help to guide you through a plan to change that behavior (behavioral modification therapy). This plan will typically involve changes to your daily routine with your cat.



If you are having a problem with your cat roaming, you will need to keep it indoors all of the time. Provide toys and scratching posts to keep your cat busy while it is indoors, and as much as possible provide activities for your cat to spend its energy. If your cat is roaming because of separation anxiety or fear, your veterinarian will help you to come up with a behavior modification program to help your cat deal with its anxiety. In some cases, medication may be necessary to help your cat get over this problem and respond to the training.



If your cat has a persistent problem with marking, it may help to keep other animals away from your house and yard. If your cat is urinating or defecating outside of the litter box, you may need to change the type of litter that you use, or change the location of the litter box. Some cats prefer a finer grain of litter, and some cannot tolerate scented litters. Keeping the litter box clean on a daily basis is an important and often overlooked part of cat care. Cats do not like to step onto their own waste, and some will outright refuse to use a soiled litter box. Scooping urine and feces out of the litter box daily, and giving the box a thorough cleaning once a week will help your cat to feel comfortable using it. In the areas where your cat has urinated or defecated outside of the litter box, you will need to clean with a special cleaner that will remove the odors entirely, or your cat will return to those areas again and again. Even after cleaning, you should prevent your cat from going into those areas again. Another option is to use synthetic animal pheromones in the home to dissuade your cat from marking. These man-made versions of natural cat smells may cause your cat to think that the territory has already been marked and will not mark them again with its own urine. You veterinarian can tell you more about this and other options that will stop your cat's marking behavior.



Living and Management



When you first begin behavioral modification therapy, your veterinarian will want to check your progress regularly. This is to address any issues that might have come up and to make sure that you and your cat are doing well with the planned therapy. If your cat is on medication for anxiety, you will need to return to the veterinarian’s office for follow-up complete blood counts and biochemistry levels to make sure the medication is not damaging any of your cat's internal organs.



Because marking and roaming are normal cat behaviors, they may take some time to change and to stop entirely. Your dedication to the behavioral training will be the crucial determinant for a successful outcome. Keep in mind the importance of training your cat to be comfortable with staying indoors: when roaming, your cat could be in a fight or could be hit by a car, or it could be harmed or stolen by people who chance upon it.



The most common reasons people give their cats up to animal shelters is because of urinating or defecating in the home. The stress that this behavior brings into the home makes behavioral training essential. Keep in mind that patience and positive reinforcement go a long way as you train your cat to change its behavior for you.



Whatever treatment plan you and your veterinarian come up with, this is the plan that will need to be followed consistently for the rest of your cat's life. This will keep your cat from returning to the inappropriate behavior. If your cat is being treated for anxiety, it may need to be on medication for a long time. Some cat's can eventually be weaned off medication, while other's anxiety issues may not be resolved as easily.



Prevention



Spaying female cats before their first heat cycle, and neutering male cats before they reach puberty can prevent a lot of inappropriate behaviors. Keep your cats indoors and provide plenty of toys to keep it active, and scoop all litter boxes daily, with thorough cleanings once a week."," and Types

29,Urinary Tract Stones/Crystals Made Up Of Uric Acid in Cats,"Urolithiasis/Urate Stones in Cats

Urolithiasis is a medical term referring to the presence of stones or crystals in a cat's urinary tract. When the stones are made up of uric acid, they are called urate stones. These stones can also be found in the kidneys and in the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder (ureters).

While these stones can affect any cat breed, the condition does tend to be more common in male animals than in females. It is typically noticed within the first three to four years of life.

It is highly likely the stones will recur after treatment, but the overall prognosis for a treated cat is positive.

Symptoms and Types

While many cats will not show any signs of the disease, the most common symptoms usually deal with urination issues. These can include abnormal urine streams, difficulty urinating (dysuria), blood in the urine (hematuria), cloudy urine, and eventually the complete inability to urinate (anuria).

Causes

Cats that have an abnormal connection of the main blood vessel in the liver, called a portosystemic shunt, have a higher incidence of developing these types of stones in the urinary tract. A diet consisting of high amounts of purine – found in beef, poultry and fish – can also cause this condition.

Diagnosis

Ultrasounds are often performed to determine the size, shape, and location of the stones. This information will help your veterinarian to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. Bloodwork will also be performed to determine if there are any underlying medical conditions causing the stones.

Treatment

If your cat is unable to urinate because of blockage, surgery is often the required treatment. In the event the cat has an abnormal connection of the main blood vessel in its liver – as mentioned above – surgery can be performed to re-route blood flow.

Medications are sometimes prescribed to dissolve the stones; this method takes about four weeks to completely resolve the matter.

Living and Management

To monitor for a the recurrence of stones, ultrasounds and X-rays should be performed every two to six months. If caught early, the stones are easy to treat without the need for surgery.

Prevention

A low purine diet has shown some promise in the prevention of the formation of these stones."," and Types

30,Urinary Tract / Kidney Stones (Cystine) in Cats,"Urolithiasis (Cystine) in Cats

Urolithiasis is described as the presence of stones or crystals in the urinary tract. When these stones are made of cystine -- a normal compound found in the body -- they are referred to as cystine stones. These stones can also be found in the kidneys and in the tubes connecting the kidneys to the animal's bladder (ureters).

Urolithiasis is primarily found in adult cats, and the Siamese and Domestic Shorthair breeds show the highest likelihood for cystine stone formation. Fortunately, the stones can be dissolved and removed without surgery in most cases, giving the animal a positive prognosis.

The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types

Typical symptoms can include pollakiuria, dysuria, and an abnormal flow of urine (post-renal uremia).

Causes

The exact cause for urolithiasis is not currently known. In some cats, however, the inability to process proteins or amino acids has led to the development of cystine stones.

Diagnosis

Ultrasounds and X-rays are often performed to determine the size, shape, and location of the stones, helping the veterinarian come up with an appropriate treatment regimen. A urine test can also detect the presence of stones.

In some cases, a scope with a camera on the end (urethrascope) is used to examine the inside of the urinary tract for any abnormalities.

Treatment

The veterinarian will usually recommend using treatment options such as a special diet and medication [N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine (2-MPG)] to reduce and eliminate the stones without surgery.

Living and Management

Follow all recommended dietary changes and administer prescribed medication. This will help prevent a recurrence of the stones. It is also important to bring the animal back to the veterinarian's office to ensure the stones have been successfully dissolved.

Prevention

There are currently no known preventive measures for this medical condition."," and Types

31,Urinary Tract / Kidney Stones (Calcium Phosphate) in Cats,"Calcium Phosphate Urolithiasis in Cats

When stones (uroliths) form in the urinary tract, it is referred to as urolithiasis. There are various types of these stones seen in cats -- among them, those made from calcium phosphate. Also known as apatite uroliths, calcium phosphate stones are more often found the kidneys than the urinary bladder.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms may vary depending on the location, size, and number of stones within the urinary tract. In fact, some cats display no outwardly visible signs of the issue; it is only discovered later during a routine checkup, if at all. The following are some typical symptoms associated with calcium phosphate urolithiasis:


    Increased urination (polyuria)
    Difficulty urinating (e.g., 	dribbling of urine)
    Pain when urinating
    Blood in urine


Causes


    Excessive calcium in diet
    Excessive use of mineral 	supplements (e.g., vitamin D)
    Various kidney diseases/infections


Diagnosis

After completing a complete medical history of your animal, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam on the cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Although the results of these tests may be normal, there are exceptions. In some cats, the biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood. In cats with severe kidney damage or urinary tract blockage, high levels of waste products like urea may be found in the blood.

Biochemical changes related to underlying disease are also helpful in diagnosing the underlying disease or condition. Additionally, microscopic urine examination is useful in identifying the type of stone.

Treatment

As there is no effective medications available for this type of stone, dissolution of the stone is the mainstay of treatment. Surgery may be required to remove the stones from the urinary tract, especially in cases in which other procedures cannot be used.

In some cases, the stones can be pushed back into the bladder if they are causing urethral obstruction. A technique called urohydropropulsion is often used for this purpose. This technique involves using a special urinary catheter inserted into the urethra to push back the stone into the bladder.

There is also a new technique called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which is minimally invasive. This technique works by producing shockwaves focused on the stone leading to breakage of the stone and subsequent expulsion through urine.

After removal of stone by either technique, your veterinarian will use appropriate radiographic procedures to verify complete removal of stones. Abdominal x-rays or ultrasound are typically utilized at three to five month intervals to enhance early detection of stone formation to prevent repeat surgery.

It is also important that the underlying cause of the stone formation be treated properly to prevent future episodes from occurring.

Living and Management

Typically, your veterinarian will prescribe a new diet plan for your cat. Such plans will help prevent future episodes from occurring. Likewise, it is important that you do not alter your cats diet drastically without prior consultation with your veterinarian."," and Types

32,"Urinary Tract Infection, Lower (Bacterial) in Cats","Bacterial Infection of Bladder and/or Urethra in Cats  

 

Urinary bladder and/or upper portion of urethra may be invaded and colonized by bacteria, which results in an infection more commonly known as a urinary tract infection (UTI). Symptoms related to this type of infection include inflammation of the affected tissue and urinary difficulties.

 

Cats of all ages can be affected, but vulnerability increases with advancing age (common in cats 10 years or older). In such cases, stone formation, prostate disease, and tumors are frequently seen.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Difficulty urinating
	Blood in urine (hematuria)
	Cloudy or malodorous urine
	Frequent urination, but only in small amounts
	Urinary incontinence, especially during confinement or at places that are not customary (i.e., locations he has not peed before)
	Urination when bladder is touched (occasional)


 

Causes

 

E. coli, Staphylococcus, and Proteus spp. account for more than half of all cases of bacterial infections of the lower urinary tract. Less common bacteria include Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Corynebacterium spp.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Although the results of the CBC and biochemistry profile are often normal, urinalysis findings will provide valuable information for initial diagnosis. For instance, pus, blood, or proteins are often seen in the urine. The urine sample, which is taken from the bladder with a syringe, is then cultured to grow the causative bacteria (allowing for sensitivity testing).

 

Once the bacteria is identified, your veterinarian will recommend suitable antibiotics for treatment. X-rays and ultrasonography of the lower urinary tract may also reveal the presence of stone or other abnormal lesion.



  



Treatment

 

Most cats recover without complications once the appropriate antibiotics are administered. However, it is important to identify the issue quickly, as such forms of lower urinary tract infections can travel up to kidneys, heart, and other areas, resulting in more severe complications.

 

Living and Management

 

Prognosis will ultimately depend on the diagnosis; however, most cats require little more than antibiotics to resolve the infection. In cases of severe and complicated infections with obstructions, surgery may be required. Dietary changes may also be implemented to prevent future episodes of stone formation.

 

Antibiotics should always be administered at the prescribed dosage and frequency. In addition, do not stop or alter treatment without prior consulting your veterinarian. If long-term antibiotic treatment is recommended, watch your cat for adverse effects, such as allergies, and immediately call your veterinarian if they should arise.

 

Urine cultures are done 7 to 10 days after completion of therapy. If infection is still present, more prolonged antibiotic therapy or changing the antibiotic may be required."," related to this type of infection include inflammation of the affected tissue and urinary difficulties.

 

Cats of all ages can be affected, but vulnerability increases with advancing age (common in cats 10 years or older). In such cases, stone formation, prostate disease, and tumors are frequently seen.

33,Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats,"What Is a Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats?
The medical term for urinary tract blockage is urethral obstruction, since the urethra is the portion of the urinary tract where the blockage has occurred. You may also hear it referred to as a “blocked cat.” Regardless of the term used, a urinary tract blockage means your pet can’t empty their bladder.

In a normal cat anatomy, urine is produced in the two kidneys and travels down their respective tubes (ureters) to the bladder. When a pet is ready to urinate, the urine travels from the bladder down a single tube (urethra), through the penis in males and vulva in females, to the outside. Urinary blockage occurs most commonly in male cats because the male urethra is skinnier than the female one and more prone to blockage.

This blockage can result in life-threatening consequences such as dangerous electrolyte abnormalities, which can affect the heart and cause kidney failure and bladder rupture (tear). Urinary tract blockage in cats is a medical emergency, and any cat suspected to be blocked should be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately.

Symptoms of Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats 
Urinary tract blockages can have symptoms similar to other urinary conditions. Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a blanket term to describe urinary tract conditions in cats involving the urethra and bladder, including urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and inflammation (swelling). One common cause of FLUTD is feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). FIC is an inflammatory condition of the bladder that occurs secondary to stress.

FLUTD, FIC, and urethral obstruction can all result in similar clinical signs and make it difficult for the pet parent to determine which condition is affecting their cat. This determination is extremely important, because although FLUTD and FIC are typically not urgent, urethral obstruction can be fatal.

Common clinical signs noted with FLUTD, FIC, and the onset of urethral obstruction include:


	
	Bloody urine
	
	
	Urgency to urinate (more frequent trips to the litter box)
	
	
	Urinating smaller amounts more often
	
	
	Straining to urinate (which can sometimes be confused with straining to defecate)
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box (often in strange places such as a bathtub, sink, or tile floor)
	
	
	Licking the genital area
	
	
	Vocalization (meowing loudly and often) as if in pain or distress
	
	
	Lethargy/increased hiding
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting/diarrhea
	


The defining sign of your cat having a urethral obstruction is straining to urinate with no urine production or only a few drops of urine produced. It can be hard to tell, especially if your pet has been going to the litter box frequently or urinating outside the litter box in the house. Placing your cat in a small bathroom with a litter box for a few hours to check for any urine production may be the best way to determine if they are urinating.

If you are unsure your cat is producing urine, consider this an emergency, and have them evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Life-threatening consequences can occur in as little as 12-24 hours of being unable to urinate. Death from untreated obstruction may occur in as little as 36-48 hours.

Causes of Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats 
Common causes of urethral obstruction include:


	
	Urethral plugs: These are the most common cause of obstruction in male cats. Urethral plugs are a combination of crystals and mucous formed by the body; they lodge in the urethra and prevents urine from exiting.
	
	
	Bladder stones: These can move from the bladder and lodge in the urethra, causing urethral obstruction.
	
	
	Stricture (narrowing of the urethra) and cancer: These are rare but possible causes.
	
	
	Swelling: In up to 50% of cases, no definitive cause was found, but inflammation likely plays a role.
	


Any breed of cat is at risk for urethral obstruction, but males are more susceptible than females because they have a much narrower urethra. Cats that do not drink enough water may also be at higher risk.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats 
Your veterinarian will start with a complete medical history of your cat. Be sure to immediately share any information regarding straining, trouble urinating, or bloody urine.

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination of your cat, including palpating (touching) the abdomen to locate the bladder. In a normal cat, the bladder should be small and soft like a water balloon. In a cat with FLUTD or FIC, the bladder is often extremely small and unable to be palpated since the cat has been urinating so frequently. In a blocked cat, the bladder will be firm and hard like a baseball and will likely be painful on palpation.

The veterinarian may also attempt to gently squeeze the bladder with a small amount of pressure, but in most urethral obstructions, the bladder cannot be emptied this way. Palpation of the bladder is a key part of diagnosing a urinary tract blockage, but it should be performed by a veterinarian only.

If a cat is extremely obese or irritable, even a veterinarian may have trouble palpating the bladder and additional testing may be recommended. Abdominal ultrasound can be useful in evaluating bladder size and to check for bladder masses or suspected urinary crystals. An abdominal x-ray may be performed to see bladder size and check for bladder or urethral stones.

A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will all likely be recommended for further evaluation.

Treatment of Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats 
Blocked cats must be unblocked. Treatment involves relieving the obstruction and treating a potentially fatal buildup of electrolytes and urinary toxins. This is achieved by placing a urinary catheter while your cat is under sedation or anesthesia. Placing a urinary catheter in a blocked cat can be challenging, and possible complications include tearing the urethra and bladder rupture, which may result in the need for emergency surgery.

Thankfully, most cats are successfully unblocked, and a urinary catheter is sewn in place for the next 3-5 days. During this time, cats with significantly elevated potassium are often treated with calcium gluconate and/or insulin and glucose to decrease potassium levels and protect the heart. The cat will be hospitalized on pain medication and IV fluids. Antibiotics and a prescription diet may also be prescribed. Once the obstruction is removed and pressure is relieved off the kidneys, kidney values usually return to normal. However, acute kidney failure is possible.

In most cases, medical management is considered the standard of care. However, if the cat has bladder stones or a previous history of urethral obstruction, your veterinarian may recommend surgery. Cystotomy is performed to remove bladder stones. Perineal urethrostomy (PU) is a specialized reconstructive surgical procedure to create a wider urethral opening in a male cat, similar to a female, and prevent future urethral blockages. PU comes with risks and will not prevent future episodes or clinical signs of FLUTD or FIC. Your veterinarian can help advise you if PU is the correct treatment for your cat.

Recovery and Management of Urinary Tract Blockage in Cats
Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for successful outcomes in urinary tract blockages in cats. Most cats will need to remain hospitalized for 3-5 days for IV fluids, pain medications, and other supportive care. Once the urine becomes clear and recheck bloodwork has normalized, the urinary catheter can be removed, and your pet should be monitored for an additional 12-24 hours to ensure they do not get another blockage. They can typically be discharged once they are urinating on their own.

Once discharged from the hospital, your cat may be prescribed medications to help the urethra relax for up to 2 weeks, and they may be prescribed oral pain medications and antibiotics as needed. A prescription diet will likely be recommended for the rest of their life to prevent and dissolve future crystal formation and promote bladder health by altering the pH of the urine. Increasing water consumption with waterfall waterers and a canned diet may also be recommended.

Commonly recommended products for a prescription diet include:


	
	Hill's c/d
	
	
	Royal Canin SO
	


With timely and appropriate care, most blocked cats go on to live normal lives with small dietary changes, but pet parents should remain vigilant of their cat’s urination. More obstructions are possible, and if your pet has more than two episodes of urethral obstruction, it may be time to discuss PU surgery with your veterinarian.

Urinary tract blockages can have symptoms similar to other urinary conditions. Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a blanket term to describe urinary tract conditions in cats involving the urethra and bladder, including urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and inflammation (swelling). One common cause of FLUTD is feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). FIC is an inflammatory condition of the bladder that occurs secondary to stress.

FLUTD, FIC, and urethral obstruction can all result in similar clinical signs and make it difficult for the pet parent to determine which condition is affecting their cat. This determination is extremely important, because although FLUTD and FIC are typically not urgent, urethral obstruction can be fatal.

Common clinical signs noted with FLUTD, FIC, and the onset of urethral obstruction include:


	
	Bloody urine
	
	
	Urgency to urinate (more frequent trips to the litter box)
	
	
	Urinating smaller amounts more often
	
	
	Straining to urinate (which can sometimes be confused with straining to defecate)
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box (often in strange places such as a bathtub, sink, or tile floor)
	
	
	Licking the genital area
	
	
	Vocalization (meowing loudly and often) as if in pain or distress
	
	
	Lethargy/increased hiding
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting/diarrhea
	


The defining sign of your cat having a urethral obstruction is straining to urinate with no urine production or only a few drops of urine produced. It can be hard to tell, especially if your pet has been going to the litter box frequently or urinating outside the litter box in the house. Placing your cat in a small bathroom with a litter box for a few hours to check for any urine production may be the best way to determine if they are urinating.

If you are unsure your cat is producing urine, consider this an emergency, and have them evaluated by a veterinarian immediately. Life-threatening consequences can occur in as little as 12-24 hours of being unable to urinate. Death from untreated obstruction may occur in as little as 36-48 hours.

34,Urinary Incontinence in Cats,"What Is Urinary Incontinence in Cats?
Urinary incontinence is the involuntary (accidental) leakage of urine. In cats, it can be a congenital (birth defect) or acquired (occurring later in life) problem with either storing urine or urinating. In normal function, the bladder wall will relax to allow urine to collect until a certain point. Once full, the bladder wall will contract to empty the bladder, while the urethral sphincter muscle relaxes to allow the urine to flow easily. When something goes wrong with this process, urine leaks or pools out—this is urinary incontinence.

Symptoms of Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Urinary incontinence in cats can easily be confused with inappropriate urination (urination that occurs anywhere other than outdoors or in the litter box). Inappropriate urination is more common, but it is a voluntary (purposeful) action. Urinary incontinence will happen involuntarily, without the cat’s knowledge.


	
	Symptoms of involuntary leakage of urine (urinary incontinence) include:

	
		
		Not squatting or in position to urinate
		
	
	



	
	
		
		Cat unaware of urination
		
		
		Urine found in bed during sleep or rest
		
		
		Urine staining or smell near the urethral opening (under the tail). This can be seen as a skin infection.
		
	
	
	
	These symptoms can be seen in both urinary incontinence and inappropriate urination:

	
		
		Chronic urinary tract infection
		
		
		Hematuria (blood in urine)
		
		
		Excessive grooming in urethral area
		
	
	
	
	Symptoms of inappropriate urination that are not seen with urinary incontinence include:

	
		
		Posturing to urinate
		
		
		Straining to urinate
		
		
		Pain during urination
		
		
		Reoccurring urination in certain areas of the house
		
		
		Urination on vertical surfaces (behavioral)
		
	
	


Causes of Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Congenital

Congenital causes are seen when the anatomy of the bladder or urethra did not correctly develop when the cat was in the womb. These causes are present from birth:


	
	Ectopic ureter is when the ureter (the tube between the kidney and bladder) is attached in the wrong location. It is usually seen attached to the urethra, the tube through which urine is eliminated from the bladder to outside the body. This causes the urine to leak directly out instead of pooling in the bladder.
	
	
	The urethral sphincter (the muscle that controls the flow of urine from the bladder) may not form correctly, which allows the urine to flow out once any pressure is applied to the sphincter. It is usually associated with other congenital abnormalities (born with one kidney, small vagina, renal aplasia).
	



	
	Spinal/vertebral abnormalities can cause damage to the nerves in either the bladder wall or sphincter.
	


Acquired

Acquired urinary incontinence is when the inability to urinate begins after birth and is not associated with a birth defect. It is most commonly due to trauma.


	
	Injury to the spine or vertebrae can affect the nerves in the bladder or sphincter.

	
		
		Decrease in nerves to the bladder wall allows the bladder to overfill or not empty completely.
		
		
		Decrease in nerves to the urethral sphincter causes the sphincter to not close properly.
		
	
	
	
	Urethral blockage is the most common cause seen in cats. This occurs when an object obstructs the flow of urine in the urethra, causing overflow of the bladder so that urine leaks out around the obstruction.
	



	
	Feline leukemia virus has been suspected to cause acquired urinary incontinence, resulting in occasional dribbling during times of relaxation.
	


Mimics of Urinary Incontinence

Several metabolic diseases can be mistaken for urinary incontinence. They do this by increasing the amount of urine that is produced, thereby increasing urinary accidents. Some examples are: diabetes, liver disease, hyperthyroid, and renal disease.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Your veterinarian will perform an exam and diagnostic tests to check your cat’s urinary system. A physical exam with a correct history is the most important step. Clinical history is needed to figure out if the issue is truly urinary incontinence or inappropriate urination.

Your veterinarian will need to palpate (feel) the bladder’s size and thickness. The bladder will be large if the bladder wall is allowing the bladder to overfill or if the urethra is blocked. The bladder will be empty and soft if the urine is bypassing the bladder or excessive urination is occurring. A thickened bladder wall is more often seen with irritation or infection of the bladder. On palpation, the veterinarian may be able to feel a bladder stone.

After the physical exam, further tests may be needed:


	
	Urinalysis, to check the status of the urine itself: This allows the veterinarian to know if an infection or crystals are present in the urine.
	
	
	Analysis of the blood chemistry and blood cells will help find the underlying cause. Blood cell counts may be altered with an infection.
	
	
	Radiographs, ultrasound, or endoscope can be used to look at the anatomy of the bladder and urethra. These tests can also check for stones and masses of the lower urinary tract.
	


Treatment of Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Treatment of urinary incontinence in cats is based on the underlying cause. Medications, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment may be tried until the best combination is found. Treatment may be needed for a couple of weeks to months or as lifelong therapy.

Medications


	
	Antibiotics are needed to remove any infection that was found. Infection of the urinary system can cause false results of the testing and compound the clinical symptoms.
	



	
	Several medications can allow the bladder to empty easily. They are needed when the urethra is swollen, overly stimulated, or a blockage is possible. Medications can accomplish this by:

	
		
		Decreasing urethral spasms. Prazosin is a commonly prescribed medication in cats.
		
		
		Increasing relaxation of the urethra
		
		
		Decreasing bladder wall spasms
		
		
		Decreasing stress, allowing the cat to relax more
		
		
		Stimulating the bladder wall to contract
		
	
	
	
	IV fluids are needed to correct renal imbalances and remove toxins from the body after urethral blockage. Toxins, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney malfunction can lead to death if not corrected completely. IV fluids are usually only temporary.
	


Surgical Repair

Depending on the cause of the urinary incontinence, surgery could be an option. A bladder stone must be removed if it is causing bladder or urethral irritation. A urethral catheter can be placed temporarily to remove urethral blockage and allow urination until the swelling has resolved. Periurethral surgery (commonly referred to as a PU surgery) is used when male cats have several episodes of blockage. A PU surgery widens and shortens the urethra permanently in male cats. This surgery cannot be performed in female cats. If a back injury is the underlying cause, surgery can be used to correct the pressure on the spine. Some congenital causes (depending on their severity) can be corrected with surgery as well. 

Your veterinarian will evaluate the cause of the urinary incontinence to help decide if surgery is an option.

Recovery and Management of Urinary Incontinence in Cats
Recovery time depends on the underlying cause. It can range from days to months for the body to reset to normal. Following your veterinarian’s orders closely and watching your cat’s symptoms will help decrease the recovery time. Keeping a close eye on your cat is very important to allow the quickest recovery.

Sometimes urinary incontinence cannot be fully resolved and only managed. Diet change may be needed to prevent urinary crystals or stones. This is commonly used if there has been an earlier urethral blockage. Royal Canin® S/O, Hill’s Science Diet C/D, and Purina® Pro Plan®, Veterinary Prescription Diet UR are commonly prescribed as recommended vet diets. Increase in water intake can help dilute urine if crystals are present, which makes a urethral blockage less likely. An easy way to increase water intake is to feed canned food.

Acupuncture and hyperbaric chambers may help with healing and repair of tissues. The litter pan must be easily accessible to your cat. A litter pan with lower walls may be needed to allow your cat to enter and leave without straining their back or rear limbs. Pheromones (Feliway®), vitamin supplements (Solliquin®), and prescription medications have been used to decrease stress that can be the underlying cause of lower urinary tract disease in cats.

Discuss your cat’s prognosis, recovery, expectations, and long-term care with your veterinarian to understand your cat’s situation better. You may need only to change one thing or several things depending on the cause of urinary incontinence.

Prevention

Not every cause of urinary incontinence can be prevented, but some predisposing conditions can be avoided.

Weight Management

Weight management is key to preventing many diseases, including feline lower urinary tract disease and diabetes. Be aware of your cat’s body condition score; you should feel their ribs easily without seeing them and they should have an abdominal tuck (a slant up after the ribs when seen from the side). Work with your veterinarian if your cat needs to be on a weight management plan.

Food Quality and Type

Lower-quality food has been linked to urinary tract diseases. The concentration of certain electrolytes affects the pH of the urine, allowing crystals and stones to form. Canned food has also been linked to decreasing occurrence of feline urinary tract disease. Feeding good-quality food with the inclusion of wet food is ideal. Royal Canin®, Hill’s Science Diet, and Purina® Pro Plan® are commonly recommended by veterinarians. Discuss the best food options with your veterinarian.

Urinary incontinence is typically uncommon in cats. But feline lower urinary tract disease is very common—and it is sometimes difficult to see the difference between the two diseases. Medical intervention is needed for both diseases. It’s important to stay up to date on your cat’s annual exam to catch underlying diseases that must be treated immediately.

35,Urinary Bladder Cancer (Rhabdomyosarcoma) in Cats,"Rhabdomyosarcoma of the Urinary Bladder in Cats

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a very rare metastasizing (spreading), and malignant type of tumor. It may derive from stem cells, or originate in the striated muscle that surrounds the developing Müllerian or Wolffian ducts. Müllerian ducts begin as two ducts in the female embryo, developing into the vagina, uterus and oviducts, while Wolffian ducts begin in the male embryo, developing into the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles through the penis (vas deferens).

Rhabdomyosarcoma of the urinary bladder may be reported as botryoid rhabdomyosarcomas due to their tendency to take on the appearance of grape clusters. They often spread to the internal organs and lymph nodes.

Symptoms and Types


    Predominantly 	consistent with a lower urinary tract infection
    Blood 	in the urine
    Straining 	to urinate
    Frequent 	urination in small quantities
    Urine 	retention/inability to urinate


Causes

Idiopathic (unknown)

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. If rhabdomyosarcoma is, in fact, present, the urinalysis will show bloody urine, and a cytologic (microscopic) examination of urine sediment will indicate rhabdomyosarcoma.



The bladder may be internally examined using ultrasound, or double-contrast cystourethrography imaging (which uses an injection of dye into the bladder and urethra to show the structures more distinctly). An intravenous pyelography can also be used for examining the kidney and bladder, to evaluate any trigonal mass, and to assess the ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder), and the renal pelvis (the center of the kidney where the urine funnels into the ureters). This method also uses the injection of a dye to visually examine the internal structure of these organs.

A definitive diagnosis can be made from an examination of the diseased tissue (histopathology) using tissue samples (biopsies) obtained from exploratory surgery, or from cystoscopy – an examination of the bladder and ureters, performed by inserting a tube through the urethra.

Treatment

Surgical removal of the rhabdomyosarcoma is recommended, but it is difficult to perform, since these tumors are highly invasive. If the bladder is also inflamed due to a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be prescribed based on culture and sensitivity tests.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to follow your cat's progress every three weeks during chemotherapy therapy, and every three months after the of course of chemotherapy has ended."," and Types

36,Urethral Shaft Abnormality in Cats,"Ectopic Ureter in Cats

An  ectopic (displaced) ureter is a congenital abnormality in which one or both ureters open into the urethra or vagina. Bilateral ectopia affects both ureters,  and unilateral ectopia affects one ureter.  In cats affected with ectopic ureter, the ureter completely bypasses the bladder and enters the urethra from outside of the bladder walls (extramural type).

Symptoms

This condition is rare, and when it does occur it may be asymptomatic, with no apparent urination problems. When symptoms are apparent, they often present as occasional or continuous incontinence, and inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis) from urine scalding the vaginal tissue.

 
Causes

Ectopic ureter has an unknown mode of inheritance, but there does appear to be a component of breed predisposition.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will use a diagnostic technique called urethrocystoscopy, which uses an insertable tube with an attached camera. In this way, your doctor will be able to examine the bladder internally, and visualization of the urethral opening into the urethra or vagina will be more apparent. Your veterinarian will also be looking to identify holes (perforations) in the structure of the urethra (urethral fenestrations), depressions, striping (or streaking), and tenting in the bladder. When this diagnostic method is performed skillfully, a more accurate diagnosis can be made than with external imaging techniques, such as radiography. Another technique, urethral pressure profilometry, measures surface variations to detect coexistent urethral muscle (sphincter) incompetence. There remains the possibility that a displaced ureter will confound the results of this test, however.



Treatment and Care

Treatment for repairing an ectopic ureter will involve surgically creating a new ureteral opening into the bladder, or removing a blocked or severely infected kidney. A portion of the displaced ureter will need to be removed, if feasible, and the ureter opening (ureterocele) into the bladder then repaired. Incontinence may continue if your cat also has urethral muscle incompetence, and will be weakened to some degree during recovery from surgery. Keeping the litter box close and easily accessible will help your cat to regain its composure over time.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will need to evaluate the effectiveness of the surgery in a follow-up visit. Internal imaging of the urinary organs and bladder using dye injection through the  vaginal canal (for female animals) will follow the track of the fluid and will make it possible to visually inspect the healing of the surgical site. Surgically elevating the vagina to support the bladder neck (where the urethra and bladder join) using the colposuspension technique may correct the incontinence.

If incontinence persists, phenylpropanolamine, an alpha-blocker, may be prescribed to enhance urinary flow, or to relieve tension and pain, a tricyclic antidepressor agent such as imipramine can be prescribed. Reproductive chemical hormone therapy may increase the naturally occurring sensitivity of urethral stress response receptors. Reproductive hormone therapy is not advised in immature animals.","

This condition is rare, and when it does occur it may be asymptomatic, with no apparent urination problems. When symptoms are apparent, they often present as occasional or continuous incontinence, and inflammation of the vagina (vaginitis) from urine scalding the vaginal tissue.

37,Ureter Stones in Cats,"Ureterolithiasis in Cats

Ureterolithiasis is a condition which involves formation of stones that may lodge into the ureter, causing its blockage. A muscular tube which connects the kidney to the bladder, the ureter also carries urine from kidneys to the bladder. Typically, ureter stones originate in the kidneys and later pass down into the ureter.

Depending on the size and shape of the stone, the stone may pass down to the bladder without any resistance or it may partially or completely obstruct the ureter, resulting in the dilatation of the upper portion of the ureter and subsequent kidney damage.

There are a number of different types of stones found in animals and type of stone may vary in according to breeds, age, and sex of the cat.

Symptoms and Types

Some cats with ureterolithiasis display no symptoms, especially during the initial stages. Otherwise, be attentive to the following symptoms:


    Pain
    Kidney failure
    Enlargement or shrinkage of the kidney
    Accumulation of waste products like urea
    Rupture of ureter, resulting in urine accumulation in the abdomen


Causes

The underlying cause may vary depending on the type of the stone. Typical causes include:


    Genetic factors
    Urinary tract infections
    Adverse drug reaction
    Cancer
    Diet and/or supplements
    Surgery that has lead to the narrowing or scarring of the ureter
    Cancer


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your cat. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your cat and severity of the disease. These tests also help in evaluating your pet for any other concurrent disease or condition.

Abdominal X-rays are extremely useful in visualizing the stones and their size; it will also confirm if the kidney has become enlarged as a result of the stones. Similarly, X-rays will depict if the ureter is intact or ruptured. In some cases, a special dye is injected intravenously and X-rays are taken afterward. This helps better visualize the stones by providing contrast. Ultrasound scans is another method for detecting ureter stones and kidney size.

Treatment

Removing the obstructing stones is the primary objective of treatment. Fortunately, advances in modern technology has enabled veterinarians to remove the stones without surgery. A new technique called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy  removes stones located in kidney, ureter, or bladder by producing shockwaves that break apart the stones, which can then be passed through the urine. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy technique does not work for all animals, so consult with your veterinarian if it is right for your cat.

For cats in which surgery is necessary, intravenous fluids are administered to maintain them hydrated. Antibiotics are also prescribed for cats with concurrent urinary tract infection.

Living and Management

As relapses are common, continuous monitoring of the cat's condition is necessary. Typically, followup evaluations are done every 3-6 months. Depending on the type of stone, your veterinarian will suggest dietary changes to prevent future episodes of stone formation. If your cat is not tolerating the dietary changes well, contact him or her for necessary changes.

The overall prognosis is highly variable depending on the type of the stones."," and Types

What Is Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats?
An upper respiratory infection (URI) is an infection in the nose, sinuses, mouth, and/or throat. There are several infectious agents, both viruses and bacteria, that play a role in respiratory infections in cats.

During a URI, cats have inflammation and drainage in the mucous membranes of their nose and throat. They often have drainage from their eyes and nose and may experience significant sneezing. This occurs because the body’s defenses are trying to flush the infectious organisms from the body to eliminate infection.

Most URIs are contagious from cat to cat. The excessive secretions and sneezing help to spread the bacteria or viruses from one cat to another.

The most common “bugs” resulting in upper respiratory infections in cats are feline herpes virus (also known as feline rhinotracheitis) and feline calicivirus. There are many other organisms that may play a role in causing respiratory infections, including feline bordetella, chlamydophila, mycoplasma, and cryptococcus. 

Most upper respiratory infections are not considered a medical emergency. Severe URIs however, can lead to depression and a refusal to eat, which can be fatal in young kittens or senior cats who grow weak quickly without regular nutrition and adequate hydration.

Symptoms of Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats

	Sneezing
	
	Drainage from the eyes
	
	
	Conjunctivitis (swelling or redness of the membranes around the eyes)
	
	
	Squinting
	
	
	Nasal drainage or crust
	
	
	Nasal congestion
	
	
	Decreased or absent appetite
	
	
	Cough
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Ulcers in the mouth
	
	
	Lymph node swelling
	
	
	Difficulty breathing

Causes of Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats
Most of the infectious agents that cause URIs are contagious and can be spread in several ways. Feline herpes virus notoriously leads to sneezing, which in turn leads to aerosol transmission. This occurs when one cat sneezes near another cat, who inhales the germs. Direct transmission can also occur from mutual grooming and cats rubbing against one another.

Many respiratory diseases are spread by fomites. A fomite is an object that was contaminated by one cat’s germs and then touched by another cat. Environmental exposure can come from food and water dishes, cages, bedding, and even humans—all of which can serve as fomites to spread URIs from cat to cat.

However, most of the viruses commonly implicated in feline URIs do not survive on surfaces for very long. For this reason, most infections are the result of direct exposure to an infected cat.

Immune status can also play a role in cats developing upper respiratory infections. When the immune system is weakened (by stress or concurrent disease), a cat is susceptible to contracting a URI. Therefore, it’s common for a shelter cat to show clinical signs of a URI 7-10 days after moving to a new home. Stress from the change in routine leads to decreased immune function and allows the virus or bacteria to grow stronger.

Additionally, some cats can serve as carriers of upper respiratory disease. They show no visible clinical signs but are still shedding viral particles and are infectious to other cats.

Risk Factors for Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats

There are several risk factors that increase a cat’s chances of contracting an upper respiratory infection. Kittens and senior cats with less robust immune systems, are more prone to catching URIs. Similarly, cats with underlying diseases taxing their immune system are also more susceptible. Cats that have a diagnosis of feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are significantly more prone to URIs.

Certain breeds of cat with shortened noses or “smushed” faces are at a higher risk of complications. Those breeds, called brachycephalics, have shortened bones in the skull, giving the face a flat, pushed-in appearance. Brachycephalic cats include breeds like Persians, Himalayans, and Burmese. All may have more difficulty clearing an upper respiratory infection than non-brachycephalic breeds.

Stress plays a huge role in many of the diseases that commonly affect cats. For cats in animal shelters, URI is the most reported illness. Studies have shown that reducing stress (providing more places to hide, lowering noise volume, and increasing enclosure space) can reduce the incidence of respiratory disease.

Stress has a negative effect on the immune system, lowering its ability to fight infections. Feline herpes virus is unique because it can go into a dormant state where the virus is still present, but the cat is not actively shedding the virus at that time. When stress decreases immune function, the feline herpes virus comes out of remission, and the cat starts shedding viral particles, becoming clinical for the disease. The herpes virus is very common in cats. Studies estimate that up to half of healthy cats have been exposed and have the feline herpes virus dormant in their bodies.

Vaccinations can be helpful in reducing your cat’s risk of contracting an upper respiratory infection. Most cats who receive regular veterinary care get the FVRCP vaccine. If cats are up to date on vaccinations, they are much less likely to contract a URI. Additionally, if they do become infected, they are more likely to experience mild clinical signs that do not require treatment.

If your cat goes outdoors, or has increased exposure to other cats, your veterinarian may also recommend your cat be vaccinated for feline leukemia, which is spread from cat to cat through mutual grooming and shared food bowls or items.

Leukemia makes cats more susceptible to URIs as it tends to weaken the immune system. Spending time outdoors naturally increases a cat’s risk for exposure to upper respiratory infections, as cats are less likely to encounter infected cats when they are only inside their own home. Similarly, if your cat is picked up and put in an animal shelter, the likelihood of exposure increases. Boarding facilities may also be a source of exposure to feline URIs.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats
Upper respiratory infections are most often diagnosed based on a physical exam by a veterinarian.

Your veterinarian may recommend radiographs (x-rays) to look at your cat’s lungs and rule out any lower respiratory involvement, like pneumonia. Sometimes blood work is recommended, and/or feline leukemia and FIV testing to rule out underlying concurrent infections.

If the upper respiratory infection is severe or complicated and not responding to classic treatment, your veterinarian may recommend a culture and sensitivity or PCR test to identify the organism and determine the best course of treatment. In this procedure, the vet uses a swab to collect drainage from your cat’s nasal passages and sends it to a laboratory to either swab out the drainage on a petri dish and incubate to see what bacteria grows—or run PCR testing to identify any viral pathogens present.

Sometimes special imaging, like nasal endoscopy or CT, is recommended if a nasal polyp or mass is suspected as a cause of recurring secondary URIs.

Treatment of Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats
Upper respiratory infections are often treated with supportive care if a virus, like feline herpes virus or calicivirus, is suspected. Your veterinarian may recommend probiotics (like Fortiflora and Proviable) or amino acids supplements (like L-Lysine products, such as Viralys and Vetri Lysine Plus) to support your cat’s immune system as it fights the virus.

Some cats can benefit from steam therapy, and your veterinarian may recommend that you keep your cat in the bathroom while showering to keep nasal passages moist.

URIs in cats at times can involve bacteria, and these patients are usually prescribed an antibiotic. If your cat is prescribed an antibiotic, be sure to follow the label instructions exactly. Do not discontinue the medication before the course is complete and avoid missing doses. If the antibiotic prescribed to your cat is causing any gastrointestinal side effects, (like vomiting or diarrhea) let your veterinarian know to determine if an alternate medication would be better tolerated.

Severe URIs may require hospitalization with oxygen therapy and/or nebulization treatments and injectable antibiotics.

Are there home remedies to treat upper respiratory infections in cats?

Upper respiratory infections that are the result of a viral infection are often managed at home with supportive care. However, when bacterial agents are involved, these infections rarely resolve without antibiotic therapy. Talk to your veterinarian about your cat’s clinical signs to determine if prescription medications are required. The signs of a more serious infection, to be addressed immediately include:


	
	Decreased of absent appetite
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Green-yellow drainage from the eyes or nose
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	


If your cat has any of the above clinical signs, reach out to a veterinarian right away to seek treatment. But if your cat is eating normally and has decent energy, you can continue to monitor the situation at home.

Recovery and Management of Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats
The average timeline of recovery for herpes viral outbreaks is typically two weeks. During that time, it is recommended that you monitor your cat closely. Make sure the cat is eating regularly and energy levels are improving, not getting worse. Probiotics may enhance the palatability of food and support gut health, while your cat’s body fights the virus. Water additives, like Purina Hydra Care, may increase water intake to keep your cat hydrated while the immune system is compromised.

Consider keeping your cat in the bathroom so it can benefit from the steam as you shower. Wipe any ocular or nasal drainage with a gentle wipe that is approved for use in cats, like those from Optixcare.

Remember, feline herpes virus is not cured, but rather managed. Cats diagnosed with feline herpes are susceptible to having another viral outbreak in the future. Stress is one of the biggest contributors to viral shedding. Consider managing stress as much as possible. There are many oral supplements on the market designed to help your cat manage stress, including Zylkene, Vetriscience Composure, and Purina Calming Care.

Some pet parents find that pheromone diffusers, like Feliway, are beneficial for managing stress. Environmental enrichment may also provide some stress relief for your cat. Make sure that your cat has easy access to all resources (food, water, litter box, and perch).

Prevention of Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats

Prevention of URIs is mostly done by vaccination and limiting exposure. Consider having a pet sitter, family member, or friend come to your house to care for your cat when you leave town, rather than using a boarding facility. Remember that going outside provides your cat with more opportunity to mingle with neighborhood cats or strays, increasing the risk of contracting a URI.

Vaccinations are very helpful at both preventing infection and reducing the severity of clinical signs in cats with URIs. Follow your veterinarian’s recommended vaccine schedule and keep your cat up to date on all recommended inoculations.

If your cat already has an underlying feline herpes virus infection, minimize stress as much as possible to reduce shedding of the virus.
Upper Respiratory Infection in Cats FAQsAre upper respiratory infections in cats contagious to humans?URIs are very common in cats, especially those that are newly adopted from shelters or rescue organizations. While a URI is contagious when spreading from cat to cat, it is not contagious to humans or other pets, like dogs.
Does upper respiratory infection in cats cause death? URIs most commonly result in nasal drainage and sneezing that may be self-limiting. However, some URIs can progress to more serious infections requiring medical treatment from your cat’s veterinarian.

39,Upper Respiratory Infection (Chlamydia) in Cats,"Chlamydiosis in Cats



Chlamydiosis refers to a bacteria based chronic respiratory infection, caused by the Chlamydia psittaci bacterium. Cats that have developed this infection will often exhibit traditional signs of an upper respiratory infection, such as watery eyes, runny nose, and sneezing. With treatment, the prognosis is positive.



Symptoms and Types



Chlamydiosis infection affects the respiratory system, the eyes, the gastrointestinal system and the reproduction systems of animals. Cats experience standard upper respiratory tract symptoms, including: 


	Sneezing
	Watery eyes
	Discharge from eyes
	Coughing
	Difficulty breathing
	Runny nose
	Lack of appetite (anorexia)
	Fever
	Pneumonia, if left untreated




Causes



While there is a higher prevalence of this infection in kittens, this condition is present in all ages and breeds. Cats that are kept in crowded quarters with other animals, as in a kennel, are at an increased risk of infection. Added to the risk is the ease with which this bacteria travels. Transmission can take place even without direct contact with an infected animal, as the molecules from a cough or sneeze can travel across a room, a human caretaker can carry the bacteria and spread it by touch, or the cat may come into contact with a contaminated object, such as in a bedding or feeding area.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarians will take a sample of the eye discharge, also referred to as a conjunctival scraping or swabbing, in order to have a culture of the fluid done to determine what the source of the illness is. If it is believed that pneumonia is present, an X-ray of your cat's lungs will be performed to check for the presence of fluid.









Treatment



Treatment is most often performed on an outpatient basis, starting with antibiotics for cats such as tetracycline or doxycycline. Antibiotic treatments may be given orally or as an external direct application onto the eye. The entire treatment process may take up to six weeks.



Living and Management



The cat should be kept away from other animals until the infection heals, since it is communicable; it is also advisable to keep the cat indoors. If there are multiple animals in the household, they should all be treated to prevent another outbreak of the disease.



Prevention



There is no preventative measure that can be taken for this medical issue, but vaccinations can help to reduce the severity of outbreaks when they do occur."," and Types

40,Upper and Lower Jaw Fracture in Cats,"Maxillary and Mandibular Fractures in Cats

 

The mandible, also called the jawbone, forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place, whereas the maxilla forms the upper jaw and holds the upper teeth in place.

 

Upper jaw (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible) fractures are seen in cats mostly due to trauma and injuries.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Symptoms vary greatly depending upon the type, location, extent, and cause of injury. Some of the more common ones include:

 


	Facial deformity
	Oral or nasal bleeding
	Inability to open or close the jaw
	Fractured teeth
	Facial distortion


 

Causes

 

Although various types of injuries and trauma are typically responsible for fractures of the upper and lower jaw, certain risk factors may predispose a cat to the fractures, including oral infections (e.g., periodontal disease, osteomyelitis), certain metabolic diseases (e.g., hypoparathyroidism), and congenital or hereditary factors resulting in a weakened or deformed jaw.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health. The important thing your cat’s veterinarian would like to know is about the injury or the trauma history. After recording your cat’s history, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. He or she will closely examine the oral cavity, jaw bones, teeth, and other related structures. He or she will also take X-rays of the oral cavity to look into the location and extent of the fracture.



 

Treatment

 

Surgery is most often used to repair the fracture. However, there are several methods to accomplish the surgical repair. Your cat’s veterinarian will give his or her expert opinion based on the type of fracture, available equipment, supplies, and the pros and cons of performing each option. The ultimate goal of surgical intervention is to reduce the fracture, establish the natural occlusion of bones and teeth, and stabilize the fracture to enhance the healing process. Pain killers and antibiotics are also prescribed to control pain and infections, respectively.

 

Living and Management

 

Overall prognosis depends on type, extent, location of trauma, quality of home care, and selection of treatment modality. Healing typically takes 4 to 12 weeks, and thus, requires good owner compliance during the treatment period to aid in healing.

 

Wax is often prescribed to be applied over irritating wires used during surgery. And oral irrigants are used for oral hygiene and to reduce the number of bacteria in the oral cavity. After surgery, your cat will feel very sore and will need painkillers for a few days. Good pain management will help in the healing process; this involves administering pain killers at the prescribed dosage and time.

 

A postoperative evaluation, including X-rays, will be done after to weeks to see if the fracture has been stabilized and is healing well. There is always a chance of refracture after the support has been removed, so extra care will be needed to prevent such a recurrence. Provide good cage rest and minimize any risk of trauma. Don’t allow other pets to come in contact with your cat and keep it in noise-free environment.

 

Also, due to the involvement of the oral cavity, ingestion and chewing of food is highly painful and difficult. You will need to maintain the recommended nutritional and fluid diet during the healing process, paying extra attention to your cat’s weight. Soft food is recommended for easy chewing and ingestion."," and Types

41,Umbilical Hernia in Cats,"Umbilical Cat Hernia




An umbilical hernia is an opening in the muscle wall where the umbilicus (belly button) is located. The hernia allows the abdominal contents to pass through the opening.



Symptoms and Types



Umbilical hernias may be complicated or uncomplicated. A complicated hernia is one in which contents of the abdominal cavity, such as a loop of intestine, have passed through the opening and become entrapped.



An uncomplicated umbilical hernia is associated with a soft swelling in the umbilical area. This swelling may be variable in size and may come and go. Otherwise, the cat will appear healthy.



Symptoms seen with a complicated umbilical hernia may include:




	Pain and warmth, especially at the site of the umbilical swelling
	Vomiting
	Lack of appetite
	Depression




Causes



Most umbilical hernias in cats are probably inherited although trauma can also be a cause.



Diagnosis



Umbilical hernias can usually be diagnosed by finding the swelling caused by the hernia on a physical examination. However, sometimes contrast radiographs (x-rays) or an abdominal ultrasound are needed to determine which abdominal contents, if any, are entrapped.







Treatment



Treatment of an umbilical hernia involves surgical correction of the opening and replacement of abdominal contents if necessary. Some umbilical hernias will, however, close spontaneously, usually by 6 months of age.



Small umbilical hernias may not need surgical correction but larger hernias should be repaired to remove the risk of complications.



Prevention



Because many umbilical hernias are hereditary, pets with these hernias should not be bred."," and Types

42,Twisted Spleen in Cats,"Splenic Torsion in Cats  The spleen exists as a main support to the immune system. It acts as a filter to destroy excess red blood cells, and as a reservoir for blood. Splenic torsion, or twisting of the spleen, may occur by itself, or in association with gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) syndrome, when a cat's air-filled stomach expands and twists on itself. It can occur suddenly, or it can gradually twist over a period of time. Being affected by an abnormality such as splenic torsion is rare.  Symptoms and Types       Intermittent 	lack of appetite     Vomiting     Weight 	loss     Red 	to brown colored urine     Abdominal 	pain     Pale 	gums     Increased 	heart rate     Abdominal 	mass that can be felt   Causes       Prior 	gastric dilatation, and volvulus (abnormal expansion, and twisting 	of the intestinal or gastric organs)     Excessive 	exercise, rolling, and retching may contribute     Nervousness 	and anxiety have been associated with an increased risk of GDV    Diagnosis  Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.  You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.  A coagulation test may show prolonged bleeding times, which would indicate a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (clotting within multiple veins throughout the system), a serious end-stage disease of the cardiovascular system.  Abdominal x-ray images may reflect a mass, and/or an abnormally located spleen. An abdominal ultrasound may be used for a more sensitive imaging of the spleen. Your veterinarian may also want to use an electrocardiogram to trace blood flow, a blockage in the flow may show as arrhythmias of the heart.  Treatment  Patients with GDV should be considered a surgical emergency. After fluid therapy and medical treatment, a surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy) will need to be performed. At this time, the stomach should be surgically affixed, or it may flip again at a later date. A splenic sample should be submitted for histopathologic examination (laboratory study of abnormal tissue). Fluid support and cardiovascular monitoring will be provided after splenectomy.  Living and Management  Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your cat's progress. You will need to monitor the surgical site for cleanliness, following your veterinarian's instructions for proper methods of cleaning a post-surgery wound. Post-surgery infection is a serious issue of concern. If you observe any redness, swelling, itching, or oozing at the site, you will need to contact your veterinarian. Because the spleen plays a role in the immune system, there is some concern that the absence of the spleen may place an animal at an increased risk of infection. You may wish to talk with your veterinarian about ways to strengthen your cat's immune system, or to protect it from injury and illness.  If your cat shows symptoms of GDV again, call your veterinarian immediately for advisement.", and Types       Intermittent 	lack of appetite     Vomiting     Weight 	loss     Red 	to brown colored urine     Abdominal 	pain     Pale 	gums     Increased 	heart rate     Abdominal 	mass that can be felt   
43,Tumors of the Vagina in Cats,"Vaginal Tumors in Cats
 
Vaginal tumors in cats are extremely rare and are usually of benign smooth muscle origin. (There are several types of smooth muscle tumors, including leiomyoma;  fibroleiomyoma, a fibrous tissue and smooth muscle tissue tumor; and  fibroma, a fibrous tissue tumor.) A vaginal tumor may never bother the cat (and thus never be diagnosed), or it may cause complications that are not a direct result of the tumor, but a result of its presence in the body, such as with uterine leiomyomatas, which can cause excessive menstrual bleeding. Other complications can include constipation, and difficulty with birthing.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Firm mass
    Constipation
    Discharge from the vagina                

 
Causes
 
Female cats that are unspayed are most commonly affeted with vaginal tumors, especially those that have never given birth.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A vaginoscopy will be performed. This method uses a tiny instrument that is equipped with a camera for inspecting the inside of the vagina, and which is capable of cutting and gathering tissue for biopsy. The biopsy, along with a cytologic examination of an aspirate taken from the vaginal tissue may help to determine the vaginal tumor’s cell type. An examination of vaginal cells and tissue is necessary for a definitive diagnosis to be made. 
 
Chest X-rays should also be taken to check for spread of the cancer. Abdominal X-rays may show the vaginal tumor, while ultrasonography, vaginography, and urethrocystography may help to visualize a mass. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will give a clearly outlined image of a tumor, allowing your doctor to assess for surgical feasibility, and to assess for possible degree of cancerous spread.
 
Treatment
 
Surgical removal of the vaginal tumor with a concurrent spaying of the patient is the treatment of choice. For sarcomas and mast cell tumors (which are malignant), or for benign tumors which can not be completely removed, post-operative radiotherapy is indicated. 
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you to have your cat X-rayed. Depending on the severity and type of the tumor, these follow-ups may be as frequent as every three months if the tumor was malignant (aggressive and spreading). Bloodwork will be done before each chemotherapy treatment to check on your cat's health status and progress."," and Types

44,Tumors of the Gums (Epulis) in Cats,"Epulis in Cats

Tumors or tumor-like masses on an animal's gums are referred to as epulides. They appear early on as masses sprouting from the gum, which seem to hang from a stalk, and often displace tooth structures as they expand. Most epulides stick to the bone, do not have a capsule, and have a smooth to slightly nodular surface. They do not spread but may deform the face.

Epulides are rare in cats, but occur most often in brachycephalic breeds.

Symptoms and Types

There are three categories of epulides: fibromatous, ossifying, and acanthomatous. Acanthomatous epuli, in particular, are highly invasive to the bone and  are usually located on the front part of the lower jaw. On occasion your cat will display no visible outward signs. It is therefore important you look inside your cat's mouth if you suspect a problem. Symptoms associated with epulides include:


    Excessive 	salivation
    Bad 	breath (halitosis)
    Trouble 	eating
    Blood 	from the mouth
    Weight 	loss
    Enlargement 	of the lymph nodes in the neck
    Asymmetric 	upper or lower jaw


Causes

None identified.

Diagnosis

After you give a complete medical history for the animal to the veterinarian, he or she will conduct a thorough oral examination, which should reveal an epulide. If present, X-rays will be taken to classify the type of epulis and check the health of the teeth around the epulis. A section of the epulis must also be cut out, down to the bone, to be sent to the laboratory for analysis. This is best done while your cat is anesthetized.




Treatment

Your veterinarian will remove the epulis surgically while your pet is anesthetized. Any teeth that have been extensively damaged by the epulis will also be removed, and the tooth socket will be cleaned out with special dental instruments.

If the epulis is acanthomatous and is thought of as aggressive (they can be precancerous lesions), he or she may need to remove half of your pet’s lower or upper jaw, and administer radiotherapy to your pet to assure the epulis does not come back. He or she may also inject chemotherapeutic agents into the area of the epulis to prevent it from expanding.

Living and Management

Pets should return to the veterinarian one, two, three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months after treatment for thorough oral, head, and neck examinations. Periodic X-rays of the inside of your cat’s mouth should be taken, especially if the mass was diagnosed as an acanthomatous epulis, which may be a precancerous lesion.

Most epulides are cured if the edges of the surgically removed tumor was not cancerous (a laboratory will examine the tumor after your veterinarian has removed it). However, if your veterinarian had to cut into the bone to remove the tumor, the epulide will probably return."," and Types

45,Tumors of the Endocrine Glands in Cats,"Oncocytoma in Cats

Oncocytoma is an extremely rare and benign tumor in cats. This type of tumor involves atypical cells found in the endocrine glands and epithelium (the tissue lining the cavities of the body). Endocrine glands are responsible for secreting hormones directly into the blood and lymph nodes.

As a benign tumor, an oncocytoma does not metastasize, and also tends to be minimally invasive. Concern arises according the location of the tumor, as its presence may restrict movement, blood passages, or airways. Though this is rare in cats, when it does occur, the tumor is commonly found in the area of the larynx. However, the tumor is also commonly found around the kidney, and can occur wherever there are endocrine glands and epithelium.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor mass. In some patients difficult breathing and change in voice may be seen.

Cause

The cause for this disease is unknown.
 
Diagnosis

You will need to give a detailed medical history to your veterinarian, including background symptoms, time of onset, and the frequency of the symptoms. One of the main indications is a change in your cat's tone of voice. Your veterinarian will perform a detailed examination of your cat's larynx – the area of the voice box. Standard laboratory tests will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually normal unless a concurrent disease is present.

If it is indicated, your veterinarian will also take x-rays of larynx and lungs to see if there is any metastasis, which would indicate a different type of tumor. For a more detailed examination, your cat will be lightly sedated and your veterinarian will examine the larynx internally using a laryngoscope (a tubular diagnostic tool that is inserted into the laryngopharynx). During this procedure, your veterinarian will take a sample of tissue from the mass and send it to a veterinary pathologist for evaluation. The biopsy sample should enable your veterinarian to establish a definitive diagnosis.



Treatment

After a concrete diagnosis has been made, your veterinarian will schedule surgery to remove the tumor mass from the larynx area. During surgery, maximum care and efforts will be directed towards saving the larynx functions.
 
Living and Management

After a surgical resection of the tumor mass has been performed, the overall prognosis for most patients is excellent. After a complete resection, a cure is usually achieved in affected patients, as this tumor very seldom metastasizes. However, if a complete resection can not be achieved, you will need to watch your cat for any symptoms of a recurrence, which will require a second round of more aggressive surgery. Again, even with a partial resection, prognosis is generally excellent due to the benign nature of this tumor. Once surgery has been performed successfully, however, no follow-up will be required and your cat may go on to live a normal life."," and Types

Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor mass. In some patients difficult breathing and change in voice may be seen.

46,Tumor Related to Vaccinations in Cats,"Vaccine-associated Sarcoma in Cats

 

Reports of a sarcoma (a cancerous mass arising from bone, cartilage, fat or muscle) developing at the site of vaccine injection sites in some animals have led to the suspicion of a link between the vaccine and a disposition in some animals to this type of reaction. Most types of injectable vaccine and non-vaccine products have rarely been associated with sarcoma development in cats, but cats may develop a site specific sarcoma following rabies vaccination or feline leukemia virus vaccination.



These tumors are characterized as highly invasive, rapidly growing, and malignant. Metastatic (spreading) rates are reported to be 22.5 to 24 percent. Often, the cancer spreads to the lungs, but it may spread to the regional lymph nodes and to the skin as well.

 

The cause for the sarcoma development is unknown, but it is believed that local inflammation must first occur for the malignant mass to follow. In addition, initial reports focused on vaccine adjuvants (assisting ingredients) containing aluminum as a potential cause of the sarcoma. However, the role of aluminum is unclear because not all adjuvants used in the vaccines that have been associated with sarcoma formation have contained aluminum.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Lesions occur at the site of the vaccination, persisting and/or growing in size. In the advanced stages, the lesions will become fixed and occasionally ulcerated.

 

Causes

 

Vaccination with FeLV or rabies vaccine appears the be the underlying cause of this type of sarcoma. In fact, risk of sarcoma formation following a single injectable vaccination in the neck-shoulder region is 50 percent higher than for cats not receiving a vaccination. Moreover, the risk of developing the tumors may increase with the frequency and number of vaccinations given. In one study, cats given two vaccinations at the same site is 127 percent more likely to develop tumors than those not receiving vaccinations, and those with three or four vaccines at the same site were more than one and a half more likely (175 percent higher).

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. FeLV and FIV testing should also be done, though please note that neither virus plays a role in the development of these tumors.

 

To assess the spread of cancert, X-ray imaging of the chest and abdomen should be done. Computed tomography (CT) images with contrasting agents, meanwhile, is used because the agents enable to veterinarian to examine the area more readily. He or she can then record the location, shape, and size of all masses occurring at the injection sites. 

 

Masses at vaccination sites that persist for longer than three months, are larger than two centimeters in diameter, or increase in size one month after the injection should be biopsied. Advanced lesions should also be biopsied prior to definitive treatment.

 



Treatment

 

An effective treatment protocol is difficult, but radiation therapy before or after definitive surgery will substantially enhance your cat's survival. Prior to surgery, a contrast CT scan should also be done, because it has been found to result in a substantially longer time until recurrence of the sarcoma. Chemotherapy, meanwhile, has not been found to enhance survival with this form of cancer.

Living and Management

 

Do not over-vaccinate your cat. Vaccinate for rabies, panleukopenia, herpes-1, and caliciviruses no more frequently than every three years. In addition, vaccination for FeLV is advised only for cats older than 16 weeks that are not restricted to a closed indoor environment that is free of FeLV. Consult your veterinarian, assess the risks of exposure to diseases, and compare them to the risks of vaccine-associated sarcoma formation.

47,Tumor of the Thymus in Cats,"Thymoma in Cats
 
The thymus is a small glandular organ located in front of the heart. Its special function is to serve as a reservoir for the production and maturation of T lymphocytes, white blood cells that make up an important part of the body's immune system. A thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelium  of the thymus (the layer of tissue covering the thymus). Thymomas are rare tumors in cats and are mainly associated with myasthenia gravis, a severe autoimmune disease which causes certain muscle groups to tire easily.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Coughing
    Increased      breathing rate 
    Trouble breathing      
    Cranial caval syndrome -- a side effect of heartworm infestation, which often leads to swelling of the head, neck, or forelimbs
    Myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease that leads to muscle weakness, enlarged esophagus, and frequent regurgitation

 
Causes
 

    Unknown

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. 
 
Thoracic X-rays are standard for breathing related conditions. The resulting images may show a cranial mediastinal mass (a mass between the lungs), pleural effusion (build-up of fluid in the lungs due to aspiration pneumonia) and megaesophagus.  
 
A blood test for antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (a neurotransmitter causing muscles to contract) should be performed to rule out myasthenia gravis. A tensilon test can also be used to test for myasthenia gravis.  
 
A fine-needle aspirate of the mass will show mature lymphocytes (white blood cells) and epithelial cells (cells forming in the outside layer of the thymus gland).


 


Treatment
 
Patients should be hospitalized in preparation for surgery to remove the thymoma. These types of tumors are highly invasive and sometimes difficult to remove. Twenty to thirty percent of thymomas are found to be malignant, with metastasis (spread) throughout the chest and/or abdomen. 
 
Living and Management
 
If the tumor is completely surgically resectable (and has not spread), full remission is generally assured. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every three months with you to retake thoracic X-rays of your cat in case the tumor should recur."," and Types

48,Tumor of the Nerves in Cats,"Nerve Sheath Tumor in Cats

Nerve sheath tumors are tumors that grow from the myelin sheath that covers the peripheral and spinal nerves. This type of tumor affects the nervous system of the body, as it compromises the functioning ability of the peripheral and/or spinal nerves that form the peripheral nervous system and which reside or extend outside the central nervous system (CNS). These tumors are rarely seen in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Progressive and chronic lameness 	in forelimb (common symptom)
    Muscle wasting
    Decreased muscle tone
    Uncoordinated movements
    Limb weakness


Causes

The exact cause of this condition is still not known.

Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination with laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these routine laboratory tests are usually within normal ranges. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord, will also be tested, but the findings are usually non-specific. For confirmation of the diagnosis your veterinarian may need to take biopsy samples from the nerve sheaths using ultrasound guidance. Radiographic studies, including x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT-scan) will provide further information for a solid diagnosis. MRI is the most specific test for diagnosis of this disease.



Treatment

Your veterinarian may perform a surgical resection of the affected nerves. In some cases amputation of the affected limb will need to be performed in order to minimize the chances of a local recurrence of the tumor. More advanced surgical procedures will be required if it is necessary to perform the resection of nerve roots in the more delicate area of the spinal cord. Medications to reduce inflammation and edema (swelling) at the affected site will be prescribed, both to make treatment easier to perform and to make your cat more comfortable. Radiation following surgery can also be considered to decrease the chance of local recurrence. Whether to use radiation therapy or not will be decided by you and your veterinary oncologist.

Living and Management

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize its discomfort. Keep in mind that pain medications must be used with caution, since one of the most preventable accidents that occur with pets is overdose of medication. Follow all directions carefully.

You will need to limit your cat's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets. You might consider cage rest for your cat, to limit its physical activity. Your veterinarian will tell you when it is safe for your cat to move about again. Most cats recover well from amputation, and learn to compensate for the lost limb.

It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. While your cat is in the process of healing, you may set the litter box up closer to where your cat rests, and make it so that it is easy to get in and out of the box.

Nerve tumors are usually locally invasive and do not metastasize. However, local recurrence is common after surgical resection and will need to be treated again."," and Types

49,Tumor of the Meninges in Cats,"Meningioma in Cats 
 
Meningioma, the most common brain tumor found in cats, is a tumor affecting the meninges, the system of membranes that envelops the central nervous system. All breeds of cats are at risk of meningioma, and it is usually seen in cats older than nine years of age.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The symptoms vary depending upon the location of tumor, but some of the more common symptoms include:
 

    Seizures (more common in dogs)
    Visual deficits
    Abnormal behavior or mental state
    Uncoordinated movements
    Neck or back pain

 
Causes
 
The underlying cause for meningioma is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal. For further analysis, your cat’s veterinarian will also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord.
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography scan are the two most valuable tools for identification of lesions and its localization. Although tissue biopsies are also frequently used to diagnose meningioma.

 


Treatment
 
For definitive treatment, complete surgical excision is required, but this is not always possible. Sometimes tumors are not accessible for surgical removal, and other times incomplete excision occurs due to the invasiveness of the tumor. In these cases, radiation therapy may be recommended. Additionally, fluid therapy, dietary changes, and medications are used to control seizures and stabilize the cat. 

Living and Management
 
Overall prognosis depends on the extent of the excision achieved during surgery. Many cats that undergo successful surgery for complete excision of tumor mass, for example, have a good prognosis. However, some animals do not recover well due to the invasiveness of the tumor to deeper tissues or other complications.
 
You will need to take your cat to the veterinarian in regular intervals for follow-up evaluations of the disease and treatment response. After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. To minimize discomfort, your veterinarian will give you pain medication, which should be used with extreme caution (one of the most preventable accidents with pets is an overdose of medication). You will need to limit your cat's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest away from household activity, children, and other pets. You might consider cage rest for your cat to limit its physical activity."," and Types

50,Tumor of the Eye in Cats,"Uveal Melanoma in Cats

 

The uvea is the part of the eye that is made up of the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil), the ciliary body (which produces the fluid within the eye [aqueous humour] and controls the ciliary muscle contractions that aid in near focus), the choroid (which provides oxygen and nourishment to the retina – the inner surface of the eye), and the pars plana (at the front of the eye, where the iris and sclera [white of the eye] touch). A melanoma is clinically characterized by malignant growth of melanocytes, cells that are dark in appearance due to the inclusion of the melanin pigment. 

 

Uveal melanomas in cats usually arise from the front of the iris’ surface, with extension to the ciliary body and choroid. These tumors tend to be flat and diffuse, not nodular (unlike intraocular melanomas, which are raised masses). Such tumors initially have a benign (non-spreading) clinical and cellular appearance. However, an affected cat may develop metastatic disease (due to the spread of the uveal melanoma) up to several years later. The metastatic rate may be up to 63 percent. These tumors are also called diffuse iris melanomas – that is, melanomas of the iris that are capable of spreading. This is the most common type of eye tumor in cats. 

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Possible iris color change
	Dark spot(s) on surface of eye
	Thick and irregular iris
	Possible secondary glaucoma (high pressure in the eye)
	
		Dilated pupil
		Enlarged (bulging) eyeball
		Leads to blindness
	
	


 

Causes

 


	Unknown


 

Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete ophthalmic exam (including testing pressure within the eye and proper drainage of the eye’s aqueous humor). During the ophthalmic exam, tonometry will be used to measure the pressure in the eyes, and gonioscopy will be used to see if the melanoma has spread to the drainage angle. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy can be used to gage the size and location of the mass. 

 

A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Evidence of metastasis may may be present in the blood profile, or the blood count may show increased white blood cells, which can be indicative of the body's immune system fighting the malignant cell growth. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. 

 

X-rays and an ultrasound may also help to determine the extent of metastatic disease in the eye. If there are melanoma cells in the angle between the iris and the cornea, and if there are melanoma cells in the ciliary venous plexus (where veins from the ciliary body drain blood from the eye), then metastatic (cancerous) cells have probably spread throughout the body. However, this metastasis may not be evident until a few years after the initial growth of cells.  





 

Treatment

 


	Older cat with slow progression of the disease – consider simply performing periodic examinations and serial photography to monitor the progress of the lesion(s) 
	Younger cat with rapidly progressive disease – consider removing the eye (enucleation)
	There is some evidence that small, isolated, freckle-like lesions have been successfully treated with laser (diode) photoablation (laser surgery), although no controlled or long-term follow-up studies have been performed to conclusively confirm this 
	Mild to moderate diffuse iris involvement – most ophthalmologists prefer a conservative approach consisting of periodic examinations and serial photography to monitor the growth progress of the lesion(s); enucleation is an alternative if progression can be documented or the owner is highly concerned about the potential for spread of the cancer
	Extensive iris involvement resulting in changes in pupil shape or mobility, extra-iris extension, invasion into the drainage angle (where the aqueous humor drains) or secondary glaucoma (high pressure in the eye due to cancerous cells blocking the drainage angle) – enucleation of the eyeball is suggested
	Removal of the eyeball must be undertaken with caution and precision; in humans removal of an eyeball afflicted with cancer has been associated with metastasis to the left orbit or to the body 


 

Living and Management

 

One long-term study shows that patients with early iris melanoma have no increased risk of life-threatening cancer spread compared to controls, but patients with advanced lesions had dramatically shortened survival times. Your cat's prognosis will depend on if and how much the melanoma has spread within the eye. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you every three months to monitor your cat's intraocular pressure if you decline to have surgery performed on the eye. X-rays to check for metastasis should be taken every six months after the initial diagnosis was made."," and Types

51,Tularemia in Cats,"What is Tularemia in Cats?
Tularemia is a rare but potentially fatal bacterial infection caused by Francisella tularensis. Nicknamed “rabbit fever,” this disease affects primarily rabbits and other wild rodents but in rare cases can also infect cats and even humans. Dogs appear to be mostly immune but can serve as asymptomatic accidental hosts.  

Geographically, tularemia has been reported all over the world including the United States (all states except Hawaii) with higher prevalence in Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas. It is most common in later spring and summer.

Symptoms of Tularemia in Cats
Clinical signs of tularemia in cats can vary from mild to serious, with some cats showing no signs of infection and others becoming dangerously ill. Some common signs and symptoms include:


	
	High fever (104-106F) 
	
	
	Depression and lethargy
	
	
	Large painful lymph nodes 
	
	
	Abdominal pain due to an enlarged liver or spleen
	
	
	Yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of eyes (jaundice)
	
	
	Anorexia and vomiting 
	
	
	Dehydration and general weakness
	
	
	Oral ulcers and abscess
	
	
	Sepsis
	


Causes of Tularemia in Cats
Ticks are the most common way the bacterium Francisella tularensis is transmitted between rabbits and rodents. However, tularemia can also be transmitted by horseflies, mosquitoes, sucking lice, fleas, or biting flies. Tissues and bodily fluids of infected animals will contain the bacteria and can spread the infection. For cats, this may mean they are infected by killing and eating rodents carrying tularemia.

The environment is another possible source of infection, as bacteria can live in the soil for weeks to months and contaminate vegetation or water. The bacteria can also travel through the air (aerosolized) and enter the body through the lungs, cuts in skin, or mucous membranes. 

Tularemia is considered zoonotic which means people can become infected by animals. This may be in the form of vectors (ticks, mosquitoes) from an infected cat to a human or infected tissues or bodily fluids (handling an infected rabbit or cat). The incubation period in humans is typically 3 to 5 days but can range from 1 to 14 days.

Tularemia is highly infectious, contagious, and can be deadly in humans. If you think you have been exposed to tularemia, please seek medical attention immediately.  

How Veterinarians Diagnose Tularemia in Cats
Your veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination to assess for fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and abdominal pain. Providing a detailed history of travel, tick exposure, and hunting habits can be useful when evaluating for tularemia.

A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. Tularemia is extremely rare in cats, so your vet will be focused on ruling out more common clinical conditions such as liver disease or infection.  

If your vet is highly suspicious of tularemia, he or she may recommend specialized laboratory testing.  One option is to test for an immune response (antibodies) to the bacteria Francisella tularensis. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for the presence of the bacteria or specialized cultures for Francisella tularensis in blood or tissue samples may also be needed to confirm the diagnosis. 

In wild animals (rabbits/rodents), tularemia is most often identified postmortem through necropsy (an autopsy for animals). The bacteria often creates large tumor-like masses and abscesses in the animal’s liver which can be a clue to test further for Francisella tularensis.

Treatment of Tularemia in Cats
Early, aggressive treatment is essential to successfully manage tularemia. Cats will likely need to be hospitalized for IV fluids to correct dehydration, and any electrolyte abnormalities, as well as initiating supportive care such as anti-nausea or pain medications. Antibiotics is the treatment option to kill bacteria that causes tularemia. 

Recovery and Management of Tularemia in Cats
Tularemia can be deadly in cats, so early diagnosis and treatment are important to achieve quality outcomes. Most cats remain hospitalized for 2 to 3 days on IV fluids, supportive care, and antibiotics. They can typically be discharged once the fever breaks and they can consistently eat and drink on their own.

Antibiotics will likely be continued for a total of 3 to 4 weeks to ensure the bacteria Francisella tularensis is completely cleared from the cat’s system. Most cats, who respond favorably to initial treatment, will make a complete recovery.

Since vector transmission from fleas and ticks is a common source of infection, monthly flea and tick prevention is highly recommended. If you live in an area of high prevalence of tularemia, it may be wise to keep your cat indoors to minimize exposure and risk. 

Tularemia is a reportable disease, meaning doctors and veterinarians are required to report its diagnosis to a public health authority for contract tracing and tracking infection. 
Tularemia in Cats FAQsCan tularemia be cured? With early, aggressive care, tularemia can be successfully treated and effectively cured.
Can tularemia go away on its own?Tularemia can be fatal if left untreated. Early, aggressive treatment with IV fluids and antibiotics is highly recommended if tularemia is suspected.
How common is tularemia in cats?Tularemia mainly affects rabbits and rodent wildlife. It is considered a rare disease in cats.

52,Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection in Cats,"What Is Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection in Cats?
Tritrichomonas foetus, or T. foetus, is a common parasite that causes chronic feline large bowel diarrhea, often seen in young cats and kittens. T. foetus is especially suspected when symptoms reoccur after typical treatments of most diarrhea causes have been used.

Fortunately, this infection and the chronic diarrhea it causes is often considered more of an inconvenience than a medical emergency. However, because diarrhea has multiple causes and can lead to significant metabolic problems and dehydration, it shouldn’t be ignored. Seek help from your veterinarian promptly if your kitty has diarrhea that persists longer than a few days and has accompanying symptoms (listed below).
Symptoms of Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection
Some cats may not show any symptoms associated with T. foetus infection, especially those that are older and in otherwise good health. For most cats, though, the typical symptom is diarrhea that has an extremely bad odor and often contains mucus and/or bright red blood. Cats with T. foetus infection typically have a normal appetite and do not vomit or experience weight loss. But they can experience:


	
	Flatulence
	
	
	Straining to defecate
	
	
	Fecal dribbling/incontinence
	
	
	Inflammation of the anus
	
	
	Increased urge and frequency of defecation
	
	
	Variety of colored stool, though mostly normal
	

Causes of Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection
T. foetus is a single-celled, pear-shaped protozoan flagellated organism that takes over the cat’s small intestine and colon. Its life cycle consists of only one stage, termed a trophozoite, and once in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, this reproduces and is then shed in the feces for other cats to ingest, often attributed to grooming—where it can spread to other cats.

Tritrichomonas foetus infection has been found worldwide and in greater occurrences in multi-cat residences such as catteries and shelters. Though all cats are susceptible, young cats and kittens are more susceptible to infection in general, and purebred cats have a higher incidence of infection, probably in association with breeding facilities.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection
There are three routes of testing a veterinarian may recommend to diagnose your cat with T. foetus. Fresh fecal samples without litter contaminant are needed. Tests will include:


	
	Fecal culture: This test can be performed either in the clinic or at a reference laboratory and often increases the likelihood of detecting the organisms.

	
		In some circumstances, a saline flush procedure may be conducted, where a catheter is inserted into the cat’s anus (this often requires sedation), the colon is flushed with saline, and fecal matter is aspirated.
	
	
	
	PCR: This is the most sensitive test and requires a reference laboratory. It looks for trace DNA of the organism in your cat’s stool. 
	
	
	Fecal smear: Often performed in the clinic, this is a microscopic examination of your cat’s fresh feces.
	


Bloodwork, routine stool exams (often to rule out other parasitic causes), and imaging such as radiographs or ultrasound may be recommended.
Treatment of Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection
Often, many approaches for treating chronic diarrhea have been tried unsuccessfully before a true diagnosis of T. foetus is confirmed.  

Examples of such treatments include dietary management with a high-fiber diet or a “gastrointestinal-friendly” diet aimed at improving fecal consistency or reducing inflammation in the gut; prebiotics, probiotics, or a combination of both to help promote growth of beneficial bacteria, decrease inflammation, and aid with immune system functions; anti-diarrheal medications; and antibiotics and/or medications such as metronidazole or fenbendazole. 

Even when diagnosed, these treatments are often unsuccessful, or they may be successful at first only for symptoms to reoccur once medications are finished or the cat’s diet is changed.

Other medications such as tinidazole or ronidazole have been shown to be effective at treating T. foetus infections. Ronidazole is the medication of choice, but it must be used with caution. It should only be used in confirmed cases and by prescription from a licensed veterinarian. Talk to your vet about the risks and benefits of such medication if your cat or kitten has a T. foetus infection.  
Recovery and Management of Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection
For some cats with only mild or intermittent symptoms, or if treatment is not an option due to treatment side effects, cost, or pet parent preference, it should be noted that diarrhea due to T. foetus can resolve on its own, although it could take at least two years and the cats will remain carriers of the parasite for life.

For many cats who receive treatment, the long-term prognosis is good. The duration of the treatment is usually about two weeks, with most cats showing improvement with fecal consistency in just a few days. Diarrhea may persist for a short while after treatment as the secondary inflammation resolves.

Persistent infection can occur in about 25% of cats despite treatment, and these cats may require additional treatment of either a higher dose of medication or for a longer period of time.

Fortunately, the organism doesn’t survive very long in the environment and is easily killed by most routine disinfectants. Measures such as good litter box hygiene (scooping and cleaning daily), isolating infected cats especially during treatment, minimizing stress, and avoiding crowded living conditions are recommended. Screening of all cats in breeding facilities or shelters, when applicable, is also advised. 
Tritrichomonas Foetus Infection FAQs How do cats get Tritrichomonas foetus infection?T. foetus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, meaning for a cat to become infected, it must ingest the organism, which is shed in the feces. Litter box sharing is by far the most common mode of transmission. Indirectly, contaminated food and water bowls and ingestion of certain slugs may also be routes of transmission.
Is tritrichomonas foetus contagious to other cats?Yes. T. foetus is often passed on to other cats through shared litter boxes, as cats often ingest the organism due to their grooming habits.
Can Tritrichomonas foetus be spread from cats to humans?Fortunately, no. T. foetus has not been shown to be zoonotic (transmissible from animals to humans). Still, good hygiene and hand washing techniques are advised, and people with a weak immune system generally should refrain from changing the litter box and handling feces. Always consult your doctor with any questions regarding personalized medical advice.

53,Tremors in Cats: Why Is My Cat Shaking?,"What Are Tremors in Cats?
Tremors are shaking movements of the cat’s body that they cannot control. Sometimes these tremors look like small muscle twitches, while other times the whole body shakes and trembles.

When tremors occur it is usually due to a problem affecting a part of the brain that controls fine movement control. Movement is accomplished by different parts of the brain, nerves, spinal cord, and muscles working together. These parts are organized into three systems:


	
	Central nervous system—the brain and spinal cord
	
	
	Peripheral nervous system—all the nerves that run throughout the body
	
	
	Musculoskeletal system—the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and bones
	


The frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for planning movement and transmitting signals through the spinal cord to the motor neurons in the cat’s muscles and glands. These nerves then relay information back up the spinal cord to the brain stem, providing feedback to the brain. This feedback allows the cat to be aware of its sensations, and the muscles are activated to move in a specific way. Meanwhile, the cerebellum helps to fine-tune and correct any errors in movement.

In cases of tremors, there are problems with either the cerebellum or brain stem, which result in uncontrolled shaking throughout the cat’s body. If you notice your cat shaking, either mildly or severely, contact your veterinarian immediately.

Check your pet’s symptomSymptoms of Tremors in Cats
The most obvious symptom of this condition is uncontrollable shaking in a cat. The tremor can either be a small twitch or full-body shaking. 
Causes of Tremors in Cats
Here are some factors that can contribute to tremors in cats:


	
	Feline cerebellar hypoplasia: A disease that kittens can be born with after being exposed to the panleukopenia virus in the womb.
	
	
	Toxin exposure: Common toxins such as permethrins (found in dog flea and tick topical medications), avermectins (oral dog heartworm products), amphetamines (often found in ADHD medications), and bromethalin (rodenticide) can lead to tremors in cats.
	
	
	Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar): More common in diabetic cats who get too much insulin or young kittens that haven’t eaten in a while.
	
	
	Liver or kidney disease: Underlying diseases can cause tremors.  
	
	
	Infections: Tremors may be caused by infections such as toxoplasmosis, tetanus, and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).    
	
	
	Electrolyte imbalances: Occur in cats with a blocked urethra or significant fluid loss due to vomiting and/or diarrhea.
	
	
	Anxiety, Fear, Anticipation/Excitement: Intense emotions can sometimes result in tremors.
	
	
	Pain or injury: Muscle tremors and shivering can occur due to pain.
	
	
	Extreme body temperature: Fever or hypothermia.
	
	
	Itching sensation from fleas or other parasites: Twitching that looks like tremors can be caused by itching. Head shaking, resembling tremors, can be caused by ear mites or ear infections.
	
	
	Hyperesthesia syndrome: This condition involves twitching across the body that can look like tremors.
	
	
	Seizures and other neurologic disorders: While seizures and tremors are technically different, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two conditions.
	

How Veterinarians Diagnose Tremors in Cats
If your cat is experiencing tremors and shaking at home, your vet will begin by gathering a complete history. They will want to know how often these episodes are occurring, whether you notice any patterns as to when they occur, how long they last, and how long ago they started.

Let your veterinarian know if you have noticed any other changes in your cat’s behavior or if there have been any changes to their environment:


	Did they have access to any toxins?
	Are they eating and drinking normally?
	Have they been vomiting?
	Are they excessively drinking and urinating?
	Have you recently moved or added a new addition to the household?


If possible, it is helpful to bring a video of the shaking episode on your phone to show your cat’s veterinarian.

After a thorough history, your vet will conduct a physical examination of your cat. They may recommend blood work, a urinalysis, and X-rays to screen for underlying diseases. In some cases, specialized tests like PCR or titers may be advised, and advanced imaging such as CT and MRI scans might be considered.
Treatment of Tremors in Cats
The treatment approach for tremors in cats depends on what the underlying cause is determined to be.

If the tremors are due to acute toxicity, the cat may need to be hospitalized immediately. Intravenous (IV) fluids and decontamination methods may be needed promptly. It is crucial to note that products containing permethrin are highly toxic and quickly fatal to cats. Never apply canine flea and tick products to cats. If an accidental application does occur, immediately wash off the product with Dawn dish soap and take your cat to the nearest emergency veterinarian immediately.

If your cat has an underlying congenital disease that causes tremors, treatment may focus on providing support with medications that help to reduce the frequency of the shaking episodes or simply keep them more comfortable. In some cases, no treatment is prescribed at all if the tremors are benign or if there is no specific treatment available for the condition. This is the case with cerebellar hypoplasia, where the part of the brain responsible for fine movement did not develop correctly.

If an underlying disease is detected during veterinary testing, your cat will be treated accordingly. This could involve long-term medications, specialized diets, or regular fluid therapy.

Some common types of medications that may be prescribed for primary neurological or psychosomatic issues include:


	Nerve pain medications like gabapentin
	Muscle relaxants like methocarbamol
	Antidepressant/anti-anxiety medications like fluoxetine
	Anticonvulsants like phenobarbital


While certain causes of tremors can be cured, most cases are only managed through treatment, but some conditions have no treatment available.
Recovery and Management of Tremors in Cats
The management of a cat with tremors focuses on ensuring their safety and comfort. If your cat experiences unsteadiness during shaking episodes, be sure to prevent their access to areas such as stairs or swimming pools where they could potentially hurt themselves.

If your cat has consistent tremors that are affecting their balance, consider providing a large litter box with a low entry and high sides. This will give them something to lean on while they go to the bathroom while being less likely to tip if they stumble. Use sturdy food and water bowls and place padding around high surface areas to cushion any falls. Consider using carpet runners or other flooring that provides traction to minimize the risk of slipping and falling.

Cats with chronic tremors may be better suited to indoor life to ensure their safety, especially if muscle incoordination could hinder their ability to escape from predators. Make sure that their indoor living space is enriched with lots of toys that engage the mind and prevent heightened stress or anxiety.

Cats with chronic tremors and shaking can lead good quality lives. If your cat is shaking from a sudden onset of toxicity or disease, prompt veterinary care may be able to restore them to their normal condition.
Tremors in Cats FAQsWhat do tremors in cats look like?Tremors in cats appear as shaking of either a specific body part, such as the head or a leg, or the entire body.
 Are tremors painful for cats?Tremors themselves are not typically painful for cats; however, they can sometimes be a symptom or result of underlying pain or injury.

55,Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Urinary Tract in Cats,"Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Renal, Bladder and Urethra in Cats
 
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a malignant (aggressive) and metastasizing (spreading) cancer arising from the transitional epithelium – the highly stretchable lining of the urinary tract system – of the kidney, ureters (the tubes that carry fluid from the kidneys to the bladder), urinary bladder, urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside), prostate, or vagina.
 
The underlying cause of TCC is unknown in cats. TCC occurs most commonly in female cats.
 
Symptoms and Types


    Straining to urinate
    Frequent urination of small amounts (pollakiuria)
    Blood in urine (hematuria)
    Difficulty urinating (dysuria)
    Wetting on the floor, furniture, bed, etc. (urinary incontinence)

 
Causes
 

    Unknown

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Urine should also be sent for culture and sensitivity testing since a concurrent urinary tract infection is common.
 
X-rays of the chest and abdomen should be taken to look for possible spread of the cancer. Intravenous pyelography, a procedure that is used to take an X-ray image of the urinary system, will be used to examine the urinary tract, bladder and kidneys. For this procedure, a contrasting dye will be injected into the bloodstream, to be picked up by the kidneys and passed through through the ureters, bladder and urethra. The contrasting dye is visible on the X-ray imaging so that the internal structures can be seen and determined to be functioning normally or abnormally. Other contrast dye procedures that can be used to image the urinary tract may be used, either instead of, or in addition to, a pyelography. They include a  voiding urethrogram (x-rays of dyes as the patient urinates), or vaginogram (X-rays of dyes within the vagina). These latter X-ray techniques are indicated if urethral or vaginal disease is suspected. Double-contrast cystography is the best way to visualize the mass(es) which are normally located at the trigone of the urinary bladder (a smooth triangular area inside the bladder).


 
For a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy of the mass is the gold standard. Biopsies may be obtained through traumatic catheterization (jamming a catheter into the masses), exploratory laparotomy (abdominal surgery), or cystoscopy (using a small camera with instruments attached). However, ultrasound-guided biopsy is not recommended, because this can easily cause further spreading of the cancer.
 
Treatment
 
TCC spreads very easily. There have been multiple reports of surgery causing the cancer spread. Tube placement into the bladder (through the urethra) may greatly prolong survival times by preventing urethral blockage. Radiotherapy (ionizing radiation, like the type X-rays give off) given during surgery is reported to result in longer survival times and better local control than chemotherapy. The potential side effects of radiotherapy during surgery are urinary bladder stricture and fibrosis with urinary incontinence. 
 
Antibiotics based on the culture and sensitivity results should be prescribed to resolve any concurrent urinary tract infections.
 
Living and Management
 
While a cure is not attainable, the severity and speed of spread of TCC disease can be slowed down and delayed. Your veterinarian will schedule your cat for a contrast cystography or ultrasonography every six to eight weeks to see if treatment is effective and to screen for lymph node spread of TCC. Similarly, chest X-rays should be retaken every two to three months to detect any new cancer spread."," and Types

56,Toxoplasmosis in Cats,"What Is Toxoplasmosis in Cats?
You might have heard before that if you’re pregnant or plan to become pregnant, you should re-home your cat because of a disease called toxoplasmosis. This is a legitimate concern for pregnant people and their babies, but there’s no reason to re-home your cat because of the condition. 

Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoal parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It is a relatively common disease that is found worldwide in animals, birds, and even humans. Fortunately for our feline friends, the disease is generally mild, but given its zoonotic potential (meaning it can be transmitted to people), it is important to recognize its health implications.   

Causes of Toxoplasmosis in Cats
In order to better know how to diagnose, treat, and prevent toxoplasmosis, it’s helpful to understand the organism’s complicated lifecycle and how it infects hosts.  

In general, the parasite affects two different kinds of hosts:  


	
	Definitive—Hosts necessary for the sexual reproduction of the parasite, which are then shed in the feces as oocysts (similar to eggs). Cats are the definitive hosts for the parasites. 
	
	
	Intermediate—Hosts in which the parasite reproduces asexually, or by producing “daughter” organisms that split from the “mother” organism. Parasites in intermediate hosts pass through two distinct life stages: tachyzoites (fast-reproducing) and bradyzoites (latent form). All non-feline animals, including animals, can serve as intermediate hosts and become infected. 
	


Cats can become infected by all three T. gondii life stages (oocysts, tachyzoites, and bradyzoites) by:  


	
	Ingesting feces containing infectious oocysts 
	



	
	Eating tissues (i.e., uncooked meat or wildlife) containing the brady-/tachyzoite phases 
	
	
	Passage of tachyzoites from mother to fetus during pregnancy 
	


Once in the feline intestines, T. gondii can either produce oocysts, which are then passed in the stool, or can replicate to become tachyzoites, which migrate throughout the body, affecting multiple organs. Symptoms are variable depending on which organs become affected.  

The oocysts that are passed in the feces are not infectious at first, but they become infectious after a period ranging from 1 to 5 days, when they undergo a process called sporulation. These oocysts can remain in the environment for many months.

This remarkable ability to survive in the environment is partly to blame for their success. Researchers estimate that about a third of the human population is infected with T. gondii, and the organism has been shown to infect animals like sea otters miles away from the site of the original cat defecation after rains washed the infected feces into the watershed. While concerning, do not fret too much, there are certain precautions you can take to minimize your risk as noted below.  

Symptoms of Toxoplasmosis in Cats
Symptoms are often mild and can go unnoticed in otherwise healthy cats. Symptoms are related to the organ(s) affected by the tachyzoite, which may include: 


	
	Lethargy 
	
	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Weight Loss 
	
	
	Fever 
	



	
	Difficulty breathing 
	
	
	Jaundice 
	
	
	Behavioral Changes 
	
	
	Vision loss 
	
	
	Weakness 
	



	
	Lack of coordination/ circling 
	
	
	Neck pain 
	
	
	Seizures 
	


The prognosis depends on the severity of the diagnosis and is typically worse when the lungs or liver are involved. It’s important to note that cats who are showing symptoms are unlikely to be shedding the infectious oocysts.   

How Veterinarians Diagnose Toxoplasmosis in Cats
Diagnosing toxoplasmosis can also be challenging as oocysts are rarely identified in routine stool exams, and the identification of oocysts does not mean the cat needs to be treated. Antibody titer testing (a test to determine infections) can be performed to help exclude the disease altogether if negative, or aids in the likelihood of finding infection, if positive.

A Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test (used to examine at fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) and tissue samples (biopsies) can be analyzed for the presence of tachyzoites.

Treatment of Toxoplasmosis in Cats
Treatment in cats usually consists of a 2-4 week course of the antibiotic clindamycin and may be combined with other therapies including supportive care. It has been reported that cats shed oocysts only once in their lifetime since they develop immunity after the initial infection.  

Antibody testing can help confirm if your cat has been previously exposed.

Preventing Human Exposure to Toxoplasmosis

Below are a few helpful tips on ways you can take precautions to minimize your exposure:  


	
	Make sure to give your cat properly cooked/commercially prepared food. 
	
	
	Prevent exposure of your cat to the outdoors and ingestion of outdoor wildlife. 
	
	
	Wash all your fruits and vegetables thoroughly. 
	
	
	Avoid raw or undercooked meat and any associated kitchen utensils and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after contact. Ensuring your food is thoroughly cooked will eliminate any tachy-/bradyzoite cysts that it might have contained. 
	
	
	Wear gloves while gardening and keep sandboxes covered (or any other “cat-suitable” toilet locations). 
	



	
	Scoop the litterbox daily (it takes 1-5 days for the oocysts to become infectious, so day to week old feces pose a much higher risk). If you are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed, it is recommended to have someone else scoop the litterbox for you.  
	


Pregnant women should be more vigilant as it is known that T. gondii can cross the placenta and babies exposed can have significant birth defects.   

Recovery and Management of Toxoplasmosis in Cats
Most infected cats do not actually suffer from the disease itself, but essentially act as carriers for the disease to be promulgated so it would be rare for them to be shedding oocysts and be suffering acutely from the disease itself.   

However, if the cat does acquire the infection and tachyzoites start migrating throughout the body, it is at this point that the animal’s immune system kicks in and mounts a resistance. If it’s effective, the tachyzoites will be forced back into the bradyzoite stage and lie dormant in the unaffected organ(s). They may remain dormant for many years and are unlikely to cause future problems.  

Unfortunately, young and immunocompromised (FeLV or FIV+) cats are less likely to survive as they are less able to build a sufficient immune response and defense.
Toxoplasmosis in Cats FAQsIs toxoplasmosis in cats fatal?Toxoplasmosis is rarely fatal in cats unless they are either very young or immunocompromised, such as cats that are FIV or FeLV positive. Fortunately, once exposed and recovered, cats generally develop immunity.
Can humans contract toxoplasmosis from cats?Other animals, including people, become infected by T. gondii in much the same way as cats (contact with feces or uncooked meat). You cannot become infected through interacting with and petting cats.
What are the neurological symptoms of toxoplasmosis in cats?Neurological symptoms in cats because of toxoplasmosis can vary, but most often the cat would exhibit behavioral changes, blindness, weakness and/or lack of coordination, neck pain, circling, head pressing, and seizures.
Is toxoplasmosis found in cat litter?Toxoplasmosis can be found in cat feces, so any material a cat uses as a bathroom—such as litter, dirt, sand, or carpet—can contain the organism.

57,Tooth Resorption in Cats,"Tooth resorption in cats is a frustrating disease for both veterinarians and cat parents. It has had many names over the years, including:


	
	Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions
	
	
	Neck lesions
	
	
	Cat caries
	
	
	Cervical lesions
	


All of these different names refer to the same dental condition in cats. Here’s everything you need to know about tooth resorption in cats.

What Is Tooth Resorption in Cats?

Tooth resorption is a condition in cats where their body starts to break down and absorb the structures of a tooth.

Tooth resorption starts when “odontoclast” cells begin to attack healthy teeth.

Any tooth can be affected by tooth resorption, but the mandibular premolars (bottom cheek teeth) are most commonly diseased. 

There are two main types of tooth resorption: Type 1 and Type 2.

Feline Tooth Resorption Type 1

In Type 1 tooth resorption, areas of a diseased tooth are resorbed (broken down and absorbed) and then replaced with inflammatory granulation tissue. On dental radiographs, these areas appear to be less dense than either tooth or bone.

Feline Tooth Resorption Type 2

Teeth diseased with Type 2 tooth resorption are replaced with a bone-like material. On dental x-rays, these can look like tooth remnants in the bone.

Tooth Resorption vs. Cavities in Cats

Tooth resorption is different from cavities (aka caries) that are so common in people. Cavities are caused by bacteria that create acid. This acid breaks down the enamel and dentin of the tooth, which can kill the tooth.1 Cavities have only been noted in cats in fossils from the 13th century!2

How Common Is Tooth Resorption in Cats?

Tooth resorption was first described in cats in the 1950s. Since then, it has gotten more and more attention as the field of veterinary science evolves.

Today, tooth resorption is common in cats, with 28.5%-67% of cats diagnosed with one or more tooth resorptive lesion.3

What Causes Tooth Resorption in Cats?

While the underlying cause of tooth resorption is still unknown, researchers continue to investigate both the process and the cause of tooth resorption. Tooth resorption has not been shown to be related to bacteria in the mouth.

Researchers have investigated diets, mineral imbalances, periodontal diseases, vitamin D status, and other factors to identify the cause of feline tooth resorption. Unfortunately, a straightforward answer has not been found.

Studies have shown that cats are more likely to have tooth resorption as they age.4 They have also found that cats that are diagnosed with tooth resorption are more likely to have other teeth affected in the future.

Symptoms of Tooth Resorption

Symptoms of tooth resorption in cats can range from:


	
	Drooling
	
	
	Having difficulty chewing
	
	
	Dropping food while chewing
	
	
	“Chattering” the jaw while eating
	
	
	Running away from the food bowl
	


Many cats with tooth resorption also show no signs of pain or change in behavior at home.

How Do Vets Diagnose Tooth Resorption?

Several different conditions can cause oral pain in cats. Your veterinarian will be able to distinguish conditions like periodontal disease, feline chronic gingivostomatitis, pyogenic granulomas, and eosinophilic disease from tooth resorption by doing a sedated oral exam and taking dental radiographs of your cat’s teeth.

Stages of Tooth Resorption in Cats

There are five stages of tooth resorption that progress from a small amount of tissue loss to severe tissue loss that extends into the tooth until only remnants of dental tissue remain.5

Veterinarians evaluate each tooth to determine the type and stage of each lesion.

Treatment   

If your cat is diagnosed with a tooth resorptive lesion, your veterinarian will use dental radiographs while they are under anesthesia to make a treatment recommendation.

Without dental radiographs, a tooth resorptive lesion may just be showing the ‘tip of the iceberg,’ and it’s impossible to know how to best treat the tooth.

Treatment of Type 1 Tooth Resorption

Type 1 tooth resorptive lesions are treated with extraction of the tooth with the roots (surgical extraction).

Treatment of Type 2 Tooth Resorption

Type 2 tooth resorptive lesions can be treated with a crown amputation, which removes the diseased portion of the tooth but leaves the already resorbing roots.

Prior to extracting teeth or doing a crown amputation, your veterinarian will perform a local nerve block to reduce the amount of anesthesia your cat needs and to ensure your cat wakes up numb and comfortable.

Can You Prevent Feline Tooth Resorption?

Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent tooth resorption in cats.

Brushing your cat's teeth daily or every other day helps to decrease plaque and bacteria to slow gingivitis and periodontal disease. If your cat becomes painful or resistant to tooth brushing that they previously allowed, it may be a sign of oral pain.

Taking your cat for their yearly wellness exams, anesthetic dental exams, cleanings, and dental radiographs is the best way to prevent your cat from quietly suffering from tooth resorption. 

Your veterinarian is your best partner for diagnosis and treatment of tooth resorption.

58,Tooth Fracture in Cats,"Traumatic Tooth Injury  in Cats

Injuries involving damage to the tooth's enamel, dentin, and cement are referred to as tooth fractures. These injuries occur either on the enamel-covered top portion of the tooth (the crown) or the part below the gum line (the root).

Both dogs and cats are susceptible to traumatic tooth injuries. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms

The most common complication involving a tooth fracture is inflammation and infection. In some instances, the tooth's crown may be missing; blood or pink tissue may also be present on or around the affected area. Otherwise, cats with root fractures display constant discomfort and pain.

Causes

The most common cause of a tooth fracture is a traumatic event or injury. A tooth may be broken, for instance, by chewing on a hard object, a blunt force trauma to the face, or a minor automobile collision.

Diagnosis

To review the full extent of the tooth fracture, your veterinarian will take X-rays of the cat's mouth. A full oral examination will be completed, as well, to review the overall oral health of your cat.

Treatment

The treatment will depend on the extent and severity of cat's trauma. Crowns and other additive dental work can be applied to repair the damaged tooth, including the use of surgery when the damage is severe. Extraction may be recommended if the tooth or root cannot be repaired, followed by a sealing of the affected area with a restorative material or lining.

In many cases, restricting the cat's activities is recommended until it is fully recovered. During this time, the cat's diet should mainly consist of moist food items.

Living and Management

It is important to monitor your cat's progress following treatment, and to continue with regular tooth care and cleaning. Any damage or irritation to the gums can be detected during routine brushing or cleaning of the teeth.

The most common complications are infection or the need for a follow-up root canal.

Prevention

Prevent your cat from chewing on extremely hard substances, such as rocks, as this can damage the structure of the tooth or cause tooth breakage. Also, cats that are allowed to roam freely are at a higher risk than those who are in a contained, safe environment.","

59,Tooth Enamel Malformation in Cats,"Enamel Hypoplasia/Hypocalcification in Cats

When tooth enamel -- the outer coating of the tooth --  is allowed to develop normally it has a smooth and white appearance. Abnormal environmental or physical conditions can interfere with the development of tooth enamel, causing it to take on a discolored, pitted or otherwise unusual appearance.

Bodily influences, like a fever over an extended period of time, may cause pitting and discolored enamel surfaces. Local influences, like injury (even from baby tooth extraction) over a short period of time can cause specific patterns or bands to appear on the developing teeth. These types of traumas can result in less than normal deposits of enamel, medically termed hypocalcification. The lack of sufficient enamel may cause the teeth to be more sensitive, with exposed dentin (which is normally hidden underneath the enamel), and occasionally fractures of severely compromised teeth. The teeth usually remain fully functional.

Symptoms and Types


    Irregular, 	pitted enamel tooth surface with discoloration of diseased enamel 	and potential exposure of underlying dentin (light brown appearance)
    Early 	or rapid accumulation of plaque and calculus on roughened tooth surface
    Possible 	gingivitis and/or accelerated 	periodontal/gum disease


Causes


    Injury 	during enamel formation on the teeth
    Fever, 	trauma (e.g., accidents, excessive force used during deciduous/baby 	tooth extraction)


Diagnosis

Discolored teeth may be found by your veterinarian during a routine physical exam, which normally includes a complete oral exam. Intraoral radiographs (X-rays) can then be taken by your veterinarian to determine if the roots of the teeth are still alive.

  

Treatment

Treatment of your cat's teeth will depend upon the extent of abnormalities and the equipment and materials that are available. Your veterinarian will try to create the smoothest surface possible on the cat's teeth. Prior to receiving any dental work, your pet will be given pre-operative antibiotics and oral pain medication. Your veterinarian will try to gently remove the diseased enamel by scrubbing the enamel with special dental instruments, while taking care not to remove too much enamel and/or dentin or to overheat the insides of the teeth.

If the insides of the teeth have become exposed as the result of the hypocalcification, they will be sealed with a bonding agent that is made to protect the inside of the tooth along with its surface. A strong fluoride treatment applied to the teeth can be used in tandem with the other treatments to decrease sensitivity and enhance the enamel’s strength. It must be applied to a dry tooth surface using a varnish or strong sodium fluoride paste. This treatment will be performed under medical guidance in-hospital.

Using fluoride on your pet at home without consulting a veterinarian is not advisable, since fluoride can be toxic, and can itself cause damage to the enamel if not applied properly.

Living and Management

If your cat has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, your veterinarian will recommend regular professional dental cleaning, about once or twice a year, but possibly more depending on the condition of the teeth. Routine home-care, with a regular brushing program, will also need to be undertaken. If you are unfamiliar with tooth brushing for cats, ask your veterinarian to demonstrate the proper techniques for you.

Weekly application of stannous fluoride can be done at home, but caution is important. You will need to prevent your cat from having access to the fluoride, or from swallowing it (though a minute amount being swallowed cannot be helped), since stannous fluoride can be toxic in large doses. Excessively chewing on hard objects should also be discouraged."," and Types

60,Tooth Dislocation or Sudden Loss in Cats,"Tooth Luxation or Avulsion in Cats



There are different types of tooth luxation -- the clinical term that is given for a dislocation of the tooth from its normal spot in the mouth. The mutation can be vertical (downward) or lateral (on either side).



In vertical luxation, the tooth may move up (intrusion) or down (extrusion) in its bony socket. Vertical luxation is related to the dislocation of the root of the tooth. In lateral lunation, the tooth tips to the side. Lateral luxation usually occurs due to an injury that has pushed the tip of the tooth to one side. A tooth is called avulsed, meaning that it has been torn suddenly from its spot, if it has been luxated completely from its bony socket.



Symptoms and Types



In cases of intrusion, the affected tooth will appear shorter than normal. In cases with extrusion, the tooth appears longer than normal and can be moved both vertically and horizontally when touched. In cases of lateral luxation, the upper part of the tooth is found deviated on the either side, taking on a crooked appearance. It may be overlapping a nearby tooth to some degree. In cases where there is avulsion of the tooth, the tooth is found to have become completely displaced from its bony socket. This is most often as the result of an injury to the mouth, or to an infection at or near the tooth.



Causes




	Trauma or injury, such as with road side accidents, fights with other animals, or falls
	Cats with chronic tooth infections are at increased risk




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents -- such as recent injuries -- that might have preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination, looking closely into your cat's mouth to evaluate the teeth. The close physical examination will enable your veterinarian to see if the tooth is luxated or avulsed and whether it can be saved. The most important diagnostic test is radiographic imaging of the tooth arcade, i.e., mouth cavity. X-ray films will be placed into the oral cavity to take an X-ray of the affected teeth. Typical changes will enable your veterinarian to precisely diagnose and treat the condition.





Treatment



Surgery can usually be conducted to fix the tooth back to its normal position using various materials, including fine wires. Anesthesia will be required for conducting the surgery to prevent pain related to this procedure as well as to prevent movement by the cat. For this reason, your cat's health and any other underlying conditions will be taken into consideration, since some animals are at an increased risk for anesthesia complications and the risk may not be worth saving the tooth.





If your cat is a good candidate for the oral surgery, time is a crucial factor for the successful outcome of the surgery. The sooner the luxated or avulsed tooth is placed back in its bony socket, the better the chances are for recovery. The best results are typically achieved when the tooth is placed back in its socket within 30 minutes of its avulsion.



If you have found yourself in a situation where your cat has had its tooth forced from its mouth, by trauma or other causes, you can place the avulsed tooth in a normal saline solution to protect it from damage and take it to your veterinarian along with your cat. If you don’t have saline at home, you can also place the tooth in a small amount of milk to keep it safe until it can be delivered to your veterinarian. You should not waste time getting the avulsed tooth to the veterinarian. Once the tooth has been fixed in place again, it usually takes 4-6 weeks for the tooth to properly reimplant in the socket.



Antibiotics are standard after the surgical procedure for the prevention of infection, and a mild pain reliever may be prescribed to keep your cat comfortable. After a period of 4-6 weeks, the fixation material will be removed and X-rays will be taken to confirm the reimplantation of the affected tooth. If the tooth has not properly fixed, it will need to be removed due to fixation failure.



Living and Management

 

For a few days after the surgery, your cat should not be fed hard foods. Your veterinarian will recommend a temporary soft diet that will be beneficial to healthy bone reformation, and that will not move the tooth out of its socket during this period in which the tooth is resetting. Also during this time, to prevent further trauma to the implanted tooth, do not allow your cat to pick up solid objects with its mouth.



Maintenance and good oral hygiene after surgery is of paramount importance for the full recovery of your cat's tooth. Daily rinsing with antiseptic solution is usually required in these animals. Your veterinarian will brief you on the correct method of cleaning your cat's teeth, as well as the best procedures for removing debris, food particles and other material from the space in between the teeth, including the implanted tooth. Oral rinses are available for animals, which in many cases can be used to maintain good oral hygiene, but you should consult with your veterinarian first before including an oral rinse in your cat's oral care."," and Types

61,Too Much Acid in the Body in Cats,"Metabolic Acidosis in Cats

Acid and alkali are normal components of the blood supply, both playing very important roles in the body. The lungs and kidneys are chiefly responsible for maintaining the delicate balance between acids and alkalis. A condition of metabolic acidosis occurs when there is an increase in the levels of acid in the blood, which ultimately accumulates to abnormal levels in the body, causing various problems. This can occur due to loss of bicarbonate (alkali); acid production by increased metabolism; excess acid introduction into the body through an external source like ethylene glycol (resulting in ethylene toxicity); or by the kidney’s inability to excrete acid, which it normally does to maintain its level. Metabolic acidosis can occur in cats of any age, size, gender, or breed.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms may vary considerably, especially if your cat is concurrently compromised by other health problems like diabetes or kidney disease. The most common symptoms that you may notice in a cat that is suffering from metabolic acidosis include:


    Depression (especially if acidosis is severe)
    Rapid and deep breathing
    Diarrhea
    Vomiting
    Fever
    Confusion


Causes


    Toxicity
    Ethylene glycol (antifreeze ingestion)
    Salicylate (aspirin)
    Chronic kidney disease
    Diabetes mellitus
    Severe shock


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition (such as suspected antifreeze ingestion, or use of aspirin to treat your cat). The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms.
Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical examination on your cat. For the diagnosis of metabolic acidosis, a compete blood chemical profile will be performed to check the levels of acid and alkali in the body. The next step is to find the underlying cause of the metabolic acidosis in order to treat that problem along with correcting the acid level. Therefore, other test panels may also be used along with the blood chemical profile.



Treatment

The treatment of metabolic acidosis is usually twofold. It involves the correction of the disturbed acid-base balance as well as addressing any underlying diseases, such as diabetes and/or kidney failure. Your veterinarian will give suitable fluid therapy in order to correct the acid balance. If the acidosis is mild, your cat will be able to go home after a short treatment. However, in cases of severe or complicated acidosis, your cat may need to be hospitalized for few days until it has stabilized. Diagnosis of the underlying problem/disease causing the acidosis is crucial for preventing future episodes of metabolic acidosis.

Living and Management

After returning from the hospital, keep a close eye on your cat for few days. If your cat starts behaving in a depressed manner, or is breathing rapidly even while at rest, check with your veterinarian. This is especially important for cats dealing with some chronic health problems like diabetes, in which the next episode of metabolic acidosis may occur at any time."," and Types

The symptoms may vary considerably, especially if your cat is concurrently compromised by other health problems like diabetes or kidney disease. The most common symptoms that you may notice in a cat that is suffering from metabolic acidosis include:


    Depression (especially if acidosis is severe)

62,Tonsil Cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) in Cats,"Tonsillar Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats

The epithelium is the cellular covering of all of the internal and external surfaces of the body, protecting the organs, inner cavities and outer surfaces of the body in a continuous layer of multi-layered tissue. The squamous epithelium is a type of epithelium that consists of the outer layer of flat, scale-like cells, which are called squamous cells.

A squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsils is an aggressive and metastatic tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the tonsils. It is highly invasive and local extension into the surrounding areas is common. This tumor also metastasizes to other areas of the body, including the nearby lungs and distant organs. Middle-aged and older cats are more commonly affected, and incidence is higher in cats living in urban areas as compared to those in rural environments.

Symptoms and Types


    Difficulty with eating
    Difficulty swallowing
    Bad breath (halitosis)
    Excessive salivation
    Oral discharge with blood
    Breathing difficulties
    Weight loss


Cause


    Exact cause unknown
    Ten times more common in cats 	living in urban areas than those in rural areas; may be related to 	quality of air


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough medical history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination, which will include a thorough examination of the lymph nodes in the neck area. Abnormally large lymph nodes are indicative of an immune system response to an invasion, but only a laboratory examination of the lymph node fluid and tissue will show the type of involvement. That is, whether the invasion is bacterial, viral, or cancerous in nature.

After the initial examination, your veterinarian will order routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemical profiles, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually normal in these patients unless some concurrent disease is present. Your doctor will take a biopsy from the lymph nodes to be sent to a veterinary pathologist. This tissue sample will be processed  and analyzed microscopically for cancerous cells in order to reach a definitive diagnosis.

Your veterinarian may also take X-rays of your cat's skull and thoracic regions to search for evidence of metastasis. Skull X-rays in some patients may show bone involvement -- where the tumor has spread into the bone -- and thoracic X-rays can help identify the amount of metastasis into the lungs.



Treatment

Surgery may be used to perform an aggressive excision of the tonsils and affected tissue. However, most patients at the time of diagnosis are inoperable, either because of the location of the tumor, or the extent to which it has spread before its effects have been observed.

Removal of the affected lymph nodes may be conducted to prevent further spreading of cancerous cells, but it seldom provides a permanent cure. Radiotherapy may also be used in some patients, but its success has not been satisfactorily confirmed, so it is seldom used for these patients.

In cases where it is possible to operate and remove most of the affected area, the tumor and affected lymph nodes will be removed, and the surgery will be followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy to prevent or slow down the spread of cancerous cells to other areas of the body.

Living and Management

Good nutritional support is essential in these patients for ensuring maintenance of body weight and condition. It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. After surgery, your cat will very likely not have much of an appetite, and will not want to eat or drink in great quantities. It may be necessary to temporarily use a feeding tube. In these cases you veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly (placing it directly into the cat's stomach), and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule.

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. To minimize discomfort, your veterinarian will provide you with pain medication for your cat. In addition, you will need to set up an area in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.

Overall prognosis in affected animals is poor due to the aggressive nature of this tumor and frequency of metastasis to other body locations. Even with treatment, overall survival time generally is not more than several months. The decision to go forward with surgery or chemical therapy will be based on the actual prognosis. In some cases, end of life pain management may be in order."," and Types

63,Tongue Cancer (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) in Cats,"Lingual Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats



A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale like tissue cells are called the squamous. Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body.



Cats can be afflicted with several types of squamous cell carcinoma tumors, including in the mouth. A squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue is usually located underneath the tongue where it attaches to the bottom of the mouth. It can be white in color and sometimes has a cauliflower shape. This type of tumor grows and metastasizes quickly to other parts of the body.



As with many types of carcinomas, this is usually seen in older cats. In this case, older than seven years of age. It is otherwise rarely seen in cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Drooling
	Small white growth under the tongue
	Loose teeth
	Bad Breath (halitosis)
	Difficulty chewing and eating (dysphagia)
	Lack of appetite
	Blood coming from the mouth
	Weight loss




Causes



There is no known cause for squamous cell carcinomas on the tongue.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as accidental ingestion of a toxic substance that might have led to mouth sores, or other injury to the mouth.



A full visual inspection will be made of your cat's mouth and tongue, and a sample will be taken from the tumor for laboratory analysis. This is the only concrete way to determine whether the tumor is malignant or benign. X-ray images will also be taken of your cat's head and chest to determine if the cancer has spread into the bones, lungs, or brain. Your veterinarian will palpate your cat's lymph nodes to check for swelling – an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease, and a sample of the lymph fluid will be taken to test for the presence of cancerous cells.



Standard tests include a complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your cat's other organs are functioning normally.







Treatment



There are not many effective treatments for these tumors, since many tumors are too large to be removed without causing significant disability, or they are in a location where they cannot practicably be removed. However, sometimes cats with tumors close to the front, or on one side of the tongue can be treated with surgery. If this is the case, part of the tongue will be removed along with the tumor. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, it may not be possible to remove it in its entirety. For cases such as this, your veterinarian will counsel you on the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for stopping or slowing regrowth of the tumor.



Cats that have part of their tongue removed generally recover well after surgery but may have trouble eating for some time during the recovery process. Your veterinarian will help guide you in creating a meal plan for your cat. Choices will be limited to soft or liquid foods, and in some cases, a feeding tube may be required until your cat's mouth has healed sufficiently. The feeding tube is usually placed directly in the stomach. If this is necessary, your veterinarian will guide you in the proper technique for placing the tube.

 

Living and Management



If your cat had surgery to remove part of its tongue, it will likely need a feeding tube when it comes home with you. This tube will need to be kept in place until your cat's tongue and mouth have recovered from surgery. Your veterinarian will help you to plan a meal schedule and will recommend the foods that will be best for your cat during recovery. Be sure to follow your veterinarian's directions closely. Once the feeding tube is removed, your cat will need to continue with a soft food that is easy to digest. You may find that it is helpful to encourage your cat to eat from your hand, using small amounts of food at a time, until it is eating well on its own again.



It is characteristic for carcinomas to return after surgery. While each animal responds differently, in most cases a cat will do well for a few months after treatment or surgery before the disease returns."," and Types

64,Toad Poisoning in Cats,"What Is Toad Poisoning in Cats? 
All species of toads are poisonous. However, most toads do not cause severe poisoning with two important and deadly exceptions—the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius, formerly known as Bufo alvarius) and the marine toad (Rhinella marina, formerly Bufo marinus, also known as the cane toad). These large toads are also often referred to as “Bufo toads.” Toads contain glands that secrete a thick, creamy white substance that is toxic to dogs and cats. 

In the United States, the primary locations where toad poisonings occur are Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Hawaii, and Florida. Most exposures happen in the summer months and in the evening, especially after it rains—this is when toads are most active.

In cats, toad poisoning can occur from licking, mouthing, or eating the Bufo toads. Even drinking water from a dish where a toad was sitting, or from a pond containing toad eggs, can result in poisoning. The toxin is extremely irritating and is typically absorbed through the cat’s gums, causing drooling within seconds. The toad secretions contain toxins that can cause hallucinations, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms, trouble breathing, or even death. 

Exposure to bufo toads can be deadly and is considered an absolute medical emergency. If you think your pet may have had contact with one, seek veterinary care immediately. 
Colorado River Toad | Image Credit: iStock.com/Mirko_RosenauMarine or Cane Toad | Image credit: iStock.com/ Patrick_GijsbersHow Are Toads Poisonous to Cats? 

Bufo toads are poisonous to cats due to the toxic secretions produced by their glands. The toxicity can vary based on the size and dose. For example, larger toads have larger glands and produce more secretions. Potency of the toxin can also vary with species and geographic location. Toads excrete more of these toxic substances when they feel threatened—like when they are approached by a cat.

Toads are poisonous at all stages of life, including as tadpoles and eggs. When a cat licks, mouths, or eats a toad, the toxic substances are absorbed through the cat’s mouth, open wounds, or other mucus membranes.

Symptoms of Toad Poisoning in Cats 
Clinical signs associated with toad poisoning are rapid, often starting within a few seconds or minutes. Most symptoms are seen within one hour of contact with a Bufo toad. Clinical signs may include:


	
	Drooling/foaming at the mouth
	
	
	Pawing at the face and mouth
	
	
	Shaking the head
	
	
	Vocalizing/crying
	
	
	Red gums
	
	
	Retching/vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Stumbling/lack of coordination
	
	
	Tremors/seizures
	
	
	Trouble breathing
	
	
	Increased or decreased heart rate
	
	
	Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
	


The heart and neurologic clinical signs can be life-threatening. 

Your Cat Ate a Toad. Now What?

If you suspect that your cat may have licked, chewed on, or eaten a toad, take them immediately to a veterinarian. Often, you may see your cat playing with or attacking a toad, but other times you may find the cat drooling and disoriented. Because toad toxic secretions are rapidly absorbed and can quickly lead to death, do not delay in seeking care. 

Toads are generally not harmful to humans, but humans can have allergic reactions to the toxic substances they secrete. Also, unhealthy toads can transmit the Salmonella bacteria to humans when touched. For these reasons, it is better to take a photo of the toad rather than try to catch it for identification purposes.

Immediate flushing of the cat’s mouth with large amounts of water can decrease the amount of poison absorbed and reduce the severity of the clinical signs. However, cats do not appreciate having their mouth flushed out, and delaying their care may be deadly. If your cat allows you to do so without biting or scratching you, try to wipe their gums and mouth with a clean, moist cloth and then head immediately to the vet. Any additional flushing is best performed by veterinary staff. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Toad Poisoning in Cats 
To diagnose toad poisoning in your cat, your veterinarian will collect a thorough history, including any eyewitness descriptions or photos of the toad, if available, to help identify whether it is a Bufo toad. If cats are witnessed with the toad, diagnosis is more straightforward. If unwitnessed, however, vets must use clinical signs and a level of suspicion, as there are no readily available diagnostic tests to confirm toad poisoning.    

Your veterinarian will start with a thorough physical examination to assess the heart, lungs, and neurologic status. An electrocardiogram, or EKG, may be performed to assess the rhythm of the heart and check for abnormal beats. A chest x-ray may be recommended to check for any fluid in the lungs. Also, a complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended as a baseline evaluation. 

Treatment of Toad Poisoning in Cats 
Cats with toad poisoning must be treated as early as possible. Due to the rapid absorption and possible neurologic symptoms, most vets will not recommend inducing vomiting.

Once at the hospital, your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination, including a complete neurological examination, as well as check for fever and listen to the heart and lungs. Additional flushing of the mouth will likely be performed. 

Your pet will likely be given IV fluids to help maintain blood pressure and support hydration. Other therapies may be administered to reduce the amount of saliva, correct abnormal heart rhythms, stop seizures, or treat nausea. Oxygen therapy may also be needed.

Recovery and Management of Toad Poisoning in Cats 
Early and aggressive treatment is crucial for a good outcome for toad poisonings in cats. Prognosis will vary depending on the species of toad encountered, amount of secretions ingested, time from poisoning to start of treatment, and your pet’s response to therapy. Fortunately, in cats that do respond well, clinical signs typically resolve within 30 minutes of treatment. 

Most cats experiencing toad poisoning will remain hospitalized for 24-48 hours for continued supportive care and medications. Monitoring will likely include repeating an EKG to monitor the heart and rechecking bloodwork, particularly electrolytes and kidney values. If the cat survives the poisoning, there are usually no long-term effects. 

Prevention of Toad Poisoning in Cats

Avoiding dangerous toads is the best way to prevent toad poisoning in cats. If you live in an area known to have Bufo toads, consider keeping your cat indoors. Or if your feline friend loves the outdoors, consider supervised time on a harness with a leash, or in a catio to allow them to have safe outdoor time. Bufo toads are generally nocturnal, so take extra care at night, especially after it rains, when toads are most active.

65,Ticks and Tick Control in Cats,"Ticks are parasitic organisms that attach themselves to the skin of dogs, cats, and other mammals by using their mouth parts. These parasites feed on the blood of their hosts and can cause toxicosis or hypersensitivity, and in some cases blood loss anemia. Ticks can also be transmitters of bacterial or viral diseases. The skin, the lymphatic and immune systems, and the nervous systems, can be negatively affected if gone untreated. Ticks come in 4 stages: egg, larvae, nymph, and adult.



Symptoms



Ticks may be visibly present on the cat's body, especially as they (the ticks) grow. Ticks have a hard backed shield and can be felt as small bumps during a palpation of the skin, or during regular petting. There may also be other symptoms present if a tick borne disease develops.



Causes



Ticks are attracted to hosts for the warmth, presence of carbon dioxide on the skin, and other associated odors that the host gives off. Cats acquire ticks by being in direct physical contact with environments that harbor ticks (e.g., high grass areas, wooded areas, etc.).



Diagnosis



Your cat's skin will be inspected to look for ticks or tick feeding cavities, and laboratory tests will be ordered to review the blood for blood borne illnesses or other tick related illnesses that may have developed.







Treatment



The removal of ticks is done on an outpatient basis and is performed immediately upon observing them on the cat's body.



Living and Management



Wash the cat's skin thoroughly to prevent local inflammation or a secondary infection.



Prevention



To avoid contact with ticks, avoid environments such as wooded areas that may harbor ticks. Maintained yards, meanwhile, are less likely to encourage ticks. The tick does not jump, so it depends on long grass, shrubs, etc, to latch onto passing animals.



Free-roaming cats are most at risk, and should be checked regularly to prevent long term contact with ticks. The longer the tick stays in contact with the cat, the more likely the risk of disease transmission.","

66,Tick Paralysis in Cats,"What Is Tick Paralysis in Cats?
Tick paralysis is a neurotoxic condition in cats (and dogs) after a tick bite. It occurs mainly in the United States and Australia, and less commonly in parts of Europe and Asia. In the United States, female ticks of the genera Dermacentor and Ixodes are typically responsible for secreting neurotoxins in their bite.

Ticks have four life stages:


	
	Eggs
	
	
	Larvae
	
	
	Nymph (young adult)
	
	
	Adult
	


Female ticks lay up to a few thousand eggs per litter. These remain as eggs for about two months, then hatch to become larvae, which start to search for blood. They feed for about 5 days before falling off the first host and undergoing the change to young adult.

After molting into a young adult, a tick takes blood from its second host, and if many young adults are present on the host, they can cause paralysis. Ticks are most likely to cause tick paralysis after molting into an adult and after latching onto their second host. Their saliva transmits the neurotoxins responsible for tick paralysis.

Symptoms of Tick Paralysis in Cats
Neurotoxins secreted in the saliva of affected ticks, then transferred to a cat’s bloodstream through a bite, cause rapidly progressing neurologic signs that start with weakness in the cat’s hind limbs and ascend to cause weakness in the forelimbs. Paralysis of all four legs can follow.

Less commonly, cranial nerves may become involved. This causes trouble swallowing and change in voice/meow.

In even more serious cases, respiratory distress can develop due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, possibly causing respiratory failure. Signs associated with this disease will progress rapidly if the tick is not removed promptly.

Causes of Tick Paralysis in Cats
Tick paralysis is contracted through a bite from an affected tick, and clinical signs are seen anywhere from 8 hours to 5 days after the bite occurs.

Tick paralysis is not contagious to other pets or humans. The disease can only be contracted through a tick bite.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Tick Paralysis in Cats
Unfortunately, there is no definitive test for tick paralysis. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, the discovery of an engorged tick on the pet, and improvement/resolution of clinical signs with the removal of the tick and/or treatment with an anti-tick product.

Physical examination can reveal respiratory and neurologic signs, such as:


	
	Fast, labored, rasping, snoring, or obstructed breathing
	
	
	Trouble swallowing
	
	
	Weakness and lack of coordination
	
	
	Change in meow
	


Routine blood work may show evidence of concurrent tick-borne disease but does not indicate tick paralysis. While imaging, such as X-rays and CT scans, cannot confirm tick paralysis, it may reveal signs of lung disease that are secondary to tick paralysis.

Treatment of Tick Paralysis in Cats
The first step in treating tick paralysis is a thorough physical examination and removal of all ticks. In furry pets, this may require shaving to ensure that all ticks are removed. The ticks need to be removed in full, including all their mouth parts, to ensure there is no further toxin release. If you can, take a picture of any ticks removed from your pet; your veterinarian may find it helpful in identifying the species.

Supportive therapy, depending on the clinical signs that develop, may include:


	
	Fluid therapy
	
	
	Physical therapy
	
	
	Assisted feeding
	
	
	Urinary bladder management
	
	
	Antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and occasionally mechanical ventilation if lung disease is also present
	


Tick preventatives are essential to avoiding future infestations and additional episodes of tick paralysis.

Recovery and Management of Tick Paralysis in Cats
In general, with appropriate care and removal of ticks, the prognosis for tick paralysis is good. Most deaths are from respiratory arrest secondary to low oxygen levels or aspiration pneumonia. After your cat recovers, appropriate tick prevention is needed for life, and some cats may require physical therapy for a period to regain their muscle strength.

Prevention of Tick Paralysis in Cats

To prevent tick paralysis from occurring or recurring, use appropriate monthly tick preventatives. You can also regularly check your cat for ticks and keep your cat indoors to avoid exposure. Please contact your veterinarian to discuss which preventative would be most appropriate.

Neurotoxins secreted in the saliva of affected ticks, then transferred to a cat’s bloodstream through a bite, cause rapidly progressing neurologic signs that start with weakness in the cat’s hind limbs and ascend to cause weakness in the forelimbs. Paralysis of all four legs can follow.

Less commonly, cranial nerves may become involved. This causes trouble swallowing and change in voice/meow.

In even more serious cases, respiratory distress can develop due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, possibly causing respiratory failure. Signs associated with this disease will progress rapidly if the tick is not removed promptly.

67,Thyroid Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Thyroid Gland Adenocarcinoma in Cats

The importance of the thyroid gland is many fold. It is responsible for a variety of bodily functions, most notably the coordination of hormones and normal metabolism. Adenocarcinoma of the thyroid gland is like other adenocarcinomas: it grows rapidly and can metastasize to other parts of body. Adenocarcinoma of the thyroid is more commonly seen in older cats, but young cats may also suffer from this neoplasm.

The element iodine is also suspected of playing a role in the dysfunction of the thyoid gland. Because iodine is essential for the thyroid to work properly, cats living in iodine deficient areas may be at higher risk of developing these neoplasms.

Symptoms and Types

Following are some of the symptoms commonly related to adenocarcinoma of the thyroid.


    Large fixed or movable mass over 	cat’s trachea covering the larynx
    Dyspnea (difficult breathing)
    Dysphagia (difficulty in 	swallowing)
    Weight loss
    Dysphonia (hoarseness)
    Polydipsia (increased thirst)
    Polyuria (increased amount and/or 	frequency of urine passing)


Causes

The cause of thyroid adenocarcinoma is still unknown.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, with blood tests, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. The most informative and helpful test is the T4 (thyroxine) and/or free T4 concentration determination. Thyroxine is a primary hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its level tends to increase in some patients with adenocarcinoma of the thyroid gland. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels will also be determined, along with T4. TSH is another hormone released from the brain which controls the release of T4 hormone. X-ray and ultrasound imaging, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are some of the diagnostic tools your veterinarian can use to confirm the diagnosis and to determine whether the tumor has metastasized. Your veterinarian may also perform a biopsy of the thyroid tissue to see if malignant cells are present in the thyroid gland.



Treatment

There is no curative treatment yet available for this neoplasm of the thyroid gland in cats. Surgery may be employed for partial or complete removal of the thyroid gland, along with the neoplastic tissue. As this area has an extensive blood supply, it is possible for hemorrhage to occur during surgery, requiring a transfusion of blood to the patient. Other protocols used for treatment of a thyroid gland adenocarcinoma include radiotherapy and chemotherapy. If the thyroid gland is removed, your veterinarian may prescribe the iodine supplement thryoxine to be given orally to your cat in order to maintain other body functions that are dependent upon thyroxine. Thyroxine supplementation will be given for the life time of your cat.

Living and Management

Cats that have been treated for thyroid adenocarcinoma should be encouraged to rest if activity causes breathing problems. As much as possible, keep your cat in a low stress environment. The heart rate in these patients tends to fluctuate, so your cat may collapse unexpectedly at any time. Contact your veterinarian immediately in such a situation. Follow your veterinarian's treatment guidelines, especially in giving the chemotherapeutic agents at home. Many chemotherapeutic agents can be hazardous to your health if not handled properly, consult with your veterinarian on the best handling practices."," and Types

68,Throat Cancer (Chondrosarcoma) in Cats,"Chondrosarcoma of the Larynx and Trachea in Cats



A chondrosarcoma is a relatively rare and fast spreading tumor that originates in the cartilage, a connective collagenous tissue that is found throughout the body. Chondrosarcomas are one of several types of laryngeal tumors that can effect the larynx and trachea of a cat.



Over time, this type of tumor progresses, aggressively involving the surrounding tissues. As with many sarcomas, chondrosarcomas of the larynx and trachea are more common in middle aged and older cats. All breeds are at risk, but males are often at a slightly higher risk than females.



Symptoms and Types



Most symptoms are related to involvement of larynx, trachea and surrounding tissues.




	Changes in voice
	Loss of purr
	Harsh, noisy breathing
	Poor exercise stamina
	Difficulty in respiration, cat may breath with mouth open
	Loud noises while breathing
	Bluish mucous membranes
	Sudden collapse
	Difficulty in ingesting food
	Inability to swallow




Causes



The exact cause is still unknown.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will need a complete background medical history leading up to your cat's disease symptoms. Routine blood tests include a complete blood cell count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and platelet count. The results are frequently normal in such cases.



Radiographic studies of the neck and chest can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, along with imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scans. Another technique your veterinarian may choose is bronchoscopy, by which a tubular device is inserted into the body, in this case through the mouth and down into the windpipe, so that a more detailed visual examination can be conducted. This type of instrument can also sometimes be used to take a sample of tissue for biopsy, alleviating the need for a more invasive presurgical resection at the site.



Samples of fluid from the surrounding area may also be taken, and samples from the lymph nodes may show an abnormal amount of white blood cells, as the immune system reacts to the cancerous tumor.



Radiographs of the area will show whether metastasis has taken place.







Treatment



Being aggressive and malignant in nature, a chondrosarcoma of the larynx and trachea is usually life-threatening. Your veterinarian will need to excise the tumor tissue and possibly the surrounding tissue. As this tumor can affect very vital site of body, preservation of functions is very important. Your veterinarian will also be working to preserve your cat's laryngeal functions. The affected part of the trachea will need to be removed entirely by resection, and both ends of the normal trachea sutured together, a surgical process referred to as anastomosis. Radiotherapy is generally not effective in patients with chondrosarcoma of the larynx and trachea.



Living and Management



A cat that has been affected by this type of cancer may survive for a few months, but because of the malignant nature of this cancer, even after successful treatment the life span of such patients is quite low. Quality of life is another important consideration and many owners will arrange for peaceful euthanasia of their cats rather than force them to undergo the stress of surgery.



Good nutritional support is essential in these patients for ensuring maintenance of body weight and condition. It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. After surgery, your cat will very likely not have much of an appetite, and will not want to eat or drink in great quantities. It may be necessary to temporarily use a feeding tube placed directly into the stomach so that it is getting all of the nutrition it needs to completely recover. Your veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule.



After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.

69,Thickening of the Uterine Lining and Fluid Filled Sac in Cats,"What is Pyometra in Cats?
Pyometra is an infection in the uterus. The term stems from the Latin words “pyo” (which means pus) and “metra” (which means uterus or womb). Translated, it means pus in the uterus. This condition occurs more frequently in older, unspayed female cats that have had several heat cycles in their lives without getting pregnant. Pyometra most commonly occurs in cats that have been in heat within the past month.  

When a cat is ready to mate and have kittens, she goes into “heat.” Heat is a term describing hormone changes inside the female animal’s body that makes them more receptive to getting pregnant. During this phase, your cat may be excessively vocal (yowling often) or stick her rear end up in the air. Following a heat cycle, hormones change, making it easier for bacteria to enter the uterus, grow and cause an infection.  

While pyometra is an uncommon condition in cats it can be life-threatening and requires emergency medical treatment.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Pyometra in Cats
The symptoms of pyometra can vary from subtle (almost unnoticeable) to severe lethargy, vomiting and weakness. Symptoms vary greatly because of a female cat’s opening from the vagina to the uterus called the cervix. This part of the body opens, or dilates, during labor and delivery, as well as during heat. It then closes following heat (or after a cat gives birth). If the cervix is still open, when pyometra develops, the pus can drain out of the body. Cats with an open cervix, or “open pyometra,” are much less sick than those with a closed cervix, “closed pyometra.”  

When the cervix is closed, it traps the pus inside the uterus which can result in the pet becoming septic and toxic shock developing quickly.  

Common signs of pyometra include:  


	
	Pus draining from the vulva: This can be difficult to spot because cats are very meticulous about grooming. Watch for any drainage around the base of the tail or on bedding.  
	
	
	Lethargy, depression, or weakness 
	
	
	Anorexia or decreased appetite 
	
	
	Increased thirst 
	



	
	Vomit or diarrhea 
	
	
	Fever 
	


Causes of Pyometra in Cats
Pyometra occurs in older intact female cats who have never given birth. This is because when a cat undergoes a heat cycle, several hormonal changes occur inside her uterus including thickening of the uterus walls. These changes are meant to prepare her body for pregnancy. Chronic thickening of the uterus walls without pregnancy may lead to a cyst forming in the walls of the uterus. Uterine cysts release fluid that feeds bacteria.  

The cat’s cervix also opens to allow sperm to enter. Meanwhile, her white blood cells that usually protect her from infection, are prevented from the uterus to protect the sperm. Unfortunately, this also protects bacteria, allowing it to rapidly multiply and grow in the uterus. As bacteria grows, pus accumulates and causes pyometra in cats.  

Rarely, a spayed cat may develop a pyometra, which is called a “stump pyometra.” When a female cat is spayed, her entire reproductive tract is removed, including the ovaries and the uterus. A stump pyometra occurs when an infection happens in the small amount of tissue (‘stump’) left behind after a spay is completed. This is very uncommon in cats.  

How Veterinarians Diagnose Pyometra in Cats
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough exam and review your cat’s health history. The veterinarian may ask the date of your cat’s last heat cycle and about any unusual behaviors at home including excessive drinking, wet spots, or discharge on your cat’s bedding.  

Your veterinarian will also perform tests, which may include: 


	
	X-rays  
	
	
	Blood work  
	



	
	Urinalysis 
	


Diagnosing a pyometra in cats can be challenging when it is an open pyometra. Your vet may perform an ultrasound because this technique is more sensitive than x-ray and can detect changes in uterine size.  

Treatment of Pyometra in Cats
Pyometra in cats is most commonly treated by spaying the animal and removing the source of the infection. This involves surgically removing both the ovaries and the uterus.  

Surgically removing the entire infected uterus is the preferred treatment for pyometra, but there are possible alternatives that may potentially be used to treat cats that pet parents are planning to breed in the future.  

These alternate treatments are less reliable and carry more risks, but may be an option for breeding cats. One option is administering prostaglandins, a type of hormone, that induce uterine contractions and open the cervix. This may help expel the bacteria and be managed with antibiotics after the procedure.  

Recovery and Management of Pyometra in Cats
Routine spay surgeries typically require very little hospitalization time however, cats who undergo surgery to treat a pyometra are often quite sick. They typically stay in the hospital on IV fluids for a few days following surgery. Recovery time may vary depending on how sick the pet is prior to surgery.  

Following surgery, limit your cat's activity for about 2 weeks to allow time to completely heal. During this time, your cat should not run or jump, and may require being kept in a large crate that has room for her litter box and water bowl.  

You should also regularly check her incision for excessive redness or drainage. To prevent her from licking or chewing at her incision, she may require an E-Collar (plastic or cloth cone). She will likely require oral antibiotics; however your veterinarian may be able to administer a long-acting antibiotic instead. Please be sure to follow your veterinarian’s instructions and do not discontinue her antibiotic before the medication course is completed.   
Pyometra in Cats FAQsHow does pyometra occur?Pyometra occurs in older, intact female cats that have undergone multiple heat cycles without getting pregnant. It occurs when hormone changes make the uterus more susceptible to bacterial infections. Following these chronic changes, bacteria travels into the uterus from the vulva and replicates, forming pus. This pus makes the pet feel sick as their immune system struggles to fight the bacteria.
When does pyometra occur?Pyometra most commonly occurs in cats that have had a heat cycle in the past 4 weeks.
What happens if pyometra goes untreated?If left untreated, a pet with pyometra may become septic as the bacteria travels from the uterus into the bloodstream. This can result in toxic shock, and even death.

70,The Ultimate Guide to Cat Anxiety,"Anxiety is the anticipation of a danger or threat. So even though your cat is not actually in danger, they are anticipating it. Cat anxiety can cause bodily reactions and changes in your cat’s behavior.

An anxious cat may have physical reactions such as increased heart and respiratory rates, panting, trembling, and salivation. The most obvious behavior changes are increased movement, hiding, destruction, and excessive vocalization.

Many fears, phobias, and anxieties develop as a result of experiences in the first year of a cat’s life. Pet parents often first notice signs of cat anxiety between 5 months and 1 year of age. These anxieties usually get worse, or new concerns may develop when your cat is between 1 and 3 years old.

That’s why it’s important to take steps to treat your cat’s anxiety as soon as possible. This guide will explain common cat anxiety symptoms, what might be causing the anxiety, and treatment options you can try.

Signs of Cat Anxiety

If your cat has anxiety, you may notice pacing or restlessness, hiding, decreased appetite, vocalization, hypervigilance, trembling, salivation, and excessive grooming.

Here are some other signs of cat anxiety and fear, from mild to severe: 

Mild Signs of Cat Anxiety


	
	Avoiding eye contact
	
	
	Shifting body or head away
	
	
	Holding their tail close to their body
	
	
	Slight tail flicking
	
	
	Partially dilated pupils
	


Moderate Signs of Cat Anxiety


	
	Ears partially to the side
	
	
	Increased dilation of the pupils
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Looking at the stimulus
	
	
	Holding their tail tight against their body
	
	
	Crouching and leaning away
	


Severe Signs of Cat Anxiety


	
	Trying to escape or completely freezing in place
	
	
	Fully dilated pupils
	
	
	Holding their ears back
	
	
	Hair standing up
	
	
	Staring
	
	
	Aggression
	


What to Do When Your Cat Is Anxious or Scared

If you see signs of anxiety, follow these tips.

Try Comforting Your Cat

When your cat is having a moderate or severe fear response, it is okay to attempt to comfort or soothe your cat. This does not “reward” the fearful behavior, contrary to popular belief.

Never Punish Your Cat 

Absolutely avoid punishment for behavior related to fear, phobia, or anxiety, as this will only increase the fear response. It can even lead to aggression toward the person administering the punishment. This includes techniques like yelling at and squirting your cat with a water bottle.

Don’t Try to Confine Them

Don’t try to put your cat into a carrier when they are anxious, as not all cats calm down when crated. In fact, some panic when caged or confined and will injure themselves, biting or scratching at the cage until they have torn nails or broken teeth.  

Causes of Cat Anxiety

Many things can cause cat anxiety, including:

Illness or Physical Pain

Any illness or painful physical condition can contribute to the development of your cat’s anxieties or exacerbate ones that already exist.

Aging-related changes in the nervous system, infectious diseases, and toxic conditions (such as lead poisoning) may lead to behavioral problems including fears, phobias, and anxieties.

Trauma

Fear often results from a traumatic experience.

Remember that an experience that didn’t seem traumatic to you may have seemed very traumatic to your cat—all that matters is that your cat found it traumatic, whether you think it was or not.

Improper Socialization

Cats that are deprived of positive social and environmental exposures during the socialization period (7 to 12 weeks of age) may become habitually fearful or anxious.

Cat anxiety and phobias can form when your cat can’t escape or get away from a stimulus, such as being confined during fireworks or living with a pet that frightens them.

Being Separated From You (Separation Anxiety)

Separation anxiety is a common specific anxiety in companion animals, making up 10-20% of cases referred to veterinary behaviorists. If a cat has separation anxiety, it means that when they’re alone, they exhibit anxiety or excessive distress behaviors.

Separation anxiety in cats can be caused by a history of rehoming, growing up in a home where people are home most of the time, having only one family member, and noise phobia. Being abandoned or rehomed because of separation anxiety can make it even worse.

How Do Vets Determine the Cause of Cat Anxiety?

Your veterinarian will first want to rule out other conditions that might be contributing to your cat's behavior, such as pain or thyroid disease.

This consists of a thorough physical exam, blood tests, and urine tests. Additional tests may be recommended depending on your cat’s results.

A thorough history is an essential part of establishing a diagnosis, and any videos you have of the behavior are also helpful. These will provide clues to the stimuli and situations that cause your cat to be anxious, if there is no medical cause found. 

How Do You Treat Anxiety in Cats?

Treatment for behavior disorders like cat anxiety often involves a combination of management of your cat’s environment, giving supplements or medications for cat anxiety, and trying behavior modification. Any underlying medical conditions need to be treated as well.

If left untreated, these disorders are likely to progress. Most treatment options will be long-term, possibly years, depending on the number and intensity of symptoms and how long the condition has been going on. The minimum treatment averages four to six months.

Managing Cat Anxiety

Management involves avoiding situations that cause your cat fear or anxiety.

If your cat is severely affected and needs to be protected until medications can become effective, which can take several days to a few weeks, hospitalization may be the best choice.

Otherwise, you will need to care for your cat at home and provide protection from self-inflicted physical injury until your cat calms down.

Your cat may need to live in a protected environment with as few stressors as possible. A cat that has a fear of unfamiliar people, for example, should not be exposed to new houseguests.

Cat Anxiety Medicine

Most cats respond to some degree to a combination of behavior modification and treatment with cat anxiety medicine or supplements.

Medications like antidepressants take several weeks to work. They change your cat’s brain chemistry to reduce their stress. Some cats remain on them for years, and others can be weaned off after a few months.

The primary goal is for your cat to be calm and happy, not to turn them into a zombie or change their personality.

There are also shorter-acting medications for cat anxiety that work within one to three hours. These are good for predictable events that do not last very long. For example, your vet may prescribe something for your cat to take only before fireworks on the Fourth of July or before going to the vet.

As long as your cat is on medications, your veterinarian will want to follow up by conducting occasional blood testing to make sure your cat's blood chemicals stay in balance.

Behavior Modification to Relieve Cat Anxiety

If you try behavior modification, it will be up to you to put in the time and effort. As with all illnesses, it is best to start treatment early.

You will need to teach your cat some coping skills that can be used in a variety of settings. The goal of behavior modification is to change how your cat feels about a frightening stimulus (like thunder). This change improves a cat’s prognosis instead of indefinitely avoiding the stimulus.

Two methods of behavior modification that may be recommended by your vet are desensitization and counterconditioning. Both of these methods require specific timing and the ability to read your cat’s body language and decode your cat’s tail movements to notice the earliest signs of fear and stress.

Ask for help from your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist. If behavior modification does not work over the long-term, your veterinarian may want to modify the approach.

Desensitization

Desensitization is the repeated, controlled exposure to the stimulus that usually causes a fearful or anxious response. The key is that you expose your cat to the stimulus at a low level so that your cat does not show any signs of fear or stress.

A popular version involves playing a sound that your cat is afraid of at such a low volume that there is no fear or stress. After playing the sound three or four times at a low volume without a reaction, then you can increase the volume very slightly and repeat the process.

It is essential that your cat is showing no signs of fear or stress before you increase the volume. Note that desensitization does not mean exposing the cat to the frightening stimulus repeatedly and expecting their fear to suddenly resolve. This approach only makes your cat worse.

Counterconditioning

Counterconditioning alters the emotional response to a stimulus from a negative to a positive one.

For example, a cat that is afraid of the family dog could be fed her favorite treat every time she sees the dog. Over time, her response to seeing the dog can change from fear to the good feelings associated with the special treat.

Is There a Way to Prevent Newly Adopted Cats From Becoming Anxious? 

When adopting a cat, look for one that is friendly with people and confident. The socialization period for kittens ends at 7 weeks old, but research has shown that proper socialization can benefit a cat up to 14 weeks old.

Expose your cat to a variety of social situations and environments in an overwhelmingly positive way when they are still young to decrease the likelihood of fearful behavior. This doesn’t mean forcing your cat to endure stressful situations. Remember that taking a cat into situations where it is clearly moderately or severely fearful for them will actually make things worse.

71,Tetralogy of Fallot in Cats,"Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital defect of the heart that involves four abnormalities: a ventricular septal defect (a hole between the two ventricles), pulmonic stenosis (obstruction of blood flow through the pulmonary valve), an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of the heart muscle).

Symptoms and Types


    Weakness
    Fainting
    Shortness of breath
    Cyanosis


Causes

Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital disease that likely is influenced by genetic factors.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will start with a physical examination on your cat, which may reveal a heart murmur. Routine blood testing may be recommended. Your veterinarian will likely want to take radiographs (X-rays) of the heart and an ultrasonic study of the heart (known as an echocardiogram) will probably be necessary as well. Other testing that may be pursued include an electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (measurement of hemoglobin saturation), and/or angiocardiography.



Treatment

Exercise restriction is important when dealing with cats with Tetralogy of Fallot in order to reduce the strain on the heart. Periodic phlebotomy may be necessary to maintain an appropriate packed cell volume. Palliative surgical procedures have been advocated to improve blood flow. Medications such as propanolol may be beneficial in controlling symptoms associated with this defect."," and Types

72,Testicular Tumor (Seminoma) in Cats,"Seminoma in Cats

Seminoma is a benign (not recurrent or progressive), unilateral tumor of the testis that is extremely rare in male cats (one case of malignant tumor with metastasis has been reported. Typically measuring less than two centimeters in diameter, a seminoma often causes no clinical symptoms in the affected cat and is therefore difficult to identify.

Symptoms and Types

Although seminomas rarely causes any clinical symptoms in the animal, some cats exhibit pain due to pressure from the growing tumor. In a few cases, the testicular mass can be palpapated. Even rarer still, some tumors can become malignant and metastasize to other parts of the body.

Causes

Seminomas develop due to cryptorchidism, a fetal abnormality which occurs when one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum from where they develop in the abdomen.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination, searching for a testicular mass and whether or not it is palpable. Cats with a seminoma may exhibit pain or abnormally large testis. Typically, laboratory tests such as complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis are within normal ranges, although an ultrasound of the testicular tissue may reveal a mass. In these cases, your veterinarian may recommend performing a tissue biopsy of the testicular mass for further evaluation. If this is not possible, castration may be required to confirm the diagnosis.
 


Treatment

Removal of the tumor is the treatment of choice, which is best accomplished by castrating the cat. If the tumor is cancerous or has metastasized to other parts of the body, however, your veterinarian may recommend chemotherapy.

Living and Management

In general, the overall prognosis of cats that undergo castration is excellent. But this is dependent on the whether the tumor is benign or malignant."," and Types

73,Testicular Tumor (Leydig Cell) in Cats,"Tumor of the Interstitial Cell of the Testicle in Cats

The Leydig cell tumor (LCT) is a rare and typically benign tumor that affects older male animals. These tumors are located in the testis and are made up from the cells that release the testosterone hormone into the connective tissue of the testicles. This type of tumor may occur singularly, or in multiples, measuring about 1-2 cm in diameter and spherical in shape. LCTs can be felt as a mass, causing soft swelling of the affected testis.   It is classified as a sex-cord stromal tumor, meaning that the tumor issues from the connective tissues of the sex-cords of the testis. This disease is relatively rare in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    One 	or more round masses (1-2 cm in diameter) in a testicle
    There 	are generally no symptoms with this type of tumor, unless it is 	actually a Sertoli cell tumor (cells which help nourish spermatids 	as they transform into spermatozoa in the testicles)
    Signs 	of a Sertoli cell tumor:
    
        Feminization 		(from secretion of estrogen)
        Bone 		marrow underdevelopment
    
    


Causes

The cause of LCT is unknown, but a retained testicle (usually in the abdomen) may predispose cats to Leydig cell tumor formation.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, palpating (examination by touch) your cat's testicles to examine the size, location, and consistency of the tumor. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health, with a description of symptoms, if any, and their time of onset. Usually a blood chemical profile, complete blood count, and urinalysis will return as normal, but there may be various reductions of cells in the circulating blood if there is an excess of estrogen. Blood serum should also be tested for estradiol, an estrogenic hormone, and testosterone concentrations. Usually estradiol levels will be high, while testosterone levels will be low. Your veterinarian may also take a fine needle sample of fluid (aspirate) from the tumor to check for abnormalities in the cells, by use of a cytological (microscopic) examination

Tumors smaller than 3 cm in diameter will appear black on ultrasound imaging.  However, tumors greater than 5 cm have a black and white blotched appearance on ultrasound.



Treatment

Affected cats should be neutered, and the tumor(s) removed and sent for histopathologic analysis – examination of the diseased tissue.  If your cat shows signs of bone marrow underdevelopment, your veterinarian may prescribe medical therapy to reverse it.

Living and Management

Infection after surgery is always a cause for concern, and care must be taken to keep the surrounding area clean. You will need to observe any post-operative surgical incisions for swelling, redness or oozing. Infections can get complicated quickly. If any of these conditions are present, or if you have any questions, contact your veterinarian for further advisement.

If you are concerned about your ability to prevent your cat from getting its surgical site dirty, cage rest can be used to hold your cat in an enclosed environment until the sutured skin has healed adequately. An Elizabethan collar can also be used to prevent your cat from licking or biting at the healing skin – which may itch as it heals."," and Types

74,Testicular Swelling in Cats,"Epididymitis/Orchitis in Cats

Orchitis is inflammation of the testes, while epididymitis is inflammation of the testicular tube where sperm is stored. While the condition can be chronic, acute forms caused by direct trauma to the scrotum are most common. This condition is rare, but not unheard of in cats.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms of epididymitis and orchitis can be localized in the area of the scrotum. These include:


    Swollen testicles
    Licking of the scrotum and scrotal 	skin irritation (dermatitis)
    Non-localized symptoms include 	pain and fever
    Unwillingness to walk and general 	lethargy
    Open wound
    Refusal to eat
    In addition, infertility may be diagnosed in animals with this  condition


Causes

Acute forms of the condition are most often caused by trauma to the scrotum. Epididymitis and orchitis can also be triggered by infectious organisms, as well as by other conditions, including viral causes (i.e., distemper), infections associated with inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis). Bite wounds on any area of the body can also lead to epididymitis or orchitis.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Other potential causes of the above mentioned symptoms must be ruled out before your veterinarian can make a definitive diagnosis. The method of differential diagnosis may be used to eliminate the most likely underlying issues that would lead to this reproductive disorder. Some of the conditions include hernia of the scrotum, scrotal dermatitis, twisting of the spermatic cord, sperm-filled mass of inflamed tissue (granuloma), fluid-filled sacks on the spermatic cord (hydrocele), prostatitis, cystitis, and abnormal cell growth (neoplasia).

White blood cell counts may be high in cases of infectious orchitis. If the root cause is prostatitis or cystitis, a urinalysis is likely to reveal blood, pus, or excess proteins. Antibody testing should determine if an infectious organism is at the root of the problem. Ultrasounds of the prostate, testes, and epididymis may also be performed to rule out other causes.

If an open wound is present, it should be checked for bacterial infection. A bacterial culture may also be taken of the prostate, as well as of the fluid in the testes. Semen should also be collected and tested.


Treatment and Care

Treatment depends on whether or not your cat is used for breeding. If it is, and the problem only affects one side (unilateral), partial castration may be an option. However, if the condition affects both sides, or if your cat  is not utilized for breeding, full castration is generally performed.

Your cat should be treated with antibiotics for at least three weeks, however, antibiotic treatment alone will not always lead to improvement.

Living and Management

The condition itself, or castration (even if unilateral), can result in permanent infertility. Your cat's semen should be checked for viability again at three months after treatment.

Prevention

Prompt treatment of wounds, and prevention of infections are the best weapons against epididymitis and orchitis. It is also best to keep your cat in good health, and to uphold a regular visitation schedule with your veterinarian."," and Types

75,Temporomandibular Joint Disorders in Cats,"The temporomandibular joint is the hinged point in the jaw that is formed by the temporal and mandible bones, collectively known as the jaw joint.  The temporomandibular joint is also frequently referred to simply as TMJ.

There are two temporomandibular joints, one on each side of the face, each one working in concert with the other. TMJ plays a pivotal role in the normal chewing process, and is in fact essential for proper chewing, so that and any disorder of this joint compromises the ability to make normal mouth movements and chew food. An affected animal will feel pain when closing or opening the mouth, or both. Diseases and disorders of the TMJ are referred to as temporomandibular joint disorders.

Symptoms and Types
 

    Difficulty opening/closing the mouth
    Mandible bone may be out of place and visible form the side of the face (deviation of the mandible bone)
    Pain when chewing food
    Vocalizing, mewing while trying to eat
    Loss of appetite


Causes


    Injury or trauma causing fractures to the joints
    Stress in joint after carrying heavy objects by mouth (might be objects or kittens)


Diagnosis
 
Most affected cats are presented to their veterinarian with the complaint that they are unable to eat normally. You will need to begin by giving a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, when the problems first appeared, and whether there have been any previous traumas or injuries involving the mouth or head.

After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog, examining the mouth, bones and the joints in the mouth. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.  The results of these tests are often found to be normal, especially if no other concurrent disease is present.



X-rays remain a valuable tool in the diagnosis of TMJ disorders, and your doctor will be likely to use this type of imaging to get a better view of the bones and joints in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as well, and can give a better, more detailed view that standard X-ray. If your veterinarian has an MRI machine in the clinic, this may be the recommended image technique. If something more severe is suspected, such as infection or tumor, your veterinarian may also take a small sample from the muscle tissue of the jaw so that other diseases that can cause similar symptoms can either be confirmed or ruled out.

Treatment

Treatment for TMJ disorders is two-fold and is aimed at eliminating or altering the underlying cause as well as treating the symptoms. In case of complete dislocation of the TMJ, your veterinarian will try to repair it by placing an object at a specific site close to the joint, and gently closing the mouth with a push in order to reduce the dislocation. If this method does not work well or the problem becomes chronic, surgery may be required to correct the defect. Pain killers will also be given to reduce the pain related these disorders. Muscle relaxing drugs may also be prescribed, if need be, to reduce the muscle tension created as a result of the TMJ disorder.

Living and Management

This condition can be very painful, and regular pain relieving drugs may be required until the symptoms have resolved completely. Your veterinarian may also use a feeding tube to give your cat its required nutrients, especially if your cat is unable to take adequate amounts of food through its mouth alone. Your veterinarian will also brief you on the correct use of the feeding tube at home and the best ways to prepare the food so that you can take your cat home to recover in relative comfort and quiet.

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself more than necessary. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication."," and Types

76,Teeth Misalignment in Cats,"Malocclusion of Teeth in Cats



Normally, a kitten will have 26 baby teeth once it is six months old. By the time it reaches adulthood, an adult cat will have 30 teeth. Misalignment of a cat's teeth, or malocclusion, occurs when the bite does not fit accordingly. That is, the top and bottom jaws do not fit together neatly. This may begin as the kitten's baby teeth come in and usually worsens as their adult teeth follow.



The smaller front teeth between the canines on the upper and lower jaws are called incisors. These are used to grasp food and to keep the tongue inside the mouth. Canines (also known as cuspids or fangs) are found behind the front teeth, which are also used to grasp. Behind the canines are the premolars (or bicuspids) and their function is to shear or cut food. Molars are the last teeth and are found at the back of the mouth; they are used for chewing.



Symptoms and Types of Malocclusion of Teeth



Common problems that can arise from tooth malocclusion:




	Mouth injuries
	Periodontal disease
	Soft-tissue defects from tooth contact in the floor of the mouth and the roof of the mouth (palate)
	Wear on the teeth
	Fractures




If problems with the palate persist, a fistula may result and become infected. In cases of misaligned teeth, the cat may have difficulty chewing, picking up food, and may be inclined to eat only larger pieces. They are also prone to tartar and plaque build-up.



There are several types of diagnosable malocclusion:




	Overbite (sometimes called overshot, Class 2, overjet, or mandibular brachygnathism)
	Underbite (also called undershot, reverse scissor bite, prognathism, and Class 3)
	Level bite (sometimes called even bite)
	Open bite (front teeth don’t meet each other when mouth is closed)
	Anterior crossbite (canine and premolars occlude normally but one or more lower incisors are in front of the upper incisors)
	Posterior crossbite (one or more premolar teeth overlap the upper teeth)
	Wry mouth or bite (one side of jaw grows longer than the other)
	Base narrow canines (lower teeth protrude inward and can harm the upper palate)




With an overbite, the upper jaw is longer than the lower one. When the mouth is closed, a gap between the upper and lower incisors occurs. Kittens born with an overbite will sometimes have the problem correct itself if the gap is not too large. However, a cat's bite will usually set at ten months old. At this time improvement will not happen on its own. Your pet's overbite may worsen as the permanent teeth come in because they are larger and can damage the soft parts of the mouth. Teeth extractions are sometimes necessary.



Causes of Malocclusion of Teeth



Malocclusions may be caused by:




	A congenital or hereditary predilection
	Failure of deciduous (baby) or permanent (adult) teeth to erupt properly
	Trauma to the mouth
	Retained baby teeth or delayed loss of baby teeth








Treatment for Malocclusion of Teeth



Most bite malocclusions do not require treatment, but in some cases, extractions may be necessary. It’s a good idea to brush the teeth regularly to prevent abnormal build-up of tartar and plaque. Your veterinarian will recommend a dental specialist if you want to correct the teeth misalignment. In recent years, “braces” have been made for kittens to realign the teeth before they can become a health issue."," and Types of Malocclusion of Teeth

77,Tear in the Heart in Cats,"Atrial Wall Tear in Cats

A cat’s heart can be divided into four chambers. The upper chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium), and the lower chambers are called the ventricles. An atrial wall tear involves a rupturing of the atrium wall, which occurs mainly in response to blunt trauma. As with other wounds, the protective mechanisms of the body take over and heal the tear, with resulting scar formation, but if the tear is significant, the injury can lead to sudden death, or at the least cause serious illness. Trauma of this type can occur in cats of any breed, age, size, or gender.

Symptoms and Types


    Sudden weakness
    Fainting
    Sudden death
    Rapid heart rate
    Ascites (abnormal collection of fluid in the abdomen)
    Difficult breathing


Causes


    Blunt trauma to the thoracic cavity (chest)
    Neoplasm in the heart
    Other cardiac diseases may play some role


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Standard test will be performed, including complete blood tests, a biochemical profile, and a urinalysis. However, these tests may not reveal much information for the diagnosis of this disease. For confirmation of an injury to the atrial wall, your veterinarian will use specific diagnostic procedures and tests. X-rays, ECGs, echocardiography, color Doppler studies, and other such techniques will reveal structural and functional abnormalities pertaining to the heart. Any defect in the atrial wall, or scar formation indicating a past injury may be visible using some of these techniques.

  

Treatment

Treatment will be directed toward overcoming any complications resulting from the atrial tear. If scar tissue has formed at the site of the tear, your cat may stabilize but chances for future complications may continue. Surgery to correct the defect may be advised for some patients, but the outcome is usually not rewarding. Strict cage rest will be advised in such patients to encourage healing and avoid further complications.

Living and Management

Unfortunately, the chances for long-term survival are very low in these patients even if the tear has sealed through scar formation. However, your cat may show significant improvement and may only need to be checked by your attending veterinarian on a regular basis for progress evaluations. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines regarding cage rest, diet, and other management issues."," and Types

78,Taurine Deficiency in Cats,"What Is Taurine Deficiency in Cats?
Taurine is an essential nutrient (an amino acid, the building block of proteins) in cats. This amino acid can’t be made in their body because cats don’t have the enzymes needed. As a result, cats require taurine daily as part of their diet.

Taurine is found in most animal proteins like meat, liver, and eggs, and is easily obtained from naturally occurring prey such as fish, birds, and rodents.

Since 1987, taurine has been adequately provided in commercially prepared cat foods approved by the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Fortunately, as a result, taurine deficiency is not as common as it used to be.

Taurine has a wide range of essential functions throughout a cat’s body. It’s important for a cat’s heart, brain, and reproductive health. It’s necessary for vision and bile acid production, which aids in food digestion. When a cat is deficient in taurine—which often occurs only after months of eating inadequate levels—symptoms show up in these body systems.

Acutely, it is not considered a medical emergency, but over time, permanent damage can occur, resulting in blindness and even heart failure. Therefore, it’s important that as a pet parent, you ensure your cat is eating enough taurine in their food on a daily basis.

Symptoms of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Symptoms usually develop only after months of not eating enough taurine, but typically include the following:


	
	Eye damage with lesions that can lead to blindness—You may first notice your cat bumping into objects, seeming disoriented, having difficulty finding food/water bowls and toys, and showing reluctance to enter dark rooms or go up and down stairs. You may even see a greater sheen (reflectiveness) in their eyes.
	
	
	Impaired reproduction—This may result in spontaneous abortion, infertility, low birth weights, and birth defects. Affected kittens may have stunted growth and development.
	
	
	Heart dysfunction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)—This can lead to eventual heart failure. Pet parents may see their cat having difficulty breathing, pale or blue gums, a weak pulse, generalized weakness, collapse, and even death.
	
	
	Deafness
	
	
	Immune deficiency, which may show as recurrent infections
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Exercise intolerance
	
	
	Muscle atrophy
	


Causes of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Taurine deficiency in cats is often the result of an inadequate diet without enough taurine. Such examples include:


	
	Unfortified commercial diets
	
	
	Home-cooked diets
	
	
	Vegetarian diets
	
	
	Dog food fed to cats
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Diagnosis is often based on symptoms that are present and checking taurine levels of the blood. Feed can often be analyzed to determine if the taurine levels are high enough.

If vision problems are present, eye tests may be done, such as an electroretinogram (ERG), which can detect changes in retinal function. Cats with symptoms of heart disease will be screened for DCM through X-rays and echocardiography, where an ultrasound probe is used to look inside the heart.

Routine laboratory tests such as a complete blood cell count, internal organ function screening, urine testing, and testing for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may also be done.

Treatment of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Treatment of taurine deficiency in cats requires supplementation with taurine, which may be lifelong but is typically only needed for a few months until improvement is noted in the cat’s symptoms.

The diet is often changed as well to ensure the cat is fed a complete and well-balanced diet, one approved by AAFCO, the organizational body that ensures the safety and quality of pet food and requires the correct levels of taurine in the feed. Your veterinarian can recommend a high-quality taurine supplement, but be advised that the quality of supplements can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Formula® V Taurine Tablets and Dyna-Taurine® liquid are labeled for use in cats.

When looking for the best kind of diet to feed your cat, consider that the commercial pet food minimum taurine requirement for adult cats is 25 mg/100 kcal for dry food and 50 mg/100 kcal for canned foods.

It’s important to note, however, that the requirements can vary individually, so be sure to speak with your veterinarian about the right amounts of supplementation for your cat.

Cats with heart disease, especially those in heart failure, will often be placed on medications, most of which will be for life.

There is no treatment for cats diagnosed with retinal damage and/or blindness, as these symptoms can’t be healed. However, supplementation is advised to prevent further damage from occurring.

Recovery and Management of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
The prognosis for cats suffering with a deficiency in taurine varies and ultimately depends on the symptoms the cat has. With supplementation, cats diagnosed with DCM have a good prognosis and can show improvement in as little as a few weeks and can go on to have a good quality of life.

Cats suffering with retinal lesions will have permanent damage, as will cats with congenital birth defects. Yet most cats can adapt to being blind and learn to rely on their other senses. At home, you can take certain steps to ensure a safe environment, such as:


	
	Minimize moving furniture
	
	
	Block off access to stairs and pools.
	
	
	Keep the floor free from clutter
	
	
	Keep your cat indoors
	
	
	Apply padding to sharp edges and corners
	


Additionally, be sure to get your cat’s attention before approaching or petting her to prevent startling her. Voice commands can be useful when moving around the home.

Prevention of Taurine Deficiency in Cats
Fortunately, taurine deficiency is preventable. As cats require daily taurine supplementation and taurine is found in high quantities in animal protein, feed a diet with adequate sources of animal meat and byproducts, which the majority of AAFCO-approved diets contain.

Royal Canin®, Hill’s Science Diet®, and Purina One® all use highly digestible proteins and ensure all their products include taurine as part of their nutrient profiles.

Be sure to avoid feeding home-cooked diets, diets with excessive plant proteins, and commercially prepared dog food. These diets are often nutritionally unbalanced and don’t have enough taurine.
Taurine Deficiency in Cats FAQsWhat foods are high in taurine for cats?Most animal protein tissues such as muscle, heart, brain, and internal organs have high levels of taurine. Unfortunately, taurine is not found in plants.
How often do cats need taurine?Taurine is a daily requirement for cats that can easily be met by feeding a properly balanced, high-quality commercial cat food.
What are the side effects of taurine deficiency in cats?Taurine is important in heart, brain, and reproductive health and it is necessary for vision and bile acid production, which aids in food digestion. When taurine is deficient, heart disease, blindness, and spontaneous abortion can occur, among other symptoms.
Can cats have too much taurine?Taurine is considered to be well tolerated, and its toxicity potential is low. Excessive doses could cause gastrointestinal upset. Be sure to speak to your veterinarian about the right dose and brand of supplement to use.
How does a taurine deficiency in cats relate to cardiomyopathy?Taurine is thought to protect the heart by helping to regulate its ability to contract (pump) and save and make energy along with aiding in blood pressure regulation. Cats with deficient amounts of taurine can develop dilated cardiomyopathy, or DCM, which can lead to heart failure.

79,Tapeworms in Cats,"What Are Tapeworms in Cats?
If you let your cats go outside, there’s a good chance you’ll eventually have to deal with tapeworms. This is just one of the many reasons why it’s best to keep cats indoors.

While these common intestinal parasites aren’t very dangerous for cats, they’re certainly gross.

Tapeworms can get large—common varieties can grow to be over a foot long—and when they reproduce, they shed portions of their body (called proglottids or tapeworm segments), which you might see in your cat’s feces, the fur around their hind end, or their favorite resting spots.

Symptoms of Tapeworms in Cats
Proglottids are the egg-containing segments of a tapeworm’s body. When they first come out of your cat’s anus, they look like pieces of white rice, and they may wiggle for a while. Sometimes several tapeworm segments will be stuck together end-to-end. As they dry out, they become harder and more yellow than white.

Other than the presence of proglottids, most cats with tapeworms don’t have many other symptoms.

However, some possible symptoms of tapeworms in cats include:


	
	Scooting
	
	
	Licking at the hind end
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Vomiting
	


In rare cases, intestinal blockage and signs of systemic disease such as a poor appetite, low energy, and weight loss can occur.

Causes of Tapeworms in Cats
There are three main types of tapeworms in cats, each of which infect cats differently.


	
	The most common cat tapeworm is Dipylidium caninum. Cats get these tapeworms when they eat fleas containing immature forms of the parasite, usually when they are self-grooming in an attempt to rid themselves of fleas.
	
	
	Cats get Taenia (also called Hydatigera) tapeworms when they hunt and eat infected prey, usually rodents.
	
	
	Echinococcus tapeworms aren’t very common, but they can be transmitted to cats when they eat infected mice and squirrels.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Tapeworms in Cats
Veterinarians typically diagnose cats with tapeworms when they see proglottids around a cat’s hind end or in cat feces, or when a pet parent describes the proglottids they have seen at home.

Fecal flotation tests may reveal tapeworm eggs, but this is not as reliable as it is with other types of intestinal parasites like roundworms or hookworms.

Specialized testing that involves sending a fecal sample to a lab is often necessary if a veterinarian suspects that a cat may have echinococcus tapeworms.

Treatment of Tapeworms in Cats




Treating tapeworms in cats is fairly straightforward. Most veterinarians will recommend a medication called praziquantel. It's available in several forms.

By prescription:


	
	Compounded oral liquids that are made in flavors cats love
	
	
	Droncit™ tablets for cats
	
	
	Liquids that can be absorbed through the skin, like Profender™ and NexGard® Combo
	
	
	Injectable medications

Recovery and Management of Tapeworms in Cats
Most cats recover quickly after being treated for tapeworms.

Usually, the tapeworms will be broken down within a cat’s digestive tract, but if your cat has a lot of tapeworms, you may see some being expelled in their feces.

Side effects from tapeworm medications are rare. Call your veterinarian for advice if your cat acts sick in any way after being treated for tapeworms.

Keep in mind that while tapeworm medications are very good at getting rid of the tapeworms that a cat has at that time, they do nothing to prevent future infections.

Cats can get new tapeworms immediately after treatment, so prevention is vital.

Prevention of Tapeworms in Cats
Two forms of prevention are needed to stop cats from getting tapeworms:


	
	Effective flea control: Dipylidium caninum tapeworms are spread through fleas. Therefore, flea prevention is necessary to prevent these tapeworms.

	
		
		A good option for many cats is NexGard® Combo because it kills many types of cat parasites, including fleas, and also contains praziquantel as a backup measure for tapeworm prevention.
		
	
	
	
	Stop hunting: Cats get taenia and echinococcus tapeworms through hunting. Keeping cats indoors is the best way to prevent them from getting these types of tapeworms.
	


If your cat has recurring problems with tapeworms, your veterinarian may recommend regularly giving your cat praziquantel or another deworming medication as a preventive measure.
Tapeworms in Cats FAQsAre cat tapeworms contagious to humans?Some cat tapeworms are contagious to humans. People can get Dipylidium caninum tapeworms if they eat infected fleas that their cats may carry. People can also get taenia tapeworms, but eating undercooked pork is usually the culprit, not cats.

A rare type of tapeworm called echinococcus is contagious to humans and can cause serious disease or even be fatal. Thankfully, echinococcosis, as the disease is called, is rare and not commonly associated with cats.
How do indoor cats get tapeworms?Indoor cats can get tapeworms if they have fleas or hunt rodents within the house. Fleas can enter a home on other animals or even by temporarily hopping aboard people. They then have easy access to an indoor cat who isn’t being given a good flea preventive.
How do you treat tapeworms in cats at home?Several over-the-counter medications are available that treat tapeworms in cats. Both Drontal™ tablets and Elanco tapeworm dewormer for cats are safe and effective, but it’s always best to talk to your veterinarian before giving your cat any medication.

Proglottids are the egg-containing segments of a tapeworm’s body. When they first come out of your cat’s anus, they look like pieces of white rice, and they may wiggle for a while. Sometimes several tapeworm segments will be stuck together end-to-end. As they dry out, they become harder and more yellow than white.

Other than the presence of proglottids, most cats with tapeworms don’t have many other symptoms.

However, some possible symptoms of tapeworms in cats include:


	
	Scooting
	
	
	Licking at the hind end
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Vomiting
	


In rare cases, intestinal blockage and signs of systemic disease such as a poor appetite, low energy, and weight loss can occur.

80,Systemic Autoimmune Disease in Cats,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in Cats



Autoimmune diseases are the result of an immune system that has become hyper-defensive, attacking the cells, tissues, and organs of its own body as if they are diseases that need to be destroyed. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that is characterized by the formation of antibodies against a wide array of self-antigens (antibody-generating substances) and circulating immune complexes.



High levels of circulating antigen-antibody complexes (type III hypersensitivity) are formed and deposited in the glomerular basement membrane (the filtration portion of the kidney), the synovial membrane (the soft tissue that lines the surface space within joints such as the wrist, knee, etc.), and in the skin, blood vessels, and other sites in the body. Antibodies that are directed toward self-antigens that reside on and within cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets (three kinds of blood cells with type II hypersensitivity), may also be produced. To a lesser degree, type IV hypersensitivity may also be involved when cell-mediated immunity is directed against a self-antigen.



SLE is rare, but is believed to be underdiagnosed. Some of the breeds that appear to have a predilection for SLE include Persian, Siamese, and Himalayan cat breeds. The mean age is six years, but it can occur at any age. Gender does not play a role.



Symptoms and Types



Clinical symptoms depend on the localization of the immune complexes, along with the specificity of the autoantibodies. However, genetic, environmental, pharmacologic, and infectious factors may play a role in the appearance of clinical signs such as letahrgy, loss of appetite (anorexia), and fever, which is especially seen in the acute phase. Other signs include:



Musculoskeletal


	Deposition of immune complexes in the synovial membranes (the soft tissue lining the surfaces within the joints)
	Swollen and/or painful joints - major presenting sign in most patients
	Shifting-leg lameness
	Muscle pain or wasting




Skin/exocrine 


	Deposition of immune complexes in the skin
	Skin lesions
	Symmetric or focal skin lesions - redness, scaling, ulcers, depigmentation, and/or hair loss
	Ulceration of mucocutaneous junctions and oral mucosa may develop - a region of skin comprising both mucosa and cutaneous skin; these mostly occur near the orifices of the body at which the external skin stops and the mucosa that covers the inside of the body starts (e.g., mouth, anus, nostrils)




Renal/urologic 


	Deposition of immune complexes in the kidney
	Hepatosplenomegaly - enlargement of the kidney and the liver




Blood/lymph/immune system 


	Autoantibodies against erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets (red and white blood cells)
	Lymphadenopathy - swollen lymph nodes
	Other organ systems may be affected if there is deposition of immune complexes or antibodies, or when T cell-mediated cells (lymphocytes) attack




Causes



The definitive causes for SLE are unidentified, but exposure to ultraviolet light may exacerbate the disease.



Diagnosis



A complete blood profile will need to be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms, and whether the symptoms have occurred in succeeding order, or all at once. Pain in the joints, kidney inflammation, skin lesions, breakdown of red blood cells, low platelet count, and general body weakness are all signs that will alert your doctor to the likelihood of lupus.







Treatment



Hospitalization may be necessary for the initial management of SLE, especially if your cat is in a state of hemolytic (red blood cell destruction) crisis. However, outpatient management is often possible if the condition is not severe. The kind of care and the level of care will vary by which systems are being affected.



For at home treatment, you will need to enforce rest, especially during episodes of severe pain in the joints. You might consider cage rest for a short time, until your cat can safely move about again without overexertion. You may also need to avoid bright sunlight, which may require limiting your cat's access to bright windows until the late afternoon and evening hours. If the kidneys are being affected, your veterinarian will recommend a kidney specific protein-restricted diet.



There are a number of medications that can be used for treating SLE, such as immunosuppressive drugs for decreasing the immune system response, and corticosteroids for reducing inflammation in the lymph nodes. Your veterinarian will prescribe the medications required to treat the specific form the disease is taking in your cat.



Prevention



As SLE is known to be hereditary in some breeds, it is highly recommended that cats that have been diagnosed with SLE not be bred.



Living and Management



This is a progressive and unpredictable disease. Long-term, immunosuppressive therapy will be required. The treatments frequently have side effects that you will need to deal with as your dog's caretaker. Also, your veterinarian will want to see your cat weekly, at least initially, to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and to watch for severe side effects."," and Types

81,Synechiae in Cats,"Adhesions of the Iris of the Eye in Cats

Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye. They are the result of inflammation in the iris and are particularly common with anterior uveitis (inflammation of the dark tissues of the eye) and trauma to the eye.

Synechiae can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Synechiae may be anterior or posterior.


    Anterior synechiae is      defined as an adhesion between the iris and the cornea. The cornea is the      transparent cover of the front of the eye.
    Posterior synechiae is      the adherence of the iris to the capsule surrounding the lens of the eye.


Symptoms seen with synechiae include:


    Squinting
    Corneal lesions, such      as ulcers
    Excessive tearing
    Glaucoma
    Variation in the color      of the iris
    Opacity of the lens
    Uveitis
    Decreased papillary      reaction to light


Causes


    Cat fight injury
    Chronic infection
    Corneal ulcer
    Foreign body injury to      the eye
    Hyphema (bleeding in      the front part of the eye)
    Penetrating wounds to      the eye
    Surgery


Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. In addition, dyes may be used on the cornea to detect corneal injuries. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)



Treatment

In many cases, no treatment is necessary. If an underlying cause is diagnosed, it should be treated appropriately. In cases where glaucoma is present, laser surgery to repair the synechiae may be attempted."," and Types

82,Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats,"What Is Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats?
Cats have five major salivary glands. They are located on the face just behind the corners of the lips and extend from under the eye downward, close to the lower jaw. The salivary glands produce saliva and secrete it through small tubes called ducts into the mouth.

Salivary glands are an important part of a cat’s digestive system. When the salivary glands or their  ducts are damaged, a condition called a salivary mucocele (sialocele) forms. Saliva then leaks into  surrounding tissues, including the fat layer under the skin and under the gums.

Although any of the five salivary glands can be affected, those under the tongue and on the jawline are most commonly involved. A salivary mucocele is relatively uncommon in cats but if it does occur, it can cause significant problems.

If you notice any swelling on your cat’s face, neck, or under their tongue, have your cat examined by their veterinarian as soon as possible.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats
Clinical signs of a salivary mucocele vary, depending on which glands are affected and the extent of  damage. Often the first sign is a soft, nonpainful, slow-growing swelling on the neck, with or without excessive drooling. The swelling can be noticed on the side of the face as well, but often the saliva pools downward and the swelling is first noticed on the neck.

When the salivary glands under the tongue are affected, you may notice your cat is having trouble eating, chewing, or swallowing. Sometimes the swelling under the tongue is not noticed until your cat accidentally injures the area (usually when eating) and it begins to bleed.

When the salivary glands closer to the throat are damaged, this can be much more serious, causing difficulty breathing.

The least common salivary gland to be affected is under the eye, which can cause a swelling similar to that from an infected tooth root. A salivary mucocele is generally nonpainful, but the gland can become infected, causing pain and even a fever.

A tumor can also cause the swelling to be painful, and often it is harder in texture than a mucocele alone. You may notice your cat dropping food while eating, not eating as much, or not eating at all.  When cats get a mucocele on the neck or the lower jaw, there are often no signs other than the visible swelling.

Causes of Swelling of the Salivary Gland in Cats
A salivary mucocele can be caused by trauma, or also an inflammatory process that causes a blockage or rupture of the salivary gland capsule or the salivary ducts.

While the actual cause of the trauma is rarely identified, it is often from bite wounds or chewing on foreign material or objects. Accidental trauma from ear canal surgery can also cause a salivary mucocele, since the surgeon will be examining the areas around the salivary gland.

A salivary mucocele can also be caused by or can be confused with a tumor of the salivary glands, or the spread of a cancer from another part of the body to the salivary glands. Any disruption to the salivary glands or salivary ducts causes the saliva to leak out into the surrounding tissues, causing a significant, non-painful, slow-growing swelling.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Swelling of Salivary Gland in Cats
Salivary mucoceles are primarily diagnosed during a physical examination. Your cat’s veterinarian can differentiate a salivary mucocele from abscesses, tumors, and other types of cysts by using a needle to draw a sample of fluid from inside the mucocele. The condition can be identified by looking at the sample under a microscope. In some cases, the sample might need to be sent to a lab for analysis.

If the swelling is at the center of the neck, your veterinarian will lay your cat on its back to determine which side of the face the affected salivary gland is located. In some cases, your cat might have to be sedated, especially if the gland is under the tongue or in the back of the throat.

Treatment of Swelling of Salivary Gland in Cats
Surgical removal of the affected salivary gland is often the recommended treatment. If your cat’s mucocele is located under the tongue or on the neck, it can sometimes be managed by your veterinarian by periodically draining the area, but only if surgery is not an option due to a preexisting medical condition or other circumstances.

Draining a salivary mucocele with a needle is only a temporary solution and will likely cause it to become infected. Complete surgical removal of the gland and the duct is most important with salivary muscles in the throat, as without removal your cat may have trouble breathing.

For a salivary mucocele to be cured, the gland and all its ducts must be surgically removed. If the gland is infected, your veterinarian will start your cat on antibiotics. Pain medication might also be needed if the gland is infected, caused by a tumor, or after a surgical procedure. Anti-inflammatory medications are also considered.

Recovery and Management of Salivary Gland in Cats
If your cat is recovering from surgery for a salivary mucocele, it’s important to follow all of the veterinarian’s discharge instructions, including giving all medications as prescribed.

Sometimes a drain needs to be placed after surgery to continue to remove the fluid trapped in the tissues surrounding the area. This will have to be periodically reassessed by your vet and then removed once the drainage is complete.

It’s also important to have your cat wear an Elizabethan collar or cone to keep them from damaging the affected area or removing the drain. It may also be recommended that your cat only eat soft food to avoid damage to the surgery site.

For a salivary mucocele caused by trauma, as long as the gland is removed, your cat has an excellent chance for a full recovery and chances of reoccurrence are minimal. If the mucocele is only drained with a needle, it will come back in a matter of time, sometimes within hours to days. In general, salivary mucoceles in cats are extremely uncommon.

83,Swelling of the Optic Disk in the Retina of Cats,"Papilledema in Cats

Papilledema is a condition associated with the swelling of the optic disk located within the retina and leading to the cat's brain. This swelling can lead to increased pressure on the brain and may cause other symptoms, such as inflammation of the optic nerves.

When inflammation occurs it interferes with the eye's ability to transmit retinal information to the brain. Inflammation of the optic nerves may be related to inflammation on the brain or the retina, or could be solely related to the nerves. In some instances the optic nerve will only be partially inflamed, while in other instances the optic nerve will be inflamed along the full length of the retina.
 
Papilledema can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Depending on whether the nerves in both eyes have been affected, it may be difficult to observe symptoms. If both nerves are inflamed then signs of blindness will normally be present.
 
Symptoms will include bumping into things; getting lost within the normal habitat; a fearful attitude; and being incapable of catching toys or finding objects. Aggressive behavior may also be present. If the disease has affected the cat's brain, neurological indicators will be present. However, if the disease is systemic in nature, the cat may display signs of weakness, anorexia and lethargy.
 
Causes
 
There are a number of underlying causes associated with this disorder, including toxoplasmosis, which is caused by parasites. Other causes include fungal infection, water on the brain (hydrocephalus), tumors, peritonitis, inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the spinal cord and their membranes, or trauma due to injury.
 
Diagnosis
 
This condition can sometime be difficult to diagnose. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough examination of both eyes, including a check of the reflexes in the pupils and neurological nerves. Tests may also be ordered to look for fungal infections, or viral infections that are specific in nature, as well as scans to look at how well the brain is functioning.
 
 
 
Further testing will involve measuring the level of pressure on the cat's brain. If a systemic illness is present, the examination will include an overall physical checkup, to eliminate the presence of disease in other areas of your pet’s body. Chest X-rays may be ordered, as well as abdominal X-rays.
 
Treatment
 
In order for treatment to be effective, the cause of inflammation must first be identified.
 
Treatment for papilledema will involve monitoring your cat closely, along with the administration of medication to treat any underlying cause of inflammation associated with the optic nerves.
 
Optic neuritis, or swelling of the optic disk, is considered a very serious condition that could be life threatening, and as such, great care must be taken to help your cat maintain proper health.
 
Living and Management
 
It is important to follow your veterinarian’s medical instructions precisely in relation to the administration of medication. Follow-up visits to monitor your cat’s response to therapy, as well as any change in condition, is essential. Some animals will respond well to treatment and regain their sight, while others will not. Depending on the outcome, blindness may be permanent."," and Types

84,Swallowing Difficulties in Cats,"Dysphagia in Cats



There are a number of conditions that can cause a cat to have difficulty with swallowing. Dysphagia, the medical term given to this disorder, can occur anatomically as oral dysphagia (in the mouth), pharyngeal dysphagia (in the pharynx itself), or cricopharyngeal dysphagia (at the far end of the pharynx entering the esophagus).



Symptoms and Types



Oral dysphagia can be caused by dental disease, tongue paralysis, paralysis of the jaw, swelling or wasting away of the chewing muscles, or by an inability to open the mouth. Cats with oral dysphagia often eat in an altered way, such as tilting the head to one side or throwing the head backward while eating. Food packed in the cheek folds of the mouth without saliva are also typical signs of oral dysphagia.



Pharyngeal dysphagia is when the cat can grab food, but must repeatedly attempt to swallow while flexing and extending the head and neck, chewing excessively and gagging. While food is retained in the cheek folds of the mouth, it is saliva-coated. There is a diminished gag reflex and there may be snotty discharge from the nose.



With cricopharyngeal dysphagia, the cat may succeed at swallowing after several attempts, but afterward it gags, coughs and forcibly throws its food back up. Unlike pharyngeal dysphagia, the gag reflex is normal. Animals suffering from cricopharyngeal dysphagia are often very thin.



Causes



Anatomic/mechanical causes:


	Pharyngeal inflammation
	Due to abscess
	Inflammatory growths
	Tissue in the mouth filled with white cells and modified macrophages (the body cells that eat bacteria)
	Enlargement of the lymph nodes behind the pharynx
	Cancer
	Foreign body
	A pocket of saliva that is draining into the body
	Jaw joint disorders due to fracture or luxation (where the jaws slip out of joint)
	Lower jaw fracture
	Cleft palate – malformation in the roof of the mouth
	Lingual frenulum disorder – a small fold of tissue on the tongue
	Trauma/injury to the mouth




Dysphagia caused by pain:


	Dental disease(e.g., tooth fractures, abscess)
	Mandibular trauma
	Inflammation of the mouth
	Inflammation of the tongue
	Pharyngeal inflammation




Neuromuscular causes:


	Cranial nerve deficits
	Damage to trigeminal nerve (the nerve that stimulates the muscles for chewing)
	Paralyzed tongue – damage to the seventh nerve, the nerve that controls facial muscles
	Inflammation of the chewing muscles




Pharyngeal weakness or paralysis causes:


	Infectious polymyositis (e.g. Toxoplasmosis, Neosporosis)
	Immune-mediated polymyositis (hereditary muscle inflammation caused by an immune disease)
	Muscular dystrophy
	Polyneuropathies – problems with multiple nerves
	Myoneural junction disorders (when the nerves don’t receive the signal to trigger the muscles to act); i.e., Myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, botulism)




Neurological causes:


	Rabies
	Other brain disorders




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as recent illnesses or injuries. Your veterinarian will order standard tests, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood profile and a urinalysis. These tests will indicate if your pet has an infectious disease, kidney disease or a muscular injury. During the physical exam it is crucial that your veterinarian distinguish between vomiting and dysphagia. Vomiting involves abdominal contractions while dysphagia does not.



Your veterinarian may also draw blood to run laboratory tests for inflammatory disorders of the chewing muscles, like masticatory muscle myositis, as well as for myasthenia gravis, immune-mediated diseases, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism.



Your veterinarian will take X-ray and ultrasound images of your cat's skull and neck to inspect for any abnormalities. An ultrasound of the pharynx will help your veterinarian to visualize masses and help take tissue samples if needed. If your veterinarian suspects that your cat has a brain tumor, a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to locate the tumor and determine its severity.





Treatment



Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the dysphagia. If your cat's problems with eating are being caused by an abnormality of the mouth (oral dysphagia), you will need to feed your cat by placing a ball of food at the back of its throat and helping it to swallow. Patients suffering from pharyngeal or cricopharyngeal dysphagia may be helped to eat by lifting the head and neck during swallowing. If your cat cannot maintain a good body weight, your veterinarian may opt to insert a stomach tube. If a mass or foreign body is present due to your cat swallowing it, surgery may be necessary to remove it.



Living and Management



It is essential to keep your cat at a good body weight while it undergoes treatment. If your cat does not have a stomach tube placed and you are feeding it by hand, be sure to give it several small meals a day while it is sitting upright. You will need to support your cat in an upright position like this for 10 to 15 minutes after every meal to prevent aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when food is inhaled into the lungs.



Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia include depression, fever, pus-like nasal discharge, coughing, and/or problems breathing. If your cat should ever show any of these signs, call your veterinarian immediately and/or take your cat to an emergency veterinary clinic for immediate treatment."," and Types

85,Stupor and Coma in Cats,"Marginal Consciousness and Complete Unconsciousness in Cats

The term stupor is used if an animal is unconscious but can be aroused with very strong external stimulus, whereas  a patient that is in a coma will remain unconscious even if the same level of external stimulus is applied. Cats of any age, breed, or gender are susceptible to this condition.

Symptoms and Types
 
The symptoms are highly variable depending on the primary disease that has led to the loss of consciousness, whether it is temporary, as with stupor, or long lasting, as with coma.

The major symptom is varying levels of unconsciousness, with the degree of consciousness depending on the nature and severity of the underlying disease.

Causes


    Drugs which lead to loss of consciousness
    Abnormally low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia)
    Abnormally high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia)
    Abnormally high levels of sodium in the blood (hypernatremia)
    Abnormally low levels of sodium in the blood (hyponatremia)
    Low blood pressure
    Kidney failure
    Primary brain disease
    Trauma, especially to the head and brain
    Infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal)
    Unknown cause (idiopathic)
    Immune-mediated (immune system overreacts or attacks the body)
    Chemical or drug toxicity


Diagnosis

Both of these conditions are health emergencies and will require that you take your cat to a veterinarian immediately for treatment. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your cat. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. There are a number of diseases/conditions that can lead to these symptoms and laboratory tests will show any abnormalities that could be related to an underlying disease.

For example, in case of lead toxicity, abnormal red blood cells will usually appear in the complete blood count tests. In cases with infection and inflammation, an increased number of white blood cells, cells that multiply in response to infection and trauma, will be seen.

The biochemistry profile may indicate lower or higher than normal values of glucose in the blood, higher than normal levels of sodium in blood, and accumulation in the blood of nitrogenous waste products (urea), which are usually excreted out of the body through the urine.

The urinalysis may indicate high levels of glucose in the urine, a common sign in diabetes mellitus; abnormally high levels of proteins that are normally not present in the urine, such as with immune-mediated diseases; and abnormal crystals in the urine, such as what is seen in the presence of liver disease or ethylene glycol toxicity.

If the cause is not so readily apparent, more specific testing may be required to diagnose the underlying disease. Infections are one of the most important risk factors for developing stupor or coma, especially in case s of untreated infections. Your veterinarian will test for various infections that are common in cats and that are known to cause serious symptoms like stupor or coma.



Bleeding inside the brain is also a possible cause of stupor or coma, and your veterinarian can order tests to measure the normal blood clotting mechanisms in your cat's system. Besides laboratory analyses and tests, visual diagnostics can also be used to great advantage. X-rays of the abdomen and chest can be used to confirm if there is a diseased condition present in these  areas, or whether there have been resultant changes in the organs. Similarly, head X-rays can be used to evaluate whether an unknown injury has occurred, whether there is fracture, inflammation or any other injury that might be affecting the brain's ability to function normally.

Your doctor will need to determine which machine will give the clearest image of the head. In some cases, X-ray may not be enough, and a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be needed to diagnose the presence of  hemorrhage, fracture, mass, accumulation of fluid, or a penetrating foreign body in the skull and/or brain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may also be used to evaluate cardiac functions as cardiac diseases and abnormalities can also lead to stupor or coma.

Treatment

This is a health emergency and you will need to immediately take your cat to a  veterinary hospital. The major goal of emergency treatment is to save the life of the patient, and will be started as quickly as possible. Along with the emergency treatment, efforts will be made to diagnose the underlying cause in order to treat it. Oxygen supplementation is started as soon as the patient is received at the hospital in a condition of stupor or coma.

If there is excessive fluid loss, small amounts of intravenous fluids will be given to counter the fluid deficits. Large amount of fluids are usually avoided as this practice can cause further brain swelling in patients suffering from brain edema (swelling).

In case of head injuries, the cat's head will be kept elevated on a level above the rest of the body to avoid further swelling of the brain. If seizures are also a problem, medications will be given to control the seizures because these can also lead to further swelling of the brain. To overcome the brain swelling, drugs are given to promote urination in order to remove the fluid accumulated within brain. In serious head injuries or in cases with serious brain swelling, surgery is usually required to remove the fluid from the brain to reduce the swelling in order to save the life of the patient. In cases of infection, antibiotics can be given to control the symptoms related to the infection and to eliminate it from the body.

Living and Management

Stupor and coma are emergencies needing intensive hospital care and treatment. The overall prognosis largely depends on the treatment of the underlying disease or condition. Special attention needs to be paid to nutrition since these patients are not able to eat, especially during the time when they are partially or fully unconscious. Even after regaining consciousness, these patients need to be monitored closely for future episodes of similar symptoms.

At home, proper rest and isolation should be provided to your cat until it has fully recovered. You will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. To make the recovery period easier for your cat, place the feeding dishes and litter box close to where your cat is resting so that it does not need to make a lot of effort.  While you will want to give your cat as much peace as possible, you will need to check in on your cat frequently, observing its breathing pattern and rate.

Medications and nutrition need to be given on time, as scheduled. If your cat is too weak to eat a sufficient amount of food on its own, you will need to assist it in eating, either with a feeding syringe or tube. Your veterinarian will advise you on the method and how to go about doing it.

If you see any untoward symptoms, immediately consult your veterinarian."," and Types
 
The symptoms are highly variable depending on the primary disease that has led to the loss of consciousness, whether it is temporary, as with stupor, or long lasting, as with coma.

The major symptom is varying levels of unconsciousness, with the degree of consciousness depending on the nature and severity of the underlying disease.

86,Stud Tail in Cats,"Supracaudal Gland Hyperplasia in Cats



Stud tail is commonly seen in intact male cats but can also be seen in neutered males and females. It results in skin disease at the base of the tail.



Symptoms and Types




	Greasy (sometimes matted) hair at the base of the tail
	Missing hair at the base of the tail
	Blackheads (comedones) on the skin at the base of the tail
	Waxy substance on the skin and hair at the base of the tail
	Skin infection at the base of the tail
	A foul odor




Causes



The supracaudal gland at the base of the tail contains sebaceous glands that secrete an oily substance known as sebum. In stud tail, these glands secrete abnormal amounts of sebum. The condition is also known as supracaudal gland hyperplasia.



Stud tail is most often seen in intact male cats because male hormones encourage increased secretion of sebum. However, it is possible for female cats and neutered male cats to also suffer from the condition.



Diagnosis



Diagnosis is based on physical examination and the presence of typical symptoms at the base of the tail.







Treatment



Shampoos, particularly antiseborrheic shampoos, are used regularly to keep the area clean. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat infection, if present. Neutering may resolve symptoms of stud tail for intact male cats.

87,"Stretchy, Saggy, Painful Skin in Cats","Feline Cutaneous Asthenia in Cats

Feline cutaneous asthenia (FCA), also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, is a disease characterized by deficient levels of collagen, the protein molecule necessary for providing strength and elasticity to the skin and ligaments, along with much of the rest of the body. The condition is part of a group of hereditary disorders characterized by skin that is unusually stretchy and droopy. It is caused by a genetic mutation that is passed from parent to offspring, and while more than one genetic disorder is suspected, this condition cannot be determined by skin and tissue samples, it is diagnosed through observation.

Collagen is the “glue” that holds the body together, and a lack of collagen will result in abnormal collagen synthesis and fiber formation. Animals affected with this disorder suffer from painful dislocation at the joints due to the instability of the ligament fibers that hold the bones to each other. The ligaments normally stretch with movement, but without the elasticity needed to return to their original form they stay stretched out, allowing the bones to pop out of their connective joints.  This creates a painful physical environment for the sufferer of cutaneous asthenia. The lack of collagen also affects the structure of the skin. Without elasticity, the skin does not return to the body when it has been stretched away from the body, eventually drooping heavily. This slack also weakens the skin's resilience, making the skin easy to injure and prone to tearing, bruising and scarring. This disease is rare, and has been clearly identified in only a small number of cats. Animals are usually diagnosed at a young age.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of cutaneous asthenia generally include saggy skin, with redundant folds of skin. The skin is soft, delicate, and thin, with insufficient elasticity. The skin is easily torn, often leaving wide “fish mouth” type wounds that bleed very little, but that leave scars which widen over time. There may also be scars on the skin that are unaccounted for. Your cat may have swelling under the skin of the elbows, due to the bones putting pressure on the skin when the cat is at rest, and bruising and bleeding under the skin (hematoma) of the elbows, and throughout the body. Lacerations on the back and head are also common. Collagen is low internally as well as externally, making it possible for internal structures to rupture, with resultant internal bleeding.

For cats, symptoms will often show at about eight weeks of age. Normal play with litter mates will leave large tears in the skin, which heal quickly but leave lasting scars. Hernias have also been reported in cats affected with cutaneous asthenia.

This condition tends to affect the following breeds:


    Domestic 	shorthairs
    Domestic 	longhairs
    Himalayans


Causes

The primary cause of this medical condition is genetically based. It is caused by a genetic mutation that is passed from parent to offspring, and can be either dominant – from both parents, or recessive – from only one parent. In the dominant form, both parents are carriers of the mutated gene, with neither animal showing symptoms. With the recessive form, one parent may be a carrier, with no symptoms present. In either case, it is generally advised that the parents of an effected animal not be used for further breeding, and that the siblings of the affected animal also be prevented from breeding.



Diagnosis

An examination of the skin's extensibility is performed by stretching the skin to its full ability, observing any lack of discomfort in the animal, and measuring the extent the skin stretches to. The resulting  measurements are based on the Skin Extensibility Index (SEI), which measures the skin that has been stretched (using the dorsal skin on the back), divided by the length of the animal from the back crest of the skull to the base of the tail. The numerical value that is found determines the severity of the condition. The expected numbers are an index of higher than 19 percent for cats.

Treatment

This condition is incurable, and the prognosis for cutaneous asthenia is not good. Many pet owners choose to euthanize their pets in respect to the chronic pain the pet may be suffering, and the time spent treating chronic wounds. Households with other pets, or with children, make prospects of further injuries more relevant, since animals that are afflicted with this condition must be segregated from situations that can cause injury. Other animals can injure the affected animal, even through innocent play, and children may unintentionally pet the animal with too much vigor, causing the skin to tear. If you choose to keep your pet, it will have to be the only pet in the home, or completely isolated from other pets. You will need to keep its environment free of sharp corners and other hazards, and arrange sleeping and resting areas so that they are well padded. To prevent large skin tears, you must handle and restrain your cat carefully, and always inform visitors of your cat's condition so that accidental injuries are not an issue.

Cats should be declawed to prevent self injury, and any situation that might cause your cat to feel itchy should be avoided (e.g., insects, pollen, allergies from new foods). Needless to say, neutering is essential. This is not only to prevent passing the mutated gene, but because of injuries that can occur during mating. The inherent lack of collagen makes pregnancy impossible.

Living and Management

Lacerations, and even minor cuts to the skin should be repaired as they occur to avoid risk of infection. Antibiotics, both external and oral, should be kept in the home for treating your pet as needed. There has been some evidence that Vitamin C can be helpful for improving the skin, and is now typically recommended for owners who have decided to manage their cat's disease.  Checking with your veterinarian before administering anything to your cat's skin may be wise. Skin patch tests can be performed to make sure that your cat does not have an allergic reaction to the topical solutions you are considering."," and Types

88,Stomatitis in Cats,"What Is Stomatitis in Cats?
Stomatitis in cats is a complex, painful, and frustrating disease that causes severe inflammation of the entire mouth, including the gingiva (gum tissue around the teeth) and mucous membranes.

Feline stomatitis [often called feline chronic gingivo-stomatitis (FCGS) by veterinary dentists] affects up to 10% of cats.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Stomatitis in Cats
The first symptom of feline stomatitis you may notice is a foul odor coming from your cat’s mouth. This may be accompanied by excessive salivation/drooling, or you may notice that your cat is not grooming themselves as much.  

You might also see your cat dropping food from their mouth or crying out while eating. Some cats become so painful they become hesitant to eat and may avoid food to the point that they start losing weight.

Causes of Stomatitis in Cats
The cause of stomatitis in cats is unknown. Veterinarians do know that there is an abnormal immune system response that leads to stomatitis. It’s most likely an exaggerated response to bacteria and plaque on the teeth, but the exact cause of that response remains a mystery.

How Vets Diagnose Feline Stomatitis
Veterinarians diagnose stomatitis in cats primarily by doing a thorough oral examination.

Severe inflammation of the gums (gingiva) along with severe inflammation of the inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa) and the back of the mouth (caudal oropharynx) is usually diagnostic for stomatitis.

Many patients also experience tooth resorption and inflammation of the bone around the teeth (periodontitis) at the same time.

Treatment for Stomatitis in Cats
Successful treatment of feline stomatitis requires minimizing bacteria in the cat’s mouth as much as possible. This is rarely achieved through at-home dental care or anesthetized cleanings alone, as even a small amount of bacteria or plaque can be seen in cats with severe stomatitis.

In fact, cats with stomatitis often have severe inflammation that does not resolve or quickly returns after a thorough dental cleaning by their veterinarian. The current recommended treatment is partial or full-mouth tooth extraction surgery.

While this may seem to be a drastic measure, it is currently the best way to achieve substantial and long-term comfort for affected cats. This can be an extensive surgery, and your veterinarian may recommend a consultation with or referral to an American Veterinary Dental College specialist (aka, a veterinary dentist).

Recovery and Management of Feline Stomatitis
Studies have shown that 90% of cats that undergo partial or full-mouth tooth extractions have shown complete resolution of their symptoms. 

For cats that eat hard kibble, they should be transitioned to canned food before surgery with a plan to remain on a softened diet for at least two to three weeks after tooth extractions.

For cats that are hesitant to eat during the first few days after surgery, your veterinarian can prescribe an appetite stimulant. Your veterinarian will also provide medications for you to take home for post-surgical pain and inflammation.

Once the gum tissue has healed, many cats are willing and able to eat kibble again. And cat owners often see a quick improvement in their cat’s attitude, appetite, and quality of life once their mouth is free from the pain and inflammation of stomatitis.
Stomatitis in Cats FAQsIs stomatitis in cats curable?Feline stomatitis is curable in the sense that surgical removal of teeth and affected bone can lead to complete resolution of the pain and inflammation in the mouth, but there are no other medications or treatments that offer a true cure for this disease.
How long can a cat live with stomatitis?Cats affected by stomatitis can live with the disease for many years, but their quality of life can be severely affected. The relentless pain caused by stomatitis can cause a change in everything from your cat’s demeanor to an unwillingness to eat leading to drastic weight loss. Cats given the proper care for stomatitis through partial to full-mouth tooth extractions live the happier, healthier, pain-free lives they deserve.
What can I do if my cat has stomatitis?If your cat has been diagnosed with stomatitis, work with your veterinarian to develop a plan for when and how your cat can receive the necessary tooth extractions. As in humans, extensive dental surgery in pets can be expensive, so make sure your plan includes an estimate of costs so that you are prepared to budget accordingly.
Why do cats get stomatitis?Unfortunately, we do not know why cats get stomatitis. There is no current evidence that supports a specific cause. We only know that it is an abnormal response of the immune system.
Is stomatitis contagious in cats?No. Stomatitis is an abnormal over-response of the individual cat’s immune system and is, therefore, not contagious.

89,Stomach Worm Infection (Physalopterosis) in Cats,"Physalopterosis in Cats



Physalopterosis is caused by the organism Physaloptera spp., a parasite that can infect a cat's gastrointestinal tract. Typically, only a few worms are present; in fact, single worm infections are common.



There is no age, breed, or gender that is more susceptible to this infection than others. If you would like to learn more about how this disease can affect dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



An infection of stomach worms caused by Physaloptera spp. can be asymptomatic, meaning that no obvious outward symptoms are present, or the infection may be apparent by the presence of gastric symptoms. The primary symptom is vomiting, which can be of the chronic or acute form. In some cases, a worm, or multiple worms will be found in the contents of the vomit.



Causes



Stomach worms are caused by the parasitic organism Physaloptera spp. The worms are typically transmitted when an animal ingests the infective larvae that are residing in an intermediate host. Intermediate hosts, such as grubs, beetles, cockroaches, and crickets are commonly coprophagous -- meaning they eat feces, thereby propagating the life cycle of the Physaloptera parasite.



The worm can also be transmitted through ingestion of a transport host, such as a bird, rodent, frog, snake, or lizard. Outdoor exposure increases access to these intermediate or small vertebrate transport hosts, increasing the odds of contracting stomach worms. Indoor cats without access to these hosts are less susceptible to infection.



Diagnosis



The primary method for identifying and diagnosing worms is through endoscopic gastroscopy, in which a small thin tube with a tiny light and camera at the end is inserted through the cat's mouth and into the stomach in order to visually examine the interior of the stomach. Worms will usually attach to the stomach lining, or to the mucus-covered lining of the intestines.



A careful and thorough exam is necessary for detecting worms because there are generally not many present, and they can be hidden by mucus and stomach contents. Also, at 2.5 to 5 cm long, the worms are quite small.



An examination of the cat's vomit and feces may also reveal an infection of stomach worms if worm eggs are found to be present.







Treatment



Treatment of stomach worms can be done at home with prescribed drugs; the worms do not necessarily have to be removed. An adulticide designed to kill the adult worms can be prescribed, as well as other medications to reduce gastric symptoms.



Living and Management



Treatment with an adulticide, and any other prescribed medications, will need to be followed as per your veterinarian's instructions. Your doctor will schedule a follow-up visit for your cat, so that treatment efficacy can be assessed. Any clinical signs, or the shedding of eggs in feces, should be resolved within two weeks of treatment. If the initial treatment is unsuccessful, re-treatment may be necessary.



Prevention



Limiting your cat’s access to areas where intermediate hosts, or small rodent transport hosts can be found may prevent stomach worms. Outdoor exposure increases the odds of contracting stomach worms."," and Types

90,Stomach Infection with Helicobacter in Cats,"Helicobacter Infection in Cats  

The  Helicobacter bacteria are normal inhabitants of the intestinal tract, being found in several species, including domestic animals such as dogs, cats, ferrets and pigs, in wild animals such as cheetah's and monkeys, and in humans. Under normal conditions, the Helicobacter bacteria appear to be harmless to cats. While gastric infection due to Helicobacter pylori is a major health problem in humans – it has been associated with gastritis, gastric tumor, and peptic ulcer in affected people – the significance of this bacteria in cats and any correlation to gastric dysfunctions is still largely unclear.

Various species of Helicobacter organism have been isolated from the stomachs of cats and mixed infections can present, which sometimes complicates the diagnosis. Helicobacter pylori has been isolated in the stomachs of cats, and it is thought that humans may be susceptible to acquiring the bacteria from cats carrying it, or vice versa, but so far this is only an  assumption and the frequency of cats found carrying this form of Helicobacter is very low.  The most common forms of Helicobacter found in cats are Helicobacter felis and Helicobacter heilmannii. The bacteria inhabit the mucosal lining of the stomach, and the glandular cavities.

Infection from this bacteria is difficult to eradicate entirely and may last from months to years – even for a lifetime, in some cats.

Symptoms and Types


	In most cases no symptoms may be seen
	Vomiting
	Dehydration
	Poor appetite
	Abdominal pain
	Weight loss
	Weakness


Causes

Gastric Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter heilmannii, and rarely, Helicobacter pylori infection. The method by which this infection is transmitted remains unknown, but because of its higher prevalence in shelter cats, oral and/or fecal transmission is considered a possibility. This assumption is supported by the presence of Helicobacter-like organisms, called GHLOs, in the vomit, feces and saliva of animals that have been infected. There is also some suspicion that the bacteria may be transmitted by water, as GHLOs have been found in some surface waters.

Diagnosis

Establishing a definitive diagnosis of Helicobacter infection is difficult in most instances. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also take a sample from stomach wall and stain it with May-Grünwald-Giemsa, Gram, or Diff-Quik stains, which can easily demonstrate the presence of this organism by making it visible under microscope. 

 An endoscopic examination is of great help for direct observation of the stomach walls as well as for taking tissue samples for further processing. This procedure uses a device called an endoscope, a camera situated at the end of a flexible tube, which is threaded into the stomach through the esophagus. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is often used both to confirm the presence of Helicobacter in a given sample and to differentiate between the species of Helicobacters. However, confirmation can also be done by taking a tissue sample using the endoscope and observing the sample through microscope. 

Note that the presence of gastric Helicobacters in the body do not necessarily indicate an infection that needs to be treated.

Treatment 

As this disease is not fully described in animals, there is no single regimen accepted for treatment. If there are no apparent symptoms treatment is usually not conducted. On the contrary, in humans treatment is started if a Helicobacter infection is found, no matter whether clinical symptoms are present because such an infection can lead to stomach cancer in. However, this does not appear to be the case with cats, so further action is not taken unless the symptoms warrant it. If there is chronic vomiting or inflammation of the gastric lining, treatment will be directed toward easing those symptoms. Typically, fluid therapy will be carried out to compensate for fluid loss. 

Antibiotics, along with acid controlling drugs are the recommended course of treatment for cats found to be infected with a Helicobacter spp. Treatment generally consists of a two week course. Your will need to return to your veterinarian several weeks after the initial treatment for a follow up exam to verify whether the treatment was successful. In many cases, the infection or presence of bacteria returns, but it is not known if this is due to recrudescence (a renewal of the infection after a dormancy), or to reinfection from an outside source.

Living and Management 

Cats that are infected with the Helicobacter bacterium are more vulnerable to stomach upset, so it is suggested that their diet be changed to food that is easily digestible. In addition, if gastritis (inflammation of the gastric lining) is present, your veterinarian can instruct you in conducting an elimination diet so that you are able to avoid the foods that are most disruptive to your cat's digestive tract.

This disease is common where animals are kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions. If you keep many animals, be sure to provide them with enough space and a clean environment. Because this bacteria has been found to infect surface water, it is best to try to prevent your animals from drinking from streams, ponds, or rivers.

If you or your cat have been diagnosed with the Helicobacter pylori infection, talk to your veterinarian and your family doctor about the zoonotic potential of this organism and follow the guidelines given by your health care professional.

91,Stomach Disorder (Loss of Motility) in Cats,"Gastric Motility Disorders in Cats

Proper digestion depends on the spontaneous peristaltic (involuntary, wavelike) movements of the stomach muscles for moving food through the stomach and out into the duodenum -- the first portion of the small intestine.

Excessive gastric motility, with muscular contractions occurring too frequently, causes cramping pain and too rapid movement of food from the stomach; below normal motility causes delayed gastric emptying, abnormal gastric retention, gastric distention/bloating, and other related signs. Symptoms may occur at any age but it is less common in young cats than in aging cats.

Symptoms and Types

Clinical symptoms may vary depending on the primary cause responsible for gastric motility disorder. Following symptoms are commonly seen in affected cats:


    Chronic vomiting of food 	especially soon after taking meal
    Nausea
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Belching
    Compulsive eating of 	non-food substances (pica)
    Weight loss


Causes


    Idiopathic (cause unknown)
    Secondary to other metabolic 	disorders, such as:
    
        Hypokalemia
        Uremia
        Hepatic encephalopathy
        Hypothyroidism
    
    
    Secondary to primary gastric 	disease, such as:
    
        Gastritis
        Gastric ulcers
    
    
    After gastric surgery
    After use of certain drugs
    In case of excessive pain, fear, 	or trauma


  

Diagnosis

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis to look for the potential cause of the decreased or increased gastric motility. Dehydration, acid-base imbalances, and electrolyte imbalances are common in cases with chronic vomiting. An electrolyte profile will help in determining the extent of dehydration and other related abnormalities.

Abdominal X-rays will help in locating excess gas, fluid or food in the distended stomach. To improve visibility on X-ray and examine the movement of the stomach, barium sulfate can be used for contrast abdominal radiography. This method uses a medium, in this case barium sulfate, to bring the interior of the body into sharper focus by adding a substance to the organ or vessel that will be visible on X-ray imaging. The barium is mixed with meal and fed to the cat, and serial radiographs are then taken to determine the length of time it takes for gastric emptying.

Ultrasound is also a valuable diagnostic tool for stomach motility evaluation, and endoscopy is commonly employed for real time evaluation of the various abdominal organs, including stomach. An endoscope is a tubular device that is outfitted with a lighted camera and gathering tool. It is inserted into the body, generally by mouth, and threaded into the organ that is to be examined (e.g., bladder, stomach, etc.) so that your veterinarian can better view the internal structure of the stomach organ, discovering masses, tumors, abnormal cells, blockages, etc. The endoscope can also be used to collect a tissue sample for biopsy.

Treatment

Most cats do not require hospitalization for this condition; most likely, you will be able to return home with your pet after the initial treatment. In cases of severe bodily fluid loss (dehydration) or vomiting, your cat will need fluid therapy to restore fluid deficit and electrolyte imbalances. For proper management, a special diet may be advised for some patients with recurring gastric motility problems. Liquid or semi-liquid diets are often recommended to facilitate gastric emptying. Moreover, frequent small volume meals are preferred for affected cats.

In most uncomplicated cases, dietary manipulations alone are sufficient for successful resolution of the problem. However, in some cats, drugs to increase gastric motility may also be employed. Animals with gastric obstruction will require surgery for correction of the problem if it cannot be resolved by any other method.

Living and Management

In most cats with uncomplicated gastric motility problems, the initial treatment results in a successful resolution of the problem. If your cat does not respond to the initial therapy, a further diagnostic workup may be required. The length of the treatment will depend on the resolution of the underlying disorder. If surgery is performed, it may take 10 to 14 days to regain normal gastric motility and functions."," may occur at any age but it is less common in young cats than in aging cats.

Symptoms and Types

Clinical symptoms may vary depending on the primary cause responsible for gastric motility disorder. Following symptoms are commonly seen in affected cats:


    Chronic vomiting of food 	especially soon after taking meal
    Nausea
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Belching
    Compulsive eating of 	non-food substances (pica)

92,Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats,"What are Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats?
A stomach or intestinal ulcer develops when the normal protective lining in the stomach or duodenum—the upper part of the small intestine—is damaged. This causes underlying cells to be exposed to the stomach's acidic digestive fluids.

Stomach and intestinal ulcers can sometimes be referred to as gastroduodenal ulcers or gastric ulcers, classified by the location where the ulcers occur. The longer an ulcer goes untreated the deeper it can become, leading to bleeding, stomach/abdominal pain, and even a hole formed in the stomach or intestines, called a perforation. Fortunately, stomach ulcers are rare in cats.

Symptoms of Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats
Vomiting, with or without blood, is the most common clinical symptom of stomach and intestinal ulcers. When blood is present it may be bright red, dark brown, or black in color. Additional symptoms may include:


	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Abnormally dark stool (melena)

Causes of Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats
Stomach and intestinal ulcers in cats generally occur as part of another disease process, which either leads to the buildup of excessive stomach acid or breaks down the normal protective structures present in the stomach or intestines. The most common causes for stomach and intestinal ulcers in cats include:


	
	Parasites
	
	
	Cancer (for example, lymphoma, gastrinoma, carcinoma, mast cell tumor)
	
	
	Chronic or acute kidney failure
	
	
	Ibuprofen toxicity
	
	
	Severe stress
	
	
	Sepsis (severe body-wide infection)
	
	
	Foreign material in the stomach or intestines
	
	
	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (rare)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats
Diagnosis of a stomach or intestinal ulcer starts with your veterinarian obtaining a history of your cat's symptoms and performing a thorough physical examination. Other tests may include:


	Blood chemistry/complete blood count: A low red blood cell count is generally found in all cats with stomach ulcers regardless of cause. This test also measures electrolyte levels and internal organ function, which can help to determine if any systemic illnesses are present. White blood cell levels can help your veterinarian determine if a secondary infection has occurred.

	 
	Radiographs/x-rays: These can be helpful to look for an underlying cause like foreign material in the stomach or intestines or large masses. However, they cannot capture small details like the health of the stomach wall.

	 
	Ultrasound: An ultrasound of the abdomen/stomach can give more information on the wall and lining of the stomach.

	 
	Endoscopy: A camera-tipped tube is inserted from the throat. It is used to inspect the surface of the esophagus, stomach, and upper small intestine, to uncover the possible presence and extent of stomach or intestinal ulcers. If a cancerous cause is suspected, this procedure would allow for any visible mass to be sampled and sent to a laboratory for testing. This test requires anesthesia.


Treatment of Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats
Treatment for your cat depends on the cause, symptoms, and severity of a stomach ulcer.

Medical management of mild ulcers may include medications to decrease stomach acid production. There are two groups of this type of medication:


	H2 blockers, which decrease the amount of stomach acid present (ranitidine, cimetidine, famotidine)

	 
	Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which shut down the acid pumps to prevent stomach acid from getting pumped into the stomach (omeprazole).


In addition, medication to coat the lining of the stomach (sucralfate) may be prescribed.

Bacteria in the digestive system is normal and usually beneficial unless the protective layer of the stomach is damaged. However, bacteria can affect the exposed inner layers, so your veterinarian may prescribe an antibiotic to prevent or treat an infection.

In addition to the medications listed above, moderate to severe ulcers may require surgical intervention and even blood transfusions to treat anemia.

Recovery and Management of Stomach and Intestinal Ulcers in Cats
Depending on the severity of their ulcer and symptoms, cats may be treated at home with oral medications and should recover within a few days. Moderate to severe ulcers may require time in the hospital, especially if surgery is needed.

These patients are generally hospitalized for several days, and medications are generally recommended for at least two weeks. It is important to feed your cat an easily digestible diet. Prescription foods will likely be recommended for at least the recovery period, but a lifelong change in diet may be needed.

The prognosis for cats diagnosed with stomach ulcers depends on the cause, severity, and time to treatment. Pets with mild ulcers tend to do well. Severe ulcers can be life-threatening.

For cats at a high risk for the development of stomach ulcers, your veterinarian may recommend they stay on stomach acid-reducing medications or prescription diets long-term.

93,Stomach and Intestinal Inflammation in Cats,"Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis in Cats

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis in cats is an inflammatory condition of the stomach and intestines. The name of the disease is derived from the fact that lining of the stomach and intestines is infiltrated with a specific type of white blood cell known as an eosinophil.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

In cats, hypereosinophilic syndrome may involve not only the stomach and intestines but also the liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands and heart. Symptoms include:


    Vomiting
    Diarrhea – feces may be      bloody or dark in color
    Lack of appetite
    Weight loss


Causes


    Parasites
    Immune-mediated – may      be associated with food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease or with      adverse drug reactions
    Systemic mastocytosis      (a disorder involving mast cell infiltration of body tissues)
    Hypereosinophilic      syndrome
    Eosinophilic leukemia
    Eosinophilic granuloma
    Idiopathic eosinophilic      gastroenteritis (cause unknown)


Diagnosis

In order to confirm the diagnosis a veterinarian will typically examine your cat's feces for parasites. In many cases, deworming with a broad spectrum deworming product is used to help rule out parasites as well. Routine blood testing (including a complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urinalysis may also be performed to check for abnormalities in organ function and blood cells.

Imaging such as radiographs (X-rays) and abdominal ultrasonography may be used to examine the intestinal tract more thoroughly, while dietary trials may be performed to diagnose food allergies or hypersensitivities.

Definitive diagnosis is made by collecting samples of the stomach and intestines for biopsy via endoscopy or exploratory surgery. If your veterinarian suspects idiopathic eosinophilic gastroenteritis, diagnosis is attained by ruling out other causes.



Treatment

If an underlying cause is discovered, it is important that it be treated first. Parasites, for instance, are treated with an appropriate dewormer. Food allergies and hypersensitivities are controlled with an appropriate diet.

In cases where protein is lost from the intestines, special fluid products known as colloids may be required. Dehydration, meanwhile, must be corrected with fluid therapy.

Steroids such as prednisone or prednisolone are frequently used in treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis in cats. Other medications that may be necessary include anti-emetics to control vomiting and nausea."," and Types

94,Stomach and Intestinal Cancer (Leiomyosarcoma) in Cats,"Leiomyosarcoma of Stomach, Small and Large intestine in Cats

 

Leiomyosarcoma is an uncommon cancerous tumor, which, in this case, arises from the smooth muscles of the stomach and intestines. This extremely dangerous and painful disease affects mostly older cats (more than six years old), though all breeds are equally predisposed to leimyosarcoma. Moreover, the cancer has a tendency to metastasize to other sites in the gastrointestinal tract and other body organs.



Symptoms and Types

 

Most symptoms are related to gastrointestinal tract, including:

 


	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Weight loss
	Blood in stool (hematochezia)
	Gas (flatulence)
	Stomach growling, or rumbling sound (borborygmus)
	Feeling of incomplete defecation (fenesmus)


 

Causes

 

The exact cause for this cancer is currently unknown.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are usually within normal ranges. However, in some cats with advanced forms of the disease, few abnormalities, including anemia, abnormally highly number of white blood cells (leukocytosis), and abnormally low glucose levels (hypoglycemia) may be noted. Other diagnostic procedures include abdominal X-rays and ultrasounds, which help to identify changes in the stomach and intestinal walls, such as thickening of the wall. Contrast radiography, meanwhile, is used to enhance visualization of tissue and improve localization of the tumor.

 

Endoscopy is another valuable tool for direct visualization of the affected areas. This is performed with an endoscope, a rigid or flexible tube inserted into the esophagus down to the stomach and intestines. As well as visually inspecting the region, the veterinarian will remove a sample of the affected area (stomach and/or intestine) for biopsy to confirm diagnosis.



 

Treatment

 

Surgery remains the treatment of choice, which involves resection of the tumor mass along with some normal tissue. However, the extent of metastasis (such as in the liver) is a critical factor for final prognosis.

 

Living and Management

 

In cases of metastasis to other body organs, prognosis is very poor, where survival may only be a few months. Surgery may improve survival rates in some animals, but will require complete removal of the tumor mass. Following the surgery, you will have to take your cat for routine checkups, X-rays, and abdominal ultrasound every three months. Some cats may also require special, easily digestible diets, as well as painkillers to alleviate soreness. Strictly adhere to the veterinarian's guidelines watch for recurrence of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, and abdominal pain in the cat.

95,Stem Cell Disorders Due to Abnormal Development and Maturation in Cats,"Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Cats
 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders affecting the cat's hematopoietic stem cells, which forms the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These disorders are characterized by the abnormal development and maturation of hematopoietic stem cells, and may be primary (congenital) or secondary (due to cancer, drugs exposure, and/or infections).
 
Myelodysplastic syndromes more common in cats than dogs.
 
Symptoms and Types



    Weakness
    Lethargy
    Pale mucous membranes
    Weight loss
    Excessive bleeding
    Recurrent infections
    Enlargement of spleen and liver

 
Causes
 
Myelodysplastic syndromes is often associated with FeLV infections. Other risk factors include:
 

    Infections
    Bone marrow dysplasia
    Idiopathic neutropenia
    Drug toxicity (e.g., estrogen, cytotoxic anticancer agents, or trimethoprim and sulfa combination)

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cats’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing is especially important in making the diagnosis, as it may reveal abnormal reduction in the number of blood cells (cytopenia). In some cats, megaloblastic anemia is also seen. 
 
Other abnormal findings may include large, bizarre platelets and immature granulocytes (type of white blood cells) with abnormal shape and sizes. Your veterinarian will also take bone marrow sample to evaluate the red blood cell and white blood cells production process and identify abnormalities.

 


Treatment
 
Treatment is usually non-specific unless the underlying cause is identified. Often, cats suffering from myelodysplastic syndromes are prone to severe complications, such as infections, and require intensive nursing care. In these cases, these animal will undergo antibiotic therapy until their white blood cell count normalizes. These cats are also more susceptible to severe anemia and hemorrhages and will require multiple blood transfusions.
 
Living and Management 
 
Regular blood testing is required throughout treatment to evaluate the animal's progress. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis of these animals is not good, even after treatment. Maintaining the cat stable is, however, necessary to prevent further aggravation of symptoms."," and Types

96,Staph Infection in Cats,"Staphylococcal Infections in Cats



The Staphylococcus bacteria is one of the more commonly transmitted infections, passing easily from animal to animal and in some cases from animal to human. This bacteria can live free in the environment, on the skin of a host as a parasite, and in the upper respiratory tract of animals. This infection can be found in any breed of cat, and at any age.



Symptoms and Types



Some of the most common signs of this infection are:


	Fever
	Lack of appetite
	Pain
	Abscesses on the skin
	Infections of the eyes, skin, ears, eyes or respiratory system
	Itching (pruritus)
	Inflammation marked by pus filled lesions (pyoderma)




For cats, common indicators can include abscesses, oral infections, eye infections (conjunctivitis) and bacteremia (bacterial blood infection).



Causes



Younger cats are most prone to developing this infection, as their immune systems have not fully developed. Old animals are also more susceptible, as their immune systems have become compromised with age. Other causes can include bacterial or fungal infections (pathogens) of the blood, chronic debilitating diseases that wear down the immune system, allergies, and other secondary infections.



Diagnosis



A complete blood profile will be conducted by your veterinarian, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Proper diagnosis will often involve skin testing to determine if the condition is caused by allergies or other immune related causes. It is also important to rule out abnormal cell development as an underlying cause of the condition.





Treatment



A variety of medications are available to treat this medical condition, but some strains are resistant to medications. In some cases, standard antibiotics are not effective at curing this condition and a different course will need to be prescribed.



Living and Management



It is important to dispose of any potentially infected materials or contaminated objects. Also, external (topical) cleansing of the wound(s) and the infected area of skin is essential for healing the skin and preventing the bacteria from spreading. Because this type of bacteria is opportunistic, and can be passed to both animals and humans, special care must be taken when handling your cat and cleaning its wounds.



Prevention



There are not currently any known preventative measures for this infection.

97,"Stained, Discolored Teeth in Cats","Stained Tooth and Teeth in Cats

Any variation from normal tooth color is considered discoloration.  However, the normal color of teeth varies, dependent on the shade, thickness, and translucency of the enamel covering the tooth.

Symptoms and Types

Intrinsic discoloration is characterized by secondary factors that are happening inside the tooth, discoloring the underlying dentin. Extrinsic discoloration, meanwhile, occurs when exogenous pigment accumulates on the surface of teeth. That is, the cause of the discoloration is from an external source, rather than from a physical condition. Common symptoms associated with both discoloration types include:


    Abnormal 	coloration of one or more teeth
    Fractured 	tooth
    Pitted 	enamel (the glossy covering of the tooth) with staining
    Rings 	or lines of discoloration around one or more teeth


Causes

Intrinsic 	discoloration

    Internal 		(trauma, injury)
    External 		resorption (destruction) of the tooth
    Localized 		red blood cell destruction in the tooth (trauma)
    Systemic 		infections
    Medications 		(tetracycline)
    Exposure 		to too much fluorine (ingestion of toothpaste containing fluoride)
    High 		levels of bilirubin in the blood (from bile, the liquid in the 		gallbladder that helps to dissolve food in the intestines)
    Amelogenesis 		imperfecta (a condition in which dental enamel does not calcify 		enough)
    Dentinogenesis 		imperfecta (a condition in which the dentin does not develop 		correctly)


Extrinsic 	discoloration

    Bacterial 		stains from plaque (mucin, debris, bacteria and a thin film of 		food) and calculus
    Foods
    Bleeding 		gums
    Dental 		restorative materials
    Medications
    Metal


Diagnosis

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible conditions that might have caused this condition, such as diet, injury, recent illnesses, etc. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues to the origin of the dental condition.

An oral exam is part of a thorough physical exam. Your veterinarian will need to x-ray your cat's teeth in order to identify internal or external resorption, and whether restorative materials or bacterial stain from bacteria are entering the crown of the teeth. Your veterinarian may also use a strong fiber optic light that is focused on the teeth to determine vital from dead dental pulp (the nerves and blood vessels in the tooth). If the tooth (or teeth) need to be removed, your veterinarian will most likely need to subdue your cat with general anesthetize in order to extract it.




Treatment

Intrinsic stain removal may be done to improve the function of the teeth and to relieve pain for your dog. This often involves using endodontic treatment (endodontics treat the interior of the tooth, pulp and surrounding tissue of the teeth). Crowns and veneers may be used to protect the teeth and the pulp in the teeth.

Extrinsic stain removal can be performed for cosmetic reasons. These procedures often involve internal and/or external treatments such as bleaching, veneers, and crowns.

Living and Management

Any discolored teeth should be treated to prevent plaque and calculus buildup and to prevent further periodontal disease. Discolored teeth are more prone to fracture, which could result in tooth abscessation (formation of an abscess, usually in response to bacterial infection).

Discoloration may be prevented in future litters by avoiding giving certain medications to the pregnant bitch. With proper attention, discoloration of teeth can be prevented in puppies."," and Types

98,Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats,"What Are Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats?
Squamous cells are flat, sheet-like cells with an irregular shape that form on the outer layer of skin and line the body cavities and internal organs, including the mouth. Squamous cells are located throughout the entire body, including the nail beds.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that occurs when these cells rapidly and abnormally divide in the skin or tissue lining, forming singular tumors that often initially appear like small scabs or sores. However, as the disease progresses, tumors become ulcerative (painful breaks that occur in the skin’s surface) and highly invasive (spreading into the surrounding, healthy tissues). Multiple tumors at one time are possible.

These tumors can form anywhere but are commonly found on the face in light-pigmented cats, including the tips of the ears, eyelids, lips, and the flat portion of the nose, and can also be present within the mouth (oral squamous cell carcinoma). It is rare for SCC to occur in the internal organs.

This type of skin cancer invades locally over time, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed for the best long-term prognosis. SCC also has the potential to metastasize (spread to other areas of the body), including regional lymph nodes, if untreated for too long.

Symptoms of Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats
Clinical signs and symptoms of SCC depend on the location of the tumor and vary widely:


	Cutaneous (skin):

	
		Small scabs or sores, can be singular or multiple, and are found on the tips of the ears, eyelids, and lips
		Ulceration of the flat portion of the nose
		Associated itchiness, scratching, hair loss
	
	
	Oral (mouth):
	
		Foul odor from the mouth
		Red, inflamed gums
		Bloody discharge, excess drooling
		Weight loss
		Poor appetite
	
	


Causes of Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats
While the exact cause of SCC is not fully known, both genetics and environmental factors are suspected to play a role.

Like humans, sunlight exposure and UV light can damage DNA and cause abnormal replication and division in squamous cells in cats, particularly in those with light pigmentation. Trauma to the skin, especially due to burns, can also damage squamous cells.

Dental disease and the presence of inflammation within the mouth is thought to precipitate oral SCC. Chronic periodontal disease and stomatitis (inflammatory disease of the mouth) in cats can have an underlying viral cause, including calicivirus.

Cats are excellent groomers and, although not confirmed, exposure to certain environmental contaminants on the hair coat—such as cigarette smoke and chemicals in flea collars—have also been suspected in cases of oral SCC.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats
Early detection is vital in cats with SCC. Scheduling routine physical exams for your pet allows your veterinarian to discover skin tumors when they are small and more easily treatable.

If suspected, SCC can be diagnosed by a procedure called a fine needle aspiration (FNA). A sterile needle is inserted into the tumor and a sample of the cells is retrieved using a syringe. Your veterinarian, or a veterinary pathologist, will then examine the cells under a microscope, a procedure known as cytology.

In some cases, especially if the results of the FNA were unclear, your veterinarian may recommend a biopsy of the tumor. A sample tissue from the tumor, or the entire tumor, can be excised and submitted for histopathology review by a veterinary pathologist. This will help determine how invasive the tumor is and if adequate surgical margins were obtained. Adequate surgical margins means that no cancer cells were present on the outer edges of the tissue when surgically removed. This is the main goal when excising a tumor to prevent recurrence of growth.

Depending on the location of the tumor, your veterinarian may recommend additional diagnostics to determine the stage of the cancer, including an imaging study (i.e., X-rays, ultrasound) and lab work (i.e., bloodwork, urinalysis). In cases of oral SCC, skull and dental X-rays may be helpful in determining how invasive the tumor is, and in detecting any spread to other areas such as the neck and chest.

Treatment of Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats
The recommended treatment protocol for SCC will depend on the location of the tumor (or tumors) and the invasive progression of the disease.

The best treatment option for cutaneous SCC is surgical removal. The prognosis is favorable if the entirety of the tumor can be removed. Cryosurgery (the use of extreme cold to destroy diseased tissue) can be performed if the tumor is small.

SCC in other areas of the body, where surgery has a less favorable outcome, may require a more extensive treatment protocol that includes radiation therapy. Tumors present on the nose are commonly treated this way. This procedure will likely require a referral to a veterinary oncologist (cancer specialist).

Oral SCC can be treated with a combination of surgery and radiation. However, these tumors must be addressed in the early stages for the most successful outcomes and, even then, an overall poor prognosis is possible.

Recovery and Management of Squamous Cell Carcinomas in Cats
It is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions once your pet is discharged to return home. Your veterinarian will likely prescribe medications to help prevent negative side effects during recovery. Anti-nausea, appetite stimulants, and pain medications are common examples.

An E-collar (recovery cone) will likely be needed to prevent any self-trauma or injury to surgical sites during the post-operative healing process. It is also important to keep any surgical sites clean and dry and limit your pet’s activity for at least 10 to 14 days to prevent dehiscence (opening of the wound). If you have any concerns while your pet is recovering at home, promptly contact your veterinary clinic.

For a light-pigmented cat, it may be helpful to limit its time in the sun to prevent large amounts of UV exposure.

How Long Can a Cat Live with Squamous Cell Carcinoma?

If diagnosed in its early stages, most cats with cutaneous SCC will go on to live healthy, normal lives. Recurrence of cutaneous SCC can occur if poor or inadequate surgical margins are obtained.

Unfortunately, cats that develop SCC in other areas, such as the mouth, have a poor long-term prognosis. Typically, a one-year survival rate is less than 10%. Oral SCC tends to be diagnosed at a later stage in the disease process and is highly invasive.

Early detection is critical for the best long-term prognosis in your pet. If you notice any suspicious skin lesions on your pet’s face, or you’re concerned about any potential dental abnormalities (i.e., sore gums, bloody discharge, foul odor, etc.), please contact your veterinarian for an appointment as soon as possible.

99,Sprains and Strains in Cats,"What Is a Sprain and Strain In a Cat?
Sprains and strains are words often used interchangeably, but they are not the same type of traumatic event.

A sprain occurs in ligaments (a band of tissue that connects two bones together, such as the cruciate ligaments that hold the knee together) when they’ve been stretched or torn beyond limits.

A strain happens similarly but in tendons (a band of tissue that connects a muscle to bone, like those seen in the calf muscles attaching to the ankle­—i.e., Achilles tendon) or in muscles themselves. 

Both types of injuries are often referred to as “soft tissue” injuries, and these injuries are commonly seen in cats.

Sprains and strains can be classified by the following grades:


	
	Grade 1: mild sprain/strain—tearing of the ligament or muscle fibers
	
	
	Grade 2: moderate sprain/strain—more extensive damage, but ligament/tendon hasn’t been ruptured or torn in two
	
	
	Grade 3: severe sprain/strain—a rupture has occurred often requiring surgical repair
	


Types of Sprains and Strains in Cats

Sprains and strains can occur in any ligament, tendon, and muscle, but the most common occurrences are often seen in those associated with the limbs themselves, including:


	
	Cruciate ligaments­—those that hold the knee together
	
	
	Achilles tendon
	
	
	Carpal (wrist) joint—known as palmar carpal breakdown, often attributed to a hyperextension injury when cats “catch” themselves when jumping down

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Sprains and Strains in Cats
The most common symptoms found in cats with sprains and strains include limping on one or more of their limbs. Cats may refuse to bear weight on the limb, but it is important to note that they may still use it. Other symptoms may include:


	
	Pain—either from directly touching the limb or manipulating it, or other signs attributed to pain such as decreased appetite, reclusiveness, or aggression
	
	
	Swelling or heat on the limb
	
	
	Decreased range of motion in the joint
	
	
	Laxity or instability of the joint
	
	
	Vocalizing
	
	
	Bruising
	


Causes of Sprains and Strains in Cats
Most often, soft tissue injuries like sprains and strains occur when cats overexert themselves, either from jumping, running, or playing too rough. Traumatic injuries can also occur in cuts, fights, and falls. Overweight cats and cats with arthritis or other musculoskeletal problems such as patellar luxation are more at risk than others. Kittens are also more at risk because of their rambunctious behavior, and they are prone to developing more injuries than adult cats. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Sprains and Strains in Cats
A physical exam is the best method for diagnosing your cat’s source of discomfort. Palpating the limbs and putting them through range of motion exercises, feeling the joints and evaluating your cat walk (videos taken at home are more helpful than watching your cat walk in the clinic!) is usually enough to localize the source of discomfort and pain. 

X-rays of the limb, joint taps (where a sample of joint fluid is obtained for evaluation), or referral for an ultrasound, MRI, and CT are usually recommended to ensure that no fracture or dislocation is found. Keep in mind that x-rays alone won’t diagnose a soft tissue injury. Blood work is often recommended, especially if medications are going to be prescribed to verify that the kidneys and liver are healthy enough to metabolize the drugs. 

Treatment of Sprains and Strains in Cats
For most sprains and strains, medications such as NSAIDs (Onsior, meloxicam) or pain medications (gabapentin, tramadol, buprenorphine) are prescribed to treat the discomfort and pain, and they also help speed up the recovery process by easing inflammation. 

Cage rest and limited activity (most often by isolating the cat in a room such as a bathroom) while healing is extremely helpful to ensure that your cat recuperates and heals appropriately, and to make sure they don’t reinjure themselves. They can be gradually reintroduced to activity and exercise after several weeks of confinement. If your cat is an outdoor cat, be sure to keep her inside while she heals. 

Not all cases of sprains require medical intervention—just like in humans—so talk with your veterinarian to determine the best treatment plan for your cat. Do not give your cat any medication without authorization, because many human medications such as Tylenol are toxic to cats.  Non-medication alternatives to treat sprains include laser therapy, acupuncture, and physical therapy. In rare and severe cases, surgery may be required.  

Recovery and Management of Sprains and Strains in Cats
The good news is that for most sprains and strains, your cat should be back to normal in a matter of days or weeks. When pain medications and treatment begin, your cat will begin to feel better and can be more likely to reinjure herself by running or playing before the injury has fully healed. Ensuring that she is confined to a limited space for this time is paramount to a speedy recovery. Be sure to follow all your veterinarian’s recommendations, including finishing the course of medication prescribed. Should limping recur or persist past the timeframe of recovery, return to the vet for additional care and diagnostics, because something else may be the cause.

Prevention of Sprains and Strains in Cats

Kittens, more so than adults, are very curious and adventurous. And if your cat seems accident-prone, you may want to limit the amount of jumping and leaping she does at home.  Teaching her from a young age to use stairs instead of jumping, and keeping her off counters and other high places, can help prevent major injuries. Installing a “catio” or leash training your cat to go for walks can also limit the risks your cat takes.  
Sprains and Strains in Cats FAQSCan a sprain heal on its own?With time and a little bit of TLC, the good news is that most sprains will heal uneventfully. However, your cat may still be in pain during this process and may need some medication to help aid the recovery.
Can a cat walk on a sprained leg?Cats can most definitely walk on a sprained leg; however, you may notice a slight limp or favoring of the injured limb. If so, or if your cat has been diagnosed with a sprain, be sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations, which will include exercise restriction or cage rest.  Just because your cat can walk on the limb doesn’t mean she should.

The most common symptoms found in cats with sprains and strains include limping on one or more of their limbs. Cats may refuse to bear weight on the limb, but it is important to note that they may still use it. Other symptoms may include:


	
	Pain—either from directly touching the limb or manipulating it, or other signs attributed to pain such as decreased appetite, reclusiveness, or aggression
	
	
	Swelling or heat on the limb
	
	
	Decreased range of motion in the joint
	
	
	Laxity or instability of the joint
	
	
	Vocalizing
	
	
	Bruising

100,Spontaneous Abortion and Termination of Pregnancy in Cats,"Unintentional and unwanted pregnancy in pets is a common concern, and there are ways to perform a safe pregnancy termination if your cat has become pregnant. If you are considering ending a pregnancy in your cat, it is recommended that you first seek the advice and assistance of a medical professional, so that a full risk and side effects evaluation can be done.



Conversely, it is also important to note that cats can experience spontaneous abortions or miscarriages for a variety of medical reasons. Both situations will be covered here.



Symptoms and Types



If your cat has experienced a spontaneous abortion, the most common thing you may notice is abnormal vaginal bleeding; in some cases an expelled fetus may be found. The most common cause of a spontaneous abortion is fetal death due to a hormonal imbalance.



In the case of a planned abortion, bleeding is the most common symptom following the procedure. You will need to closely monitor your cat so that any side effects or health related issues can be responded to quickly.



Diagnosis 



If you suspect that your cat is pregnant, your veterinarian can perform an examination by ultrasound to confirm or rule it out. Confirmation of the presence of a fetus is usually necessary before many health care providers will agree to perform a medical abortion. Doppler-type instruments can also be used to hear a fetus' heartbeat if the pregnancy is far enough along.





Treatment 



For owners looking for safe options, either to prevent an unwanted pregnancy or to terminate a possible pregnancy, there are several medical alternatives to consider. To permanently prevent pregnancy in your cat, spaying (ovariohysterectomy) is the best option. For pregnancy termination, these are the most common medical options:



Injectable Estrogens- A medical professional can administer these to prevent a pregnancy from progressing. The estrogen must be injected shortly following copulation to be effective. However, there are several potential side effects to take into consideration, including bone marrow suppression and pyometra (i.e., infection of the uterus).



Oral Estrogens - These are not usually recommended because they are ineffective and may cause pyometra in animals.



Prostaglandin F2 alpha - This is a natural hormone that has been shown to induce a safe abortion for cats when monitored by a health professional. Most side effects are often mild, if present at all. Some of the drug's known side effects include panting, trembling, nausea and diarrhea.



Dexamethasone - This is also a viable option to induce an abortion for pets. The injection is usually followed by side effects, such as panting, excessive drinking (polydispia) and urination (polyuria).



Living and Management



It is important to note that despite the myths surrounding the method, post-coital douches do not effectively terminate an unwanted pregnancy in a cat.



Following either a planned or spontaneous abortion, there can be a great deal of discomfort and/or some vaginal bleeding or abnormal discharge. You will need to carefully observe the behavior of your cat to ensure that more serious problems do not develop as a result."," and Types

101,Spine Degeneration in Cats,"Spondylosis Deformans in Cats

Characterized by the production of bone spurs along the bottom, sides, and upper aspects of the vertebrae of the spine, spondylosis deformans is a degenerative, noninflammatory condition of the spinal column. The bone spurs are simply projected growths of bone, usually grown in response to aging, or injury. In cats, spondylosis deformans tends to occur more often in the vertebrae of the chest.

Symptoms and Types


    Patients are typically asymptomatic; bone growth can usually be felt by touch before you will notice any behavioral changes in your cat as a result of the growth
    Pain may follow fracture of bony spurs or bridges
    Stiffness
    Restricted motion
    Pain

 
Causes


    Repeated microtrauma – repetitive pressure on the same joints, or bones, as through certain exercises or other activities
    Major trauma – the body responds by attempting to grow new bone
    Inherited predisposition to spurs




Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel, in order to rule out or confirm other diseases, like cancer. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background health history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.

X-ray images of the chest and abdomen (side view) are essential for diagnosing spondylosis deformans.  X-rays will reveal osteophytes (small, bony growths) on the vertebrae, or in more advanced cases an osteophyte may be found as a bridge in the space between the vertebrae.

Your doctor may choose from several other types of tests in order to arrive at a definitive conclusion. A myelography, which uses injection of a radiopaque substance for internal imaging; computed tomography (CT); or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can assist your veterinarian in finding where a bony spur might be pressing on your cat's spinal cord or nerves (causing neurological reactions).
 
Treatment

Typically, patients with spondylosis deformans will not show outward symptoms of early abnormal bone growth. A neurologic exam should be performed to rule out a spinal condition requiring surgery. If the growth has reached the point of damaging the nerves, tissue, or otherwise, and your cat is in severe pain, or if your veterinarian has settled on a surgical remedy, your cat will be hospitalized. Under normal circumstances, where damage to the body is minimal, and your cat is feeling some discomfort and pain, it will be treated on an outpatient basis, with strict rest and pain medication prescribed for home treatment. Pain medications can be administered to your pet after its meals. Acupuncture may also provide pain relief for some animals.  

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up progress checks for your cat depending on the severity of the symptoms. Only give pain medications when your cat is showing signs of discomfort (and only after a meal), and only give the exact amount that was prescribed, unless your veterinarian indicates otherwise. Overdose of drugs/medications is one of the most common causes of unintentional deaths in pets. You will also need to provide a safe and quiet place for your cat to rest, away from other pets and active children. Only minimal activity will be necessary for your cat during this time. When your cat has not shown signs of discomfort for several weeks it may be slowly allowed to return to normal activity."," and Types

102,Spinal Malformation in the Neck of Cats,"Atlantoaxial Instability in Cats

Atlantoaxial instability results from a malformation in the first two vertebrae in the neck. This causes the spinal cord to compress and results in pain, or even debilitation. The disorder affects cats, but is generally found in smaller breeds and is uncommon in older cats. To ensure the best possible chance for a full recovery, it is important to have your cat treated once an occurrence or sign of distress is observed.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Cats suffering from atlantoaxial instability may collapse frequently or may suffer from paralysis, depending on the severity of the spinal cord injury. Many cats also exhibit severe neck and back pain and a lack of activity.
 
Causes
 
The most common cause of atlantoaxial instability is an abnormal formation of ligaments in the cat's vertebrae, often leading to fractures. The formation may also be the consequence of trauma due to an accident.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will look for signs of trauma, seizures, tumors (neoplasia), severe exercise intolerance, and disk herniation. An X-ray or radiograph of your cat's spine may be taken to see if there are any injuries to the neck or spine. In addition to radiographs, CAT scans (computed tomography) may be used to view the soft tissue structures in your cat’s neck and spine. If this disorder goes untreated, it often will lead to acute spinal cord trauma, respiratory arrest, and possibly even death.
 
  
 
Treatment
 
If your cat only experiences mild neck pain, a brace and confinement may be recommended. But, if your cat is experiencing neck pain along with other neurological symptoms, surgery is often the best course of action. The dorsal (top) approach involves the use of a wire or other synthetic material to fix the vertebral abnormalities. The ventral (underside) approach involves the use of a bone graft to repair the damage. The ventral approach is often considered the more stable approach in damage repair.
 
Living and Management
 
For the best chance of recovery, it is recommended that you have your cat treated as quickly as possible after the initial distress has been observed, and immediately after a trauma has occurred. If surgery is prescribed, younger cats will generally experience a full recovery when movement is restricted post-surgery. This is usually done with cage rest – keeping the cat in a cage, or enclosed space – so that the cat cannot overexert itself or re-injure itself. Physical rehabilitation following treatment is equally important for a full recovery, benefiting neurological functions as well.
 
Prevention
 
As most cases are present at birth (congenital), preventative measures are limited."," and Types

103,Spinal Cord Disorder Caused by Blocked Blood Vessel in Cats,"Fibrocartilaginous Embolic Myelopathy in Cats

Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy in cats is a condition in which an area of the spinal cord is not able to function properly and eventually atrophies as a result of a blockage, or emboli, in the blood vessels of the spinal cord. Though relatively rare in cats, the cause of this disorder is typically the result of an injury to the spine. Injury may be the result of jumping and landing in the wrong way, fighting, or any accident that leads to a spinal injury.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms appear suddenly and usually follow what appears to be a mild injury or vigorous exercise.


    Sudden, severe pain, cat may cry 	out at time of injury
    Pain may subside after few minutes 	to hours
    Paresis (signs of weakness or 	partial paralysis)
    Paralysis
    Lack of pain response
    Cat may stabilize within 12-24 	hours
    Wobbly, uncoordinated or drunken 	gait (ataxia)


Causes

The exact cause is still unknown, but it is thought that a seemingly minor injury to the spine can force intervertebral disc material into the spinal cord, causing an embolism, or blockage of blood flow through the spinal cord.

Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, and any injuries that you suspect to have recently occurred. Your veterinarian will rule out other causes, such as spinal tumor, intervertebral disc disease, or fracture before settling on a diagnosis. The above mentioned conditioned are very painful, therefore, a lack of pain can be indicative of an embolism in the spinal cord. Keep in mind that though there may be a lack of pain, the condition can be progressive and may affect long-term damage to the spine and neurological system. Immediate and supportive care is paramount.

Routine laboratory test results, such as urinalysis and complete blood counts, are usually unremarkable. A sample of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) may be taken for analysis, and a sample of blood from the veins and arteries of the spinal cord may show microscopic  fragments of fibrocartilage. Radiographic imaging studies may help in diagnosis. Apart from routine radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the best diagnostic technique for viewing the spinal cord. In the later stage of fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy, swelling may be present at the site of the blockage.

  

Treatment

Treatment will be directed according to your cat's condition, the severity of the symptoms, and the extent of damage to the spinal cord. Mild improvement may be seen in the first 14 days of treatment, with further improvement occurring between three to six weeks of treatment. From there on, recovery should progress until your cat is feeling up to speed again. Recovery from weakness is slow but gradual and will require patient, supportive care.

While your cat is recovering from this injury, it may have some troubles with incontinence, both urinary and fecal, or it may suffer from urinary tract infections. These symptoms should improve. However, if symptoms do not improve or if there is irreversible damage to the spinal cord, your  veterinarian may suggest that you consider euthanasia for your cat.

Living and Management

While your cat is in the recovery process, provide a calm and comfortable space for it to rest and heal, away from other pets and active children. If it is not practical to restrict your cat's movement, cage rest may be an option. Your cat will be feeling weak  in the first several weeks of recovery. To save your cat and yourself the frustration of accidents, you will want to place your cat's litter box near to where it is resting. Even if your cat normally spends time outdoors, you will need to  restrict your cat to the indoors until it has recovered.

Part of supportive care will include creating a resting area that is well padded, and making sure to turn your cat frequently to avoid bed sores.  Do not underestimate the healing capacity of affection. Stroking your cat so that it feels safe will relax its muscles and encourage its body to release the chemicals that are required for optimum healing. You may also want to hand feed your cat during this period of time, or at least make sure that the food is easily accessible.

Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up visit to monitor your cat's recovery and make changes to its diet or physical routine if necessary."," and Types

104,Spinal Cord Development Disorders in Cats,"Spinal Dysraphism in Cats
 
""Spinal Dysraphism"" is a broad term encompassing spinal cord developmental disorders leading to various structural defects. It may be progressive or non-progressive in nature.
 
Spinal Dysraphism has been reported in Manx cats and some breeds of dog.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Limb weakness
    Imbalance
    Neck or head pain
    Uncoordinated walk
    Postural abnormalities

 
Causes
 
Often, spinal dysraphism is due to spinal cord damage due to infection, trauma, or tumor(s).
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may be normal.
 
X-rays may reveal abnormalities related to vertebral column and spinal cord compression in some patients. However, without using sophisticated imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), the diagnosis is almost impossible in most cats.
 


Treatment
 
Those with mild symptoms may require little treatment, whereas more severe cases may require the use of special carts to assist mobility. Surgical intervention may also help in arresting the progression or improve the course by slowing the progression of neurological symptoms.
 
In case of urinary infections, antibiotics are used to control infections. Drugs, meanwhile, are used to reduce cerebrospinal fluid or CSF pressure in brain and spinal cord.
 
Living and Management
 
Maintaining the quality of life is important in cats suffering from spinal dysraphism. Other concerns include secondary urinary tract infections, which benefit from antibiotic therapy, and constant turning of cats that remain flat. This will help prevent ulcers and urine and fecal scalds.
 
If the cat shows little response to treatment, or in cases of advanced disease, your veterinarian may recommend euthanasia."," and Types

105,Spinal and Vertebral Birth Defects in Cats,"Congenital Spinal and Vertebral Malformations in Cats



Congenital spinal and vertebral malformations are most often genetically inherited (as opposed to adverse conditions during fetal development). Specifically, sacrococcygeal dysgenesis (defective development) is a dominant trait, while thoracic hemivertebra (chest half-vertebra) is a recessive trait.



Spinal malformations are usually evident at birth or in the first few weeks of life. On the other hand, vertebral malformations can be latent until the cat undergoes a growth spurt, sometimes not becoming apparent for several months. Visible signs of a distorted spinal column are lordosis (curvature of the spine at the lower back) and kyphosis (a posterior curvature of the spine).



Scoliosis (a lateral curvature of the spine) is also an easily visible form of vertebral malformation. If the malformations lead to secondary spinal cord compression and trauma, the affected cat will display ataxia and paresis. Medicine often does not resolve neurological manifestations of spinal and vertebral malformations. If the condition is severe and untreatable, euthanasia should be considered.

  

Symptoms and Types




	Malformation of the occipital bones – atlas and axis (the first and second cervical vertebrae at the base of the skull):
	
		Causes compression of the upper spinal cord, which can lead to paralysis, sudden death
	
	
	Hemivertebra (half a vertebra)
	
		Kyphosis, scoliosis, lordosis
		Wedge shaped vertebrae, causes angle in the spine
		Most likely to affect the neurological system
		Rear limb weakness (paraparesis), paralysis
	
	
	Transitional vertebra
	
		Has characteristics of two types of vertebrae
		May result in cord compression, disc changes
	
	
	Block vertebra
	
		Fused vertebrae due to improper segmentation of vertebrae
		Cat may live normally without symptoms
	
	
	Butterfly vertebra
	
		Vertebra with a cleft through the body and a funnel shape at the ends (giving appearance of butterfly on X-ray examination)
		Causes instability of the vertebral canal, and rarely, compression of the spinal cord with paralysis
		May remain without symptoms
	
	
	Spina bifida
	
		Lack of vertebral arches in the spinal column
		Accompanies sacrococcygeal dysgenesis – a defective formation of the lowest vertebrae in the spine, resulting in a stumped tail
		Variable spinal dysplasia (abnormal development); dysraphism (defective spinal fusion); syringomyelia (cyst in the spinal cord); hydromyelia (enlarged central canal in the spinal cord where excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up); and myelodysplasia (defective development of the bone marrow)
		Weakness in rear limbs (paraparesis), hopping gait
		Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in the Manx breed
	
	
	Myelodysplasia
	
		Defective development of the bone marrow
	
	
	Congenital spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal - malformation from birth, hereditary)




Causes




	Genetic inheritance
	Possibly, exposure of pregnant queens to:
	
		Compounds causing birth defects during fetal development
		Toxins
		Nutritional deficiencies
		Stress
	
	




Diagnosis



You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. A full physical exam will be performed. X-rays of the spinal column (including all vertebrae) can often reveal the exact malformation. If neurological signs (paralysis) are present, a myelography can be used to indicate with precision at which level the spinal cord is compressed. This imaging technique uses a radiopaque substance that is injected into the spine, or into the membranous space that surrounds the spinal cord so that the defects in the spine will be visible on X-ray projections.



Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be helpful, and are in some cases much more sensitive than X-rays. However, myelography is generally the diagnostic imaging technique of choice.







Treatment



Surgery can be helpful for cases involving narrowing of the spinal canal and decompression of the spinal cord. Secondary damage due to spinal compression may be avoided if surgical intervention takes place early on. If the spinal compression is diffuse or long-term, your cat may not respond to surgery. If your cat has an opening in the skin where the spinal malformation is present, it may be surgically repaired.



If your cat is showing neurological signs such as dizziness, seizures or paralysis postoperatively, restricted activity combined with physical therapy may be helpful.



Living and Management



Your cat will need to revisit your veterinarian every four to six months for neurological examinations and to monitor progression of clinical signs. X-rays will be retaken with each follow-up visit as well.



In some cases, management of long term symptoms will be necessary. Fecal and urinary incontinence are common, as well as constipation and urinary tract infections. Medications to soften the feces, an easily digestible diet, and occasional treatment with antibiotics is standard for some cats with spinal malformations.



Cats that have been diagnosed with this defect should not be bred, nor should their parents be bred further, since congenital spinal and vertebral malformations are hereditary. Spaying and neutering is strongly recommended for these animals."," and Types

106,Sperm Ducts Cysts in Cats,"Spermatocele and Sperm Granuloma in Cats
 
Cyst epididymis, or sperm granuloma, is a condition in which a cyst has grown in the epididymis (part of the spermatic duct system), resulting in swelling of the duct or ducts. A spermatocele, meanwhile, is a cyst in the ducts or epididymis that conduct sperm, and is usually associated with a blockage. When sperm escape from these ducts into the surrounding tissue, chronic inflammation occurs. This becomes clinically important when bilateral (both sides) obstruction of the duct system leads to no live sperm in the seminal fluid. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 
It is suspected in cats that have no live sperm yet have normal-sized testes. In addition, it is rarely associated with pain or visible or palpable lesions.
 
Causes
 

    Trauma causing a break in the epididymal duct, where sperm are transported, stored, and matured, which releases sperm antigens into the surrounding tissue
    Adenomyosis - invasion of the epithelial lining cells of the epididymis into the muscular layers may be a factor; it is associated with excess estrogen production
    Overproliferation of cells of the epididymis may be a precursor of adenomyosis
    Complication of vasectomy or partial neuter, especially when surgical technique was not meticulous
    Congenital occlusion (blockage) of the epididymal duct (i.e., the cat was born with this disorder)

 
Diagnosis
 
In making a determination about why your cat’s sperm is deficient, your veterinarian will look at several possibilities, such a testicular degeneration, underdevelopment of the organs, insufficient ejaculation, and incomplete ejaculation. A physical examination will be conducted to look for pain or lesions in the reproductive organs. A urinalysis and possibly a blood test will also be standard for laboratory analysis. It may also be necessary to conduct a surgical testicular biopsy and a biopsy of affected the epididymal tissue to differentiate a benign from a malignant mass.
 

Treatment
 
Cats with insufficient sperm counts rarely spontaneously recover. A bilateral blockage of the epididymis is generally not treatable except by surgical intervention."," and Types
 
It is suspected in cats that have no live sperm yet have normal-sized testes. In addition, it is rarely associated with pain or visible or palpable lesions.
 
"
107,Sperm Abnormalities in Cats,"Spermatozoal Abnormalities in Cats
 
Teratozoospermia is the diagnosis given when spermatozoal (sperm cell) abnormalities are present in 40 percent of the ejaculate. That is, the sperm cells may have short or curled tails, double heads, or head that are too large, too small, or badly shaped. The effect of specific abnormalities on fertility is largely unknown, but optimal fertility is expected in cats that have at least 80 percent morphologically normal spermatozoa.


This condition can affect cats of any age, but older cats are more likely to have other age-related diseases or conditions that affect overall sperm quality. There is no breed predilection.
 
Symptoms
 
Spermatozoal abnormalities are sometimes classified into primary and secondary defects. Primary defects occur during spermatogenesis, the development stage, and secondary defects occur during transport and storage within the epididymis (part of the spermatic duct system). Often there are no outward symptoms of this disorder. The most obvious symptom makes itself apparent in the breeding cat, when the male cat fails to impregnate a breeding partner.
 
Causes
 
Congenital

    Primary ciliary (hair-like cells) dyskinesia (difficulty in performing voluntary movements) – an abnormality of the cilia which results in absent or abnormal motility of the ciliated cells; affected animals are infertile; reported in many breeds; probably autosomal recessive inheritance
    Idiopathic (cause unknown) inherent poor sperm morphology
    Testicular underdevelopment – tortoiseshell or calico tom cats
    Excessive inbreeding – inbreeding in domestic cats can result in a significant reduction in the percentage of normal cells within one generation; wild species with loss of genetic diversity experience an increase in teratozoospermia and a reduction in fertility

 
Acquired

    Conditions disrupting normal testicular thermoregulation (temperature regulation) – trauma; hematocele (swelling due to a flow of blood); hydrocele (collection of fluid in a sac); orchitis (inflammation of the testis); epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymus, the ducts through which the sperm are conveyed); prolonged fever secondary to systemic infections; obesity (increased scrotal fat); inability to adapted to high environmental temperatures; exercise-induced heat exhaustion; seasonal (summer months)
    Infections of the reproductive tract – prostatitis; brucellosis (infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Brucella melitensis); orchitis (inflammation of the testis); epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymus, the ducts through which the sperm are conveyed)
    Drugs
    Testicular cancer
    Prolonged sexual abstinence in a non-neutered male
    Excessive sexual activity
    Testicular degeneration

 


Diagnosis
 
You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, along with any possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as trauma, infection, or travel (as other climates, especially hot climates, may have played a role).
 
A history of your cat's infertility will help your veterinarian to make a diagnosis. For example, has he been infertile after appropriately timed mating to several reproductively-proven queens? Have spermatozoal abnormalities been found during routine breeding soundness evaluation? Your veterinarian will probably do a hormonal profile as well as an examination of the ejaculates (the sperm cells). Your doctor will also test for bacterial infections, and may use visual diagnostic tools to examine the reproductive tract. An ultrasound examination may show whether there is a blockage, orchitis (inflammation of the testis), hydrocele, hemorrhage into a cavity, cyst of the epididymus, or tumor in the testicular region that is affecting the sperm ducts and sperm morphology.

Treatment
 
There is no a specific treatment for spermatozoal abnormalities; if applicable, the underlying disease or condition will be treated. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents will be prescribed for infectious diseases and swelling due to inflammation. Unilateral surgical removal may be recommended for unilateral testicular tumors or severe orchitis. Your veterinarian may recommend sexual rest for edema (swelling) or for a cyst associated with trauma. Frequent semen collection may temporarily improve sperm quality in cats with idiopathic teratozoospermia, but the quality of the sperm will have to be tested before it is used for breeding purposes, to avoid genetic abnormalities resulting from poor sperm.
 
If your cat is in an extremely hot environment, or it is the summer season, protect your cat from high ambient temperatures by moving him to a cooler space. In addition, if your cat is highly active, you may need to alter your cat's activity level to reduce heat stress, unless your veterinarian has specifically ordered more exercise for treatment of obesity.
 
Prevention
 
It may help to provide a climate-controlled environment for your cat if it is not adapted to high environmental temperatures. Also, avoid heat exhaustion during exercise or grooming (e.g., drying cages).
 
Living and Management
 
If an underlying cause is identified and treated, your veterinarian will want to perform a sperm evaluation at 30 and 60 days after the condition is resolved. In cases due to reversible causes, a complete improvement in sperm morphology does not usually occur before 60 days -- the approximate length of a complete spermatogenic cycle.","
 
Spermatozoal abnormalities are sometimes classified into primary and secondary defects. Primary defects occur during spermatogenesis, the development stage, and secondary defects occur during transport and storage within the epididymis (part of the spermatic duct system).

108,Soft Tissue Cancer (Rhabdomyosarcoma) in Cats,"Rhabdomyosarcoma in Cats

Rhabdomyosarcomas are tumors that are often found in the larynx (voice box), the tongue, and in the heart. They arise from striated muscles (banded - not smooth, muscles of the skeletal and cardiac musculature) in adults, and from embryonic stem cells in juveniles. This is a malignant, easily metastasizing (spreading) and aggressive type of tumor. Aggressive and widespread metastasizing can occur in the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, and the adrenal glands. Rhabdomyosarcomas have been reported in relation to vaccine injection-sites in cats.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types


    Large, 	diffuse, soft tissue mass, generally of the skeletal muscle
    May 	spread into the primary muscle (forming multiple nodules)
    If 	tumor is in the heart there may be signs of right-sided congestive 	heart failure


Causes


    Idiopathic 	(unknown)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. While a cytologic (microscopic) examination of a fine-needle aspirate sample may reveal cancer, a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a surgical biopsy (tissue sample).



Treatment

Surgical removal of the tumors, or nodules, should be performed if a cure is desired, but because of the invasive and expansive nature of this tumor, it may not be removable by surgery. If one limb is primarily affected, amputation of the affected limb should be considered. Radiotherapy may be helpful, particularly if the tumor was not entirely removable.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up appointment once a month for the first three months following the initial treatment. Subsequent appointments can then be scheduled every three to six months. If your cat undergoes surgery to have a tumor removed, you will need to closely observe the surgical site every day until it has healed entirely. Your doctor will instruct you in the proper cleaning and dressing techniques for the sutured site. You will need to contact your veterinarian immediately if you see oozing, drainage, swelling, or redness from the surgical site. If you have any questions, contact your veterinarian immediately."," and Types

109,Sodium Deficiency in Cats,"Hyponatremia in Cats

As a component of the extracellular fluid (fluids outside of the cells), sodium is the most abundant positive charged atom in the body. The term hyponatremia refers to a condition in which a cat is suffering from abnormally low concentration of serum sodium in the blood. Hyponatremia usually reflects a concurrent condition of hyposmolality; that is, an underconcentration of osmotic solution in the blood serum -- a lack in the ability of  body fluids to pass through the cellular membranes (osmosis), by which the body's chemical concentrations are kept in balance. Hyposmolality is typically associated with a decreased amount of sodium content throughout the body.

Theoretically, hyponatremia can be caused by either water retention or solute loss (loss of a dissolvable body substance -- in this case, salt/sodium is the solute). Most solute loss occurs in iso-osmotic solutions (e.g., vomit and diarrhea), and as a result, water retention in relation to solute is the underlying cause in almost all patients that are diagnosed with hyponatremia. In general, hyponatremia occurs only when there is a defect in the kidney's ability to excrete water.

Symptoms


    Lethargy
    Weakness
    Confusion
    Nausea/vomiting
    Seizures
    Dullness
    Coma
    Other findings depend on the underlying cause


Causes

Normal osmolar hyponatremia, causes with typical concurrent conditions:

Hyperlipemia – excessive fats in the blood

    Hyperproteinemia
    Hyperosmolar hyponatremia


Hyperglycemia – excessive glucose/sugar in the blood

    Mannitol infusion (a diuretic agent)
    Normovolemic (normal blood volume)


Primary polydipsia – excessive thirst

    Hypothyroid myxedema (a skin and tissue disorder) coma
    Hypotonic fluid infusion (fluid with lower osmotic pressure)
    SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion)
    Hypervolemic (too much fluid in the blood)


Congestive heart failure (CHF)

    Hepatic (liver) cirrhosis
    Nephrotic syndrome (kidney disease where there is abnormal leakage of protein, low levels of proteins in blood and swelling of body parts)
    Hypovolemic (too little fluid in the blood)


Gastrointestinal losses

    Renal (kidney) failure
    Low potassium
    Cutaneous losses
    Diuresis (increased production of urine by the kidney)
    Hypoadrenocorticism (endocrine disorder)




Diagnosis

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. If your cat has hyponatremia, these tests will confirm low serum sodium concentration. Other disorders that can mimic hyponatremia, and which will need to be  excluded, are hyperglycemia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperlipidemia.

Your veterinarian may also recommend testing the serum osmolality will  be tested. The osmolality balance of your cat's urine will be  indicative of the kidney's ability to excrete water, and the sodium  concentration found in the urine may indicate a low volume of  circulating sodium.

Treatment

Primary treatment will depend on the severity of the hyponatremia, and the associated neurological symptoms. The severity of any underlying disorders will guide treatment priorities as well. Treatment generally consists of addressing the underlying cause, and increasing the serum sodium concentration if necessary.

Overly rapid normalization of the hyponatremia can have potentially severe neurological results, and may be more detrimental than the hyponatremia itself. Therefore, an isotonic saline is the fluid of choice in the large majority of cases. More aggressive correction of the serum sodium concentration with hypertonic saline is rarely necessary. Hypervolemic patients (patients with too much fluid in the blood) are typically managed with diuretics (fluid reducers) and salt restriction.

Conversely, hypovolemic patients (patients with too little fluid in the blood) are managed by replacing the volume deficit with isotonic saline. Other therapeutic interventions are dictated by the underlying cause of the hyponatremia.

Living and Management

Initially, your veterinarian will need to observe your cat's response to treatment, repeating serum sodium determinations in order to avoid overly rapid correction of the serum sodium concentrations, and to assure an appropriate response to sodium and other indicated therapies. In addition, your doctor will want to monitor your cat's hydration status and other serum electrolyte concentrations, as indicated by your cat's clinical condition and underlying disorder.","

110,"Snail, Slug Bait Poisoning in Cats","Metaldehyde Poisoning in Cats
 
Slug and snail baits as well as some solid fuel for camp stoves all contain metaldehyde, which is extremely poisonous to cats, primarily affecting their nervous system. This type of poisoning is often seen in coastal and low-lying areas, where use of slug and snail bait is customary. And even though metaldehyde poisoning can be seen in both dogs and cats, it is more common in dogs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Anxiety
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Excessive panting
    Excessive drooling (ptyalism)
    Uncoordinated walk
    Muscle tremors
    Convulsions
    Hyperthermia
    Increased sensitivity to light, touch, and/or sounds
    Increased respiration (hyperpnea)

 
Causes
 
Metaldehyde ingestion.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. The questions may specifically pertain to exposure to slug and snail baits or other sources of metaldehyde. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may be varied. A definitive diagnosis is typically made by verifying the presence of metaldehyde in bodily fluids (e.g., vomitus, stomach contents, and urine).

 


Treatment
 
A cat suffering from metaldehyde poisoning is the type of emergency which will need immediate hospitalization and treatment. Unfortunately, there is no antidote available. The only course of treatment is to eliminate the metaldehyde from the cat's body. Your veterinarian will pump the cat's stomach and, if it is not convulsing, give activated charcoal to absorb the poison in the stomach and intestines. The cat will be restrained to prevent injury. Fluids are also often necessary to rehydrate the cat.
 
Living and Management
 
It is important to not feed a cat that is convulsing or vomiting. Overall prognosis ultimately depends on the amount of metaldehyde ingested, time to treatment, and quality of care provided. If left untreated, however, a cat may die within few hours of ingestion. Watch your cat for vomiting and other symptoms, and call your veterinarian immediately."," and Types

111,Smoke Inhalation in Cats,"Lung Damage Due to Smoke Inhalation in Cats
 
In smoke inhalation, the extent of damage depends on the degree and duration of exposure to smoke and the material that was burning. Injury to the tissue is seen after inhalation of carbon monoxide, which decreases tissue oxygen delivery by binding to red blood cells; inhalation of other toxins that directly irritate the airway (e.g., oxidants and aldehydes); and inhalation of particulate matter that adheres to the airways and small air sacs in the lungs.
 
Cats may have serious lung injury with little evidence of burning on the skin. Lung reaction is initially symptomized by constriction of the lungs, airway swelling, and mucus production, followed by an inflammatory response in the trachea and bronchial area, and fluid accumulation in the lungs. Most patients show progression of lung dysfunction in the initial two to three days after exposure. Follow-up bacterial infections are a common cause of death late in the disease due to the wounded tissue being an advantageous receptor for bacteria.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Smoky odor
    Soot in the nasal or throat passages
    Rapid breathing and increased depth of respiration
    Breathing effort that suggests upper airway obstruction by swelling
    Postural adaptations to respiratory distress (i.e., positioning the body to make breathing easier)
    Mucous membranes may be cherry red, pale, or cyanotic (blue)
    Reddened eyes
    Hoarse cough
    Confusion, fainting
    Vomiting
    Shock

 
Causes
 
Exposure to smoke/carbon monoxide, usually the result of being trapped in a burning building.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as exposure to burning material. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The blood count will show the level of red blood cells that are capable of carrying oxygen, and white cells that are capable of fighting infection. The blood profile will also show whether the arterial blood gases are at normal levels and will show the degree of oxygen shortage in the blood. The urinalysis will show how the kidney is functioning. Visual diagnostics, such as X-ray and ultrasound, may also be used to determine if there is fluid buildup in the lungs. A bronchoscopy, which uses a flexible tube with a camera attached and which can be inserted into the airway, may allow your doctor to determine the severity of airway damage.
 
Samples will be taken of the cells inside your cat’s mouth and airways and cultured to determine whether there are bacteria present. If there is tissue damage to the airways, your veterinarian may prescribe a prophylactic antibiotic to prevent infection.


 
Treatment
 
At the outset, stabilization of the respiratory function and establishment of an effective airway will be the most important. Severe upper airway swelling or obstruction may require intubation or an operation to make an opening in the trachea.
 
Oxygen should be administered immediately after rescue from the fire to displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin (the oxygen carrying pigment of the blood). It will be delivered by mask, hood, oxygen cage, or nasal line. After elimination of carbon monoxide, oxygen supplementation will be continued at 40 to 60 percent as needed. Fluid administration may be required in patients with shock to support cardiovascular function but should be conservative, if possible, to minimize a buildup of fluid in the chest. Blood or plasma transfusions may be necessary to add fresh red and white blood cells to the blood stream. Nutritional support may be needed to maintain body condition and immune status.
 
Living and Managment
 
Your veterinarian will want to carefully monitor your cat’s respiratory rate and effort, mucous membrane color, heart rate and pulse quality, the sound of the lungs, packed cell volume of the blood and total solids for 24 to 72 hours. X-rays will be repeated 48 hours after the initial treatment to ensure that the condition is resolving, and your doctor will also want to monitor your cat’s system for bacterial pneumonia, which is often a side-effect of damage to the lung tissue. Most patients will have some level of deterioration during the initial 24 to 48 hours after smoke exposure and then gradually improve, unless they develop bacterial pneumonia or acute respiratory response syndrome. Severe burns or organ injury are associated with a poor prognosis."," and Types

112,Small Sized Testes in Cats,"Testicular Degeneration and Hypoplasia in Cats

Cats with smaller than normal testes are often not diagnosed until they have attempted to breed and have been unsuccessful, leading to a veterinary check. There are different conditions that can lead to this disorder: underdevelopment or incomplete development of the testes, also known as hypoplasia; and degeneration of the testes, which refers to the loss of potency after the stage of puberty has arrived. The latter condition is more typical in older cats.

Both of these conditions can be due to a condition that was present at birth -- congenital -- or can be due to some other cause that takes place after birth. The congenital forms are  usually related to genetic abnormalities that have been inherited by the parent, but may also be due to something that occurred while the kitten was in utero, such as exposure to radioactive substances or other toxins.

Cats of any age or breed are predisposed to these conditions, but hypoplasia is most commonly seen in young cats, and degeneration is more common in older cats.

Symptoms and Types

In addition to abnormally small testes, infertility is the single most common symptom of these conditions. Semen analysis will show a low sperm count (oligospermia) or an absolute absence of sperms (azoospermia) in the seminal fluid is usually reported.

Causes


    Hypoplasia
    Genetic
    Radiation exposure
    Metal toxicity, including lead
    Chemical toxicity
    Other toxins
    Adverse drug reaction (e.g., antifungal drugs)
    Exposure to heat
    Hormone imbalance
    Tumor of the pituitary gland
    Increasing age
    Degeneration of the testicular sacs
    Injury, trauma
    Inflammation of the testes (orchitis)


Diagnosis
 
Mostly cats  with these conditions are presented to their veterinarians with an owner's complaint of infertility. You will need to give your doctor a complete known health history, including any such problems that were present in the previous generations of your cat's familial line and any trauma or injury that may have affected your cat's scrotum.

Your veterinarian will thoroughly examine the scrotal region and should be able to immediately ascertain whether they are of normal size or are smaller than what they should be for your cat's breed, size and age. A finding of abnormal size is enough to urge your veterinarian to conduct further tests in order to differentiate testicular degeneration from hypoplasia. An ultrasound image of the testes is usually done to confirm the visual diagnosis of smaller than normal testes.



Your veterinarian will also take a semen sample for laboratory testing, to check for abnormal cell development and to do a standard sperm count. The sperm count will evaluate the number of viable sperm cells in your cat's semen. If it appears to be called for, under the circumstances, a small tissue sample may also be taken from the testicular sac, using a fine needle, to be sent to the laboratory for further evaluation.

Treatment

Treatment depends on diagnosis of the underlying cause of degeneration or hypoplasia. Hormonal therapy has been used in animals with these conditions with variable results reported. Your veterinarian will discuss the possibilities of your dog's future fertility using the various treatment protocols that are available, depending on the final diagnosis. Treatment is not available in all cases, but this cannot always be determined without the appropriate tests being conducted first.

If your doctor does determine that treatment is a viable option, follow-up visits will include serial semen analyses to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy.

Living and Management
 
There is no special at home care that is recommended for cats with testicular hypoplasia or degeneration. You may need to take your cat back to the laboratory for subsequent  testing during the period of treatment, but this will be entirely dependent on the diagnosis your veterinarian has settled on and the treatment protocol that has been outlined for him.

Cats with hypoplasia have a poor chance of ever becoming fertile; the chances are a bit better for cats with degeneration of the testes, but in general, the prognosis for successful breeding remains poor. In any case, the final prognosis will depend on the underlying cause and the successful response to treatment."," and Types

"
113,"Slipped Disc, Bad Back, and Muscle Spasms in Cats","Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in Cats



Although intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is seen less frequently in cats than dogs, it is still a serious condition. IVDD occurs when the cushioning discs between the vertebrae of the spinal column either bulge or burst (herniate) into the spinal cord space. These discs then press on the nerves running through the spinal cord causing pain, nerve damage, and even paralysis.



Symptoms and Types



Made up of a gelatinous substance surrounded by a thick outer layer, intervertebral discs are basically the shock absorbers of the spine. There are two types of disc herniation seen in cats: Type I and Type II, of which Type II generally has less severe signs and symptoms.



Symptoms of IVDD may include:




	Unwillingness to jump
	Pain and weakness in rear legs (lameness)
	Anxious behavior
	Crying out in pain
	Muscle spasms over back or neck
	Hunched back or neck with tense muscles
	Reduced appetite and activity level
	Loss of bladder and/or bowel control (urinary and fecal incontinence, respectively)




Causes



In Type I, more commonly found in the neck region, discs develop a hardening (or calcification) of the outer layer. This damages the disc, allowing it to break down easier. Any forceful impact such as jumping and landing can cause one or more disc(s) to burst, and the inner material to press on the spinal cord. With Type II herniation, the discs become hardened and fibrous over a long period of time and eventually break down, bulge out, and compress the spinal cord.



When the nerves of the spinal cord are compressed, the nerve impulses are not able to transmit their signals to the final destination in the limbs, bladder, etc. If the damage is severe enough, paralysis and loss of bladder and bowel control can occur. Depending on the location of the disc that is bulging, signs occur anywhere in the body from the neck to the rear legs. In cats, the discs more commonly bulge in the neck and upper back.



Diagnosis



Examination by your veterinarian will include a complete neurologic exam, which will help identify where in the spinal cord the injury is located. Plain X-rays may show an abnormal area in the spine. However, because the spinal cord does not appear on X-rays, special imaging may be necessary to locate the source of the injury.



Once such procedure, called a myelogram, injects a special dye into the spine, which surrounds the spinal cord and allows it to appear on X-rays. This test requires the animal to be put under anesthesia. In some cases, further testing such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan can also be used to locate where the nerves are being pinched, which is necessary for surgical repair.







Treatment



Depending on the severity of the damage to the spinal cord, treatment can range from conservative to surgical. Conservative care usually includes treatment with drugs such as steroids and anti-inflammatories to reduce the swelling of the cord and reduce pain. The cat must also be kept confined in a crate or cage to prevent further damage from occurring for up to six weeks. After a period of resting, he may gradually return to normal activity.



If the damage is too severe and the cat is paralyzed or incontinent, conservative treatment may not be enough. In these cases, emergency surgery is needed to open up the space. This is done by removing a portion of the bony vertebrae over the spinal cord (laminectomy). Even after surgery, however, the cat may not recover fully.



Most of the animals with IVDD have spasms of the back muscles. Treatment for this symptom usually includes heat and massage techniques along with medications. Commonly used medications include diazepam and methocarbamol. Diazepam is a muscle relaxant which is also used to calm an animal and treat convulsions. Methocarbamol is another muscle relaxant effective in treating muscle spasms caused by IVDD. It acts directly on the nervous system instead of on the muscles themselves.



Living and Management



Many of the cats that have a mild to moderate case of IVDD will get feeling back in their legs and walk again. In addition, those that undergo surgery have a better chance of recovery if they are operated soon after initial diagnosis. Rehabilitation of animals post-surgery is important to help cats regain function and speed recovery.



The quality of life for these cats can be good if given proper nursing care. However, some have subsequent bouts with IVDD later in life and will require life-long care and management.



Prevention



Keeping the cat at a lower weight will help reduce the stress on their backbone and neck. Feeding the cat a good-quality diet should keep her in optimum health, too.



Because of the congenital nature of this disease, your veterinarian will most likely recommend against breeding cats with IVDD."," and Types

114,Skin Ulcers in Cats,"The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy.


What Are Skin Ulcers in Cats?
Skin lesions or ulcers are open sores or wounds in cats that can appear in various ways and involve different layers of the skin. A lesion or ulcer of the skin is a defect that results from a total loss of the top portion of the skin (epidermis) and at least a portion of the deeper layer of skin (dermis). Ulcers or lesions are typically slow to heal, and proper precautions must be taken to prevent infection.

Skin ulcers in cats can be singular or there can be multiple ulcers throughout different areas of the skin. They can occur anywhere on a cat’s body, but are commonly found on the feet, nose, or lips.

Skin ulcers in cats can be caused by a variety of underlying medical conditions but often result from an accident or trauma, burns, or a skin infection. Outdoor cats might have a higher incidence of skin ulcers secondary to trauma or a burn since they have a greater exposure to potential hazards than do indoor cats.

If you suspect your cat has a skin ulcer, it is important to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible to help determine the best treatment plan that will lead to a full recovery.

Symptoms of Skin Ulcers in Cats
Skin ulcers appear as round, open sores in the skin. The outer border of the ulcer might look raised and thick and as an ulcer forms there may be some discoloration of the skin that eventually will start to turn red and feel warm to the touch.

Skin ulcers often leak a clear or pink-tinged fluid, called serum. The serum can dry into a crust on the surface of the ulcer, which may appear as a scab from dried blood or pus. An infected ulcer can crack and open producing thick, white pus.

Skin ulcers are painful to cats, which may cause them to display other systemic signs such as:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Sense of increased itching and scratching
	
	
	Hiding, not acting like themselves
	
	
	Signs of stress such as vomiting, diarrhea, or urinary accidents
	


Causes of Skin Ulcers in Cats
Skin ulcers can be the result of many different causes including:


	
	Burns—thermal, electrical, solar, or chemical burns
	
	
	Trauma
	
	
	Drug reactions or side effects to medications
	
	
	Infectious conditions:

	
		
		Viruses, such as FIV and FeLV
		
		
		Bacterial infections
		
	
	
	
	Fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis (deep fungal infections) or ringworm (a superficial fungal infection)
	
	
	Parasitical infections­, such as mange or flea bite allergies
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Autoimmune diseases
	
	
	Nutritional disorders
	
	
	Frostbite
	
	
	Venomous snake or insect bites
	
	
	Urine scald (secondary to urinary incontinence)
	
	
	Self-mutilation
	
	
	Insect, mosquito, or tick bites
	
	
	Idiopathic (cause unknown)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Skin Ulcers in Cats
Your veterinarian will want a full medical history to perform a complete physical examination. Any history of itchy skin, change in diet, exposure to infectious organisms, and recent travel will be taken into consideration. Your vet will need to know when the skin ulcers were first noted, where your cat spends most of its time, and what medications and/or preventions are taken regularly. Since there are various causes of skin ulcers, diagnosis can involve several different tests.

Testing may include:


	
	Skin culture: A large cotton swab is used to sample the surface of the ulceration for the presence of bacteria or fungus.
	
	
	Skin aspiration or aspiration of fluids: A very small needle is passed into the skin lesion to remove cells. An aspiration can also be done to remove any fluid cells from the ulceration. The cells are then placed on a microscope slide and examined for the presence of any abnormal cells or organisms that could cause the skin ulcer.
	
	
	Skin biopsy: A part of the ulcer (and some surrounding tissue) is surgically removed. The biopsied tissue is examined in a laboratory to help determine the underlying cause of the skin ulcer.
	


Treatment of Skin Ulcers in Cats
Treatment varies depending on the underlying cause of the condition. A treatment plan will be designed for your cat’s specific diagnosis and to alleviate symptoms. Most causes of skin ulcers can be treated with oral or topical medications. If your cat has become systemically ill, it might have to stay in the hospital for a few days for supportive care which includes IV fluids, pain medication, antibiotics, and other treatments.

For benign, solitary ulcers, or those contained within a small area, topical medications might be considered. If an ulcer is caused by a cancerous process, your veterinarian might recommend surgical removal of the lesions. Surgery is best performed on cats that are not systemically ill and those that do not have signs of spread of disease. Spread of disease (i.e., not contained to just the skin) could be indicated by lesions inside the chest or abdomen.  

Pain medications, anti-inflammatory medications, steroids, antibiotics, and antifungals such as Buprenorphine or NSAIDs for pain, Prednisone, Clavamox, and Ketoconazole are among the most common medications used for skin ulcers in cats. It is important to never use any creams, solutions, or alcohols on a cat’s skin lesions without talking to your veterinarian first, as some remedies can make the lesions worse.

Recovery and Management of Skin Ulcers in Cats
Follow-up care depends on the underlying cause and the severity of the skin ulcer. Always follow instructions from your veterinarian when it comes to medication administration and check-up appointments. If skin ulcers get worse at any time, contact your veterinarian immediately.

If your cat requires surgery, a follow-up appointment will be needed to make sure that the surgery site is healing normally and to remove any suture or staples. It’s always recommended to use a recovery or e-collar to protect the skin lesions even after the medications are finished or the stitches have been removed. This ensures that your cat does not self-harm the area.

Prevention of Skin Ulcers in Cats

To help prevent skin ulcers in cats, it’s important to have your cat examined by its veterinarian at least once a year for their annual checkup. If you notice any ulcers on your cat, contact your veterinarian immediately. Always make sure your cat is never exposed to anything that could cause a burn, and that it is always in a safe environment to avoid injuries. If your cat spends time outdoors, ensure that they have plenty of shade, especially during hot summer months. Brushing and grooming a cat often helps the owner keep a close eye on the pet’s skin for any developing lesions.

115,Skin Tumor (Histiocytoma) in Cats,"Histiocytoma in Cats
 
The Langerhans  cells are immune cells that function to provide protective immunity to the tissues that are in contact with the outer environment -- the nose, stomach, intestines and lungs, but mainly the skin's surface. These cells are also referred to as dendritic cells, and histiocytes. A histiocytoma is a benign skin tumor that originates in the Langerhans  cells.

Histiocytomas are rare in cats, but its occurrence is not limited by breed, age or gender.
 
Symptoms
 

    Small,      firm, dome or button-shaped masses on the skin surface
    Rare      autoimmune blistering (dermoepithelial) masses, which may be ulcerated
    Fast      growing, nonpainful, usually solitary
    Common      sites are the head, ears, and limbs
    Occasionally      multiple skin nodules or plaques

 
Causes
 
Unknown
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms, after which your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Most of these tests return as normal. 
 
Other diagnostic tests include a cytologic examination (a microscopic examination of the cells) using a sample gathered by fine-needle aspirate. This may reveal pleomorphic round cells (cells taking one or more forms), with variable-sized and -shaped nuclei. It is common to find that the mitotic index (a measure of the proliferation, or fast production status of a cell population) is high. The tests may also show evidence of substantial lymphocyte (white blood cell in the vertebrate immune system), plasma cell, and neutrophil (the most abundant type of white blood cells) infiltration.
 


Treatment
 
Since some treatments can adversely affect malignant tumors, important to differentiate histiocytoma, a benign growth of tissue, from a malignant tumor. Your veterinarian will talk to you about this, and will give you the option of taking a wait-and-see approach. If you do have the tumor diagnosed conclusively, and it is found to be a histiocytoma, the usual method of treatment is surgical excision of the mass, or cryosurgery, which is conducted with a laser. Either one is generally curative.

If the mass is left alone, it may spontaneously regress within three months. This is a decision that you will have to make once you have been informed of every possible eventuality, and every treatment method that is available for your cat.
 
Living and Management
 
Surgical excision of the mass is recommended if the mass has not spontaneously regressed within three months. With removal of the mass, the long-term prognosis is generally excellent.","

Cutaneous drug eruptions can vary markedly in clinical appearance and pathophysiology – the functional change that accompanies the disease. They can cover a spectrum of diseases and clinical signs, and it is likely that many mild drug reactions go unnoticed or unreported; thus, incidence rates for specific drugs are unknown and most of the facts available on drug-specific reactions have been extrapolated from reports in the human literature.



Some types of drug reactions appear to have a familial basis.



Symptoms and Types




	Itchiness, excessive scratching
	Flat, small red patches and bumps
	Exfoliative erythroderma, a condition where at least 50 percent of the skin's body surface area turns bright red and scaly
	Scales
	Hives
	Allergies
	Skin redness and swelling
	Patches of darker skin or plaques (round patches) that expand and may clear in the center, producing a bull’s-eye appearance
	Blistering skin due to drug-induced pemphigus/pemphigoid (a rare autoimmune disorder of the skin)




Causes




	Drugs of any type
	Exfoliative erythroderma (peeling redness):
	
		Most often associated with shampoos and dips
		Commonly seen with reactions to topical ear medications, usually in the ear canals and on concave pinnae (outer part of the ear)
	
	
	Can occur after the first dose of the drug, or after weeks to months of administration of the same drug due to sensitization (when the body becomes hypersensitive after repeated exposure to a material)




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what is causing the skin reaction and whether the problem needs to be treated on a deeper level or is only an external condition. veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. The exam will include a full dermatologic exam, with skin scrapings for lab culturing in order to rule out or confirm bacterial and fungal infections. A skin biopsy may also be indicated. Your veterinarian will also order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis.









Treatment



If is is found that the reaction is coming from an external source, you will need to discontinue use of any shampoos or other topical preparations. Also keep in mind cleaning products that you are using, since it is possible that your cat is reacting to floor cleaners, or other cleaning agents. If it is found to be drug based, your veterinarian will find a suitable replacement for the medication. If the diagnosis is Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS), or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), both potentially fatal drug based skin reactions, your cat will need to be treated on an inpatient basis. Intensive supportive care and fluid/nutritional support will be administered, and relief for the pain that is associated with these conditions can be given.



For chronic and persistent idiopathic erythema multiforme (EM), a skin disease of unknown cause, azathioprine is often effective. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used successfully for severe EM and TEN when not spontaneously resolving, but it is often cost-prohibitive.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your cat, depending on the cause of and severity of your cat’s skin disease. If your cat’s skin condition relapses or worsens, you will need to contact your veterinarian as soon as possible."," and Types

117,Skin Rash Due to Contact with Irritants in Cats,"Contact Dermatitis

Dermatitis due to allergy is rare in young animals, and is extremely rare in cats unless they are exposed to insecticides that contain oil extracted from a citrus rind, a common allergen. Contact dermatitis may be caused by an allergy, or it may simply mean that your cat has touched something that has irritated its skin, such as the sap in poison ivy, or salt on a road. It is usually limited to one area; an overall reaction, as from shampoo, is uncommon. It can be difficult to distinguish one cause from another because the symptoms usually appear the same. If it seems to occur at certain seasons, it may indicate that the offending source is a plant or outdoor compound.

Allergic reactions require a previous, sensitizing experience with the irritant. The next contact with the irritant is when symptoms tend to occur. Some animals can have reactive dermatitis from medications. Allergies can occur at any age, and are a direct result of the irritating nature of the offending compound and the body's particular reaction to it.

Symptoms and Types

Cats suffering from contact dermatitis will most likely be afflicted with rashes and/or bumps where the skin has come into contact with the ground (i.e., the chin, neck, chest, abdomen, groin, anal area, scrotum, tail, and between the toes). These rashes may stop abruptly at the hairline. Other common symptoms include severe itching and swelling.

Causes

Factors and/or substances that have been reported to be skin irritants are:

    Plants
    Mulch/Cedar chips
    Herbicides
    Fertilizers
    Fabrics
    Plastics
    Rubber
    Leather
    Rugs
    Carpets
    Concrete
    Metal
    Rough surfaces
    Soaps
    Detergents
    Floor waxes/cleaning products – 	especially those containing citrus oil
    Carpet and litter deodorizers
    Sensitivity to the sun/heat
    Topical agents
    Medications
    Food allergy
    Insect bites (bees, wasps)
    Bacterial infection
    Fungal infection (e.g., ringworm)
    Lupus
    Dandruff
    Flea collars
    Parasitic hypersensitivity or 	infestation (e.g., mites, fleas)
    Insecticides, including newer 	topical flea treatments; those including citrus rind are more likely 	to cause reactions in cats


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. To avoid aggravating the condition, the symptoms cannot be treated until tests have been completed. Your veterinarian's first task will be to find out what the offending irritant, or trigger, is.  There are several ways to approach tracking down the triggers. One is to do what is called a patch test: the suspected substance is placed on a patch and taped to the skin for 48 hours. Any reaction is then assessed. The second method is to remove the pet from the offending environment for a period of time and then return it to the environment, monitoring what happens and whether it has had any impact one way or the other. An allergy diary, where you keep a record of your cat's immediate environment, daily diet, and known activities can help you to narrow the possible causes for your cat's symptoms.

Your veterinarian will also want to perform bacterial cultures. A clip of hair may be taken from a patch of skin in an area that is not affected, applied to a sample of the suspected antigen, and observed for possible reaction. Skin biopsies may also be required for making a definitive diagnosis.

   

Treatment


    Eliminate the offending 	substance(s)
    Bathe with hypoallergenic shampoos 	to remove the antigen from the skin
    Create mechanical barriers, if 	possible, to restrict your pet from the offending environment


Living and Management

The most important, yet difficult thing to do is to remove your cat from the environment that brought on the condition. If the dermatitis resulted form an irritant and not an allergy, recovery will be quick once the irritant is identified. If the dermatitis is the result of an allergy, it may have developed over months or years. If your pet is exposed again, symptoms will be apparent from three to five days following exposure. The symptoms may then persist for weeks. If the antigen can be identified and removed, a return to normal health generally takes place within a few weeks. If you are not able to identify the allergen, there is a possibility that you will have to treat the symptoms with medications for the rest of your cat's life."," and Types

118,Skin Inflammation Due to Allergies (Atopy) in Cats,"Atopic Dermatitis in Cats 



Atopic Dermatitis is an inflammatory, chronic skin disease associated with allergies. These allergic reactions can be brought on by normally harmless substances like grass, mold spores, house dust mites, and other environmental allergens. 



Furthermore, dogs are more prone to atopic dermatitis than cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types 



Often symptoms associated with atopic dermatitis progressively worsen with time, though they become more apparent during certain seasons. The most commonly affected areas in cats include the: 




	Ears
	Wrists
	Ankles
	Muzzle
	Underarms
	Groin
	Around the eyes
	In between the toes 




The signs associated with atopic dermatitis, meanwhile, consist of itching, scratching, rubbing, and licking, especially around the face, paws, and underarms.



Causes 



Early onset is often associated with a family history of skin allergies. This may lead the cat to become more susceptible to allergens such as:




	Animal danders
	Airborne pollens (grasses, weeds, trees, etc.)
	Mold spores (indoor and outdoor)
	House dust mite




Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history to determine the underlying cause of the skin allergies, including a physical examination of the cat. Serologic allergy testing may be performed, but it does not always have reliable results. The quality of this kind of testing often depends on the laboratory which analyzes the results. Intradermal testing, whereby small amounts of test allergens are injected in the skin and wheal (a red bump) response is measured, may also used to identify the cause of your pet's allergic reaction.





Treatment 



The treatment will depend on what is causing your pet’s allergic reaction. If the reaction is due to atopy, for example, hyposensitization therapy can be performed. Your veterinarian will give your pet injections of the allergens to which it is sensitive.  This decreases itchiness in 60 to 80 percent of cats, but may approximately take six months to a year to see an improvement.



Medicines such as corticosteroids and antihistamines can also be given to control or reduce itching. Cyclosporine is effective in controlling itching associated with long-term skin allergies, while sprays can be used over large body surfaces to control itching with minimal side effects.

 

Living and Management 



Unfortunately, atopic dermatitis only rarely goes into remission or spontaneously resolves. However, bathing your cat in cool water with anti-itch shampoos may help your alleviate its symptoms.



Once treatment has begun, your veterinarian must see the cat every 2 to 8 weeks to ascertain the effectiveness of the treatment and to check for drug interactions. Then, as your pet's itching becomes well controlled, it will need to be brought into the veterinarian's office every 3 to 12 months for checkups. 



If your veterinarian should find the trigger for your pet's allergies, he or she will advise you as to how to best avoid those type of allergens."," and Types

119,Skin Infections in Cats,"What Are Skin Infections in Cats?
The skin is the largest organ in a cat’s body, making up a quarter of total body weight. A wide variety of conditions can lead to skin infections, including parasites, allergies, wounds, and other infectious agents. Due to a cat’s thick fur, some cases of skin infection won’t even be visible to a pet parent, while others will.

Some conditions that cause skin infections in cats are dependent on geographic location, lifestyle, gender, and breed of cat. Cats that spend time outdoors have a greater chance of developing a skin infection from conditions like external parasites or injuries. Skin infections can occur anywhere on a cat’s body, but they are found most often on the belly, back, and base of the tail.

Types of Skin Infections in Cats


	
	Bacterial skin infections, or pyoderma, commonly caused by Staphylococcus
	
	
	Fungal infections, such as ringworm and yeast infections
	
	
	Allergy infections, especially miliary dermatitis
	
	
	Skin parasites, primarily fleas, mange, and mites

Symptoms of Skin Infections in Cats

	Excessive scratching, licking, and/or chewing of the fur
	
	Fur loss
	
	
	Redness or swelling
	
	
	Red bumps and/or scabs
	
	
	Pustules (similar to pimples, with a white head on a raised bump)
	
	
	Scaly or flaky skin
	
	
	Wounds
	
	
	Skin odor
	


Causes of Skin Infections in Cats
Bacterial Skin Infections

Bacterial infections, or pyoderma, can occur on the surface of the skin, within the layers of the skin, or under the skin of cats. They can affect cats of any age or gender and can be found anywhere on a cat’s body. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pasteurella multocida are bacteria commonly known for causing this condition.

Red skin lesions, such as bumps or pustules, and partial hair loss are the main characteristics of a bacterial skin infection. Cats, like all animals, including humans, have a normal amount of bacteria on the skin. When cats have an itch, wound, or other condition that disturbs and irritates the skin, those bacteria overpopulate and cause a skin infection.

While a bacterial skin infection can happen in any breed, cats with shorter coats, skin folds, and pressure calluses are more prone to these types of infections. Cats are also at a much higher risk of developing a pyoderma when they have other conditions, including:


	
	Fungal infection
	
	
	Endocrine disease
	
	
	Allergies to parasites
	
	
	Allergies to food
	
	
	Allergies to the environment
	


Fungal Infections

Fungal skin infections are commonly picked up when cats come in direct contact with another infected animal or with the spores produced by the fungi. Dermatophytosis, or ringworm, is the most common fungal skin infection in cats. Many fungal infections that affect a cat’s skin also cause issues to the respiratory system. When the infectious spores from the fungus contact the skin or the nails of a cat, they can replicate and cause a noticeable skin disease.

Allergy Infections

Allergic skin disease in cats can be caused by:


	
	Food
	
	
	Medication
	
	
	Airborne elements (dust, pollen, and mold are most common)
	
	
	Insects
	
	
	Irritating substances that encounter a cat’s skin
	


Allergies often cause an intense feeling of itchiness and cats will develop secondary skin infections to these underlying allergies. Flea allergic dermatitis is the most common allergic skin disease in cats. It only takes one microscopic flea egg on an allergic cat’s skin to ignite a full body skin reaction.

Skin Parasites

Parasites that cause skin disease in cats are relatively common. Fleas are most likely the culprit. Cats are also susceptible to several types of mange, including:


	
	Canine scabies (Sarcoptic mange)
	
	
	Feline scabies
	
	
	Ear mites
	
	
	Walking dandruff (cheyletiellosis)
	
	
	Trombiculosis (Chiggers)
	


Demodicosis is not considered mange, but it is caused by mites.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Skin Infections in Cats
If you see any abnormality on your cat’s skin, or your cat is showing any signs of itchiness, pain, or discomfort, have them examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Diagnosing the underlying cause of skin disease in cats can be difficult, although in some cases, the cause can be easier to determine. A thorough medical history should be taken to include previous medical conditions, a parasite-prevention regimen, and dietary changes.

Your cat’s medical history can provide information about:


	
	Potential exposure to things that may cause skin infections (including fleas)
	
	
	Behaviors that may suggest a cause (like scratching, which suggests itchiness)
	
	
	Response to therapy
	


A physical examination will help your veterinarian determine the pattern of the skin abnormality, such as hair loss, redness, and presence of parasites.

Your veterinarian will use certain diagnostic tools to determine the underlying cause of the infection–to know how best to treat it. If a bacteria or yeast infection is suspected, your vet will do an acetate test, which involves pressing a piece of sticky tape on the skin lesion and then examining the tape under a microscope.

For fungal infections, such as ringworm, your vet will do a culture by pulling a few hairs on and around the skin lesion. A skin scraping is done to look for mites and mange. Blood and urine tests, along with skin biopsies, are done in more severe cases when other forms of diagnosis are unhelpful. Your veterinarian may also evaluate how your cat responds to treatment to diagnose a specific skin problem. More than one visit is often required for an accurate diagnosis.

Treatment of Skin Infections in Cats
In order to treat a skin infection successfully, a proper diagnosis is needed. With some diagnoses, it can take a few days to get lab results. In the meantime, most veterinarians will start treating your cat’s symptoms to alleviate itch or discomfort while they wait for a more specific treatment plan to be made upon a definitive diagnosis.

Treatment for most skin infections involves a combination of oral medications and topical products, such as shampoos, creams, sprays, and mousses. The following are common ingredients in both oral and topical therapy:


	
	Antibiotics

	
		
		Oral antibiotics

		
			
			Clavamox (and other Amoxicillin based drugs)
			
			
			 Cephalexin
			
			
			Clindamycin
			
		
		
		
		Injectable antibiotic

		
			
			Convenia
			
		
		
		
		Topical antibacterial­­

		
			
			Chlorhexidine
			
		
		
	
	
	
	Antifungals

	
		
		Oral antifungals­

		
			
			Ketoconazole
			
			
			Itraconazole
			
			
			Terbinafine
			
			
			Fluconazole
			
		
		
		
		Topical antifungals­­

		
			
			Miconazole
			
		
		
	
	
	
	Antihistamines

	
		
		Chlorpheniramine
		
		
		Clemastine
		
		
		Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
		
		
		Hydroxizine
		
	
	
	
	Anti-inflammatories

	
		
		Meloxicam
		
		
		Onsior
		
	
	
	
	Steroids

	
		
		Prednisolone
		
		
		Dexamethasone
		
	
	
	
	Antiparasiticides

	
		
		Lime sulfur dip, and some topical and oral flea preventions such as Selemectin and Fluralaner
		
	
	


Dietary changes will most likely need to be made if your vet suspects a food allergy.

Flea infestations should be eliminated by treating the cat and all other pets in the home, in addition to the indoor and outdoor environment. As with any treatment plan, it is critical that you read and understand all directions for using the prescribed flea-removal product. In many cases of skin infection in cats, the cause may be transmissible to other cats (and, in some cases, to people), so preventing transmission to other animals or humans is important to a successful treatment.

Recovery and Management of Skin Infections in Cats
Depending on the underlying cause and severity of the skin infection, the prognosis is often favorable. Infections that come from an underlying systemic disease, however, may have a more guarded prognosis.

For most skin infections, oral medications will need to be given for at least 2 weeks but often longer, depending on the diagnosis. A common reason for treatment failure is the pet parent missing doses or not completing the full course of medication prescribed. Topical therapies, including parasite preventatives, should be used for the rest of the cat’s life.  

All medications should be completed even if your cat’s skin already looks better–this ensures the recovery is complete. Routine bathing of the cat’s wounds in benzoyl peroxide or other medicated shampoos can reduce the infection and will help after to prevent recurrence.

120,Skin Infections and Loss of Skin Color Disorders in Cats,"Dermatoses, Depigmenting Disorders

Skin dermatoses is a medical term that can be applied to any number of bacterial infections of the skin or genetic diseases of the skin. Some dermatoses are cosmetic conditions involving loss of pigmentation of the skin and/or hair coat, but are otherwise not harmful.
 
Symptoms and Types


    White hair (known as leukotrichia)
    Partial or total lack of pigment in the skin (known as leukoderma)
    Reddening of the skin (known as erythema)
    Loss of the top surface of the skin (known as an erosion or ulceration, based on depth of tissue loss)
    Siamese cats may be disposed to a condition characterized by symmetrical lack of pigment in the skin and a white hair coat, especially involving the face and nose



Causes


    Bacterial skin infections; the most commonly affected areas are:
    
        Lips
        Eyelids
        Nostrils
    
    
    Fungal infection of skin
    Contact hypersensitivity (allergies)
    Skin on face tends to be primarily affected
    Red skin and pus - face and ears
    Crusting scabs and pus on skin
    Loss of skin/hair color after skin was inflamed
    Loss of color on nose and lips, vision loss
    Seasonal nasal depigmentation
    Inflammation of the arteries of the nasal philtrum (very front of nose, above upper lip)
    Albinism (genetic)
    Vitiligo (smooth white patches of skin due to loss of skin color)
    Severe: skin and bodily organs affected
    Autoimmune disease (often there is a genetic predisposition)
    Systemic lupus erythematosus
    Discoid lupus erythematosus
    Pemphigus foliaceus
    Pemphigus erythematosus
    Uveodermatologic syndrome
    Hormonal disorders
    Drug reaction


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as whether your cat suffered a recent infection. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. Blood samples can be tested for autoimmune factors.

As part of your cat’s physical exam, your veterinarian will take skin samples and skin scrapings to send to a lab for bacterial and fungal cultures. If the skin biopsy shows that skin cells are separating from each other (acantholytic), this is diagnostic for pemphigus. Direct immunofluorescence of skin samples using fluorescent dyes can also be used to demonstrate antibodies. Your veterinarian may also take fluid samples from your cat’s joints to check for lupus.

Treatment

Unless your cat is suffering from multiple organ dysfunction caused by lupus, treatment may be performed on an outpatient basis. Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian if a bacterial or fungal infection is present. Immunosuppressive medication is often prescribed for autoimmune disorders. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist if your cat's eyes are affected. Unless topical medications or ointments have been specifically prescribed by your veterinarian for your pet, any preparation should be avoided.

Living and Management

You will need to protect your cat from exposure to the sun if it has been diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus, or pemphigus erythematosus. You can easily apply a water resistant sunblock with an SPF of greater than 30 to depigmented areas of your cat's skin if it does need to be outside during the day. If your cat is exposed to plastic or rubber dishes (especially if the dishes have roughened edges which might cause abrasions), they will need to be replaced.

If your cat's skin condition worsens, you will need to contact your veterinarian, since it may indicate something more serious that is underlying the skin condition, such as a spreading infection or organ involvement. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to monitor your cat’s skin ailment. Animals that are taking immunosuppressive medications (for autoimmune diseases) should have frequent blood work tests performed."," and Types

121,Skin Fungal Infections in Cats,"What Are Skin Fungal Infections in Cats?
This type of skin infection is caused by fungi, which are parasitic, spore-producing organisms that are widespread in the environment. Fungal spores are very hardy and can remain in the environment for years. Cats pick up these spores from direct contact with an infected animal or directly in the environment, mostly through the soil.

Fungal infections can cause a variety of issues from skin infections to respiratory diseases. When the infective spores from the fungus contact the skin or nails of the cat, it can replicate.

Most healthy, adult animals have strong immune systems to fight off fungal infections, but stress, illness, and a weak immune system can predispose cats to getting fungal infections. Fungal infections take advantage of this weakness and invade the skin’s normally protective barrier. Skin fungal infections are more common in warm and humid conditions.

Many fungal infections are zoonotic, which means they can also infect humans. It is important to contact your health provider if your pet has been diagnosed or is suspected of having a fungal disease.

Types of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats

Dermatophytosis is the most common skin fungal infection in cats. These fungal infections are commonly called “ringworm.” Ringworm is not caused by a worm as the name implies, but by a fungus. A classic ringworm lesion involves a slowly expanding ring-like pattern of hair loss and scale, although this isn’t always the case. Some cats may have ringworm with no skin conditions or in other patterns of hair loss and scale.

Cats are usually infected with the fungus Microsporum canis, but other fungi include Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. When infected, some cats may be asymptomatic carriers of ringworm and exhibit very few clinical signs, yet they are still capable of spreading the infection.

Other less-common fungal infections that infect the skin of cats include:


	
	Cryptococcosis: A fungal disease that may cause respiratory, nervous system, ocular (eye), and skin lesions. It is transmitted through the soil and in bird droppings, particularly from pigeons.
	
	
	Coccidioidomycosis: Also known as “valley fever” or “desert fever” it can be found in dry and semi-arid regions. Infections commonly occur after dust storms, heavy rain, construction, or earthquakes. This fungal infection typically causes systemic disease, but skin lesions include non-healing masses, hair loss, and draining wounds.
	
	
	Blastomycosis: This zoonotic fungal infection primarily causes respiratory and neurologic disease in cats, most notably pneumonia. Blastomyces can also look like skin masses and abscesses in cats. This disease is usually restricted to certain states around the Ohio River basin, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence Seaway.
	
	
	Candidiasis: A fungal organism that is naturally found on the skin of a cat. Infections occur most commonly in association with immunosuppression.
	
	
	Malassezia yeast: A natural inhabitant of the skin that may cause overgrowth, especially in the skin and ears. Secondary to allergies, dermatological and endocrine conditions, it has been associated with some cancers in cats. Rex cats are predisposed to Malassezia infections.
	
	
	Cutaneous sporotrichosis: A zoonotic fungal disease that creates nodules (lumps) under the skin and draining wounds. A draining wound is an injury that penetrates the skin and usually the immediate tissue underneath, often forming tunnel-like lesions. It may be swollen, red, or infected and exude a discharge of blood or pus.

	
		
		Male outdoor cats are most often infected due to increased roaming and exposure to contaminated thorns, splinters, dirt, and soil. It is also transmitted through fights with other cats. Sporotrichosis can also become systemic and affect the liver, lungs, and bone.
		
	
	
	
	Rhinosporidiosis: Typically, a disease of the nasal membranes, it can also infect a cat’s skin causing nodules or polyps with a stalk or stem.
	
	
	Phaeohyphomycosis: This is a group of fungal infections that cause skin masses and draining wounds around the paws, ears, and face. Occasionally, it can invade the nervous system.
	
	
	Mycetomas: An infection that causes skin or abdominal tissue swelling, a mycetoma will often produce a discharge that displays pigmented granules. These fungi are opportunistic and often infect cats after traumatic injuries, or through wounds from surgery.
	


Symptoms of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Fungal infections may be superficial, causing hair loss, redness, scaling, crusting, increased pigmentation, and pustules (bulging patch of skin). Infected hair follicles may be removed easily, but more severe fungal infections create under the skin nodules, draining tracts, and abscesses. Secondary bacterial infections are also common.

Many fungal infections are capable of invading the body causing a systemic disease that most commonly affects the lungs and the nervous system. Non-dermatologic clinical signs include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Breathing difficulty
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Blindness
	
	
	Seizures
	


Causes of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungus is found commonly in the environment. The pathogenic, or disease-causing species, are usually found in soil, but can be spread through contaminated materials and other animals. Cats can get fungal infections through direct exposure, typically through the skin with a broken barrier, as well as breathing in or ingesting spores.

Fungi are opportunistic and take advantage of a host’s weakened immune system, wounds, and concurrent infections. Bacterial infections and fungal infections are often diagnosed together, although it can be difficult to figure out which came first.

While indoor cats can get fungal infections, outdoor, roaming cats have a higher exposure to fungal elements. Some cats may be asymptomatic carriers and show no symptoms, yet they can spread the disease to other animals and humans.

Longhaired cat breeds such as Persians and Himalayans may have a predisposition to skin fungal infections.

Based on lifestyle and clinical signs of hair loss, crusting, and scaling, veterinarians may suspect a fungal skin infection. They may use a variety of tests to diagnose fungal infections as well as other common diseases (such as bacterial or parasitic infections) that show up similarly.


	
	Deep skin scrapes and cytology: While fungal structures are not commonly found during this process, skin scrapes and cytology are used to diagnose concurrent bacterial infections and mite infestations. Yeast infections also are commonly diagnosed with cytology.
	
	
	Wood’s lamp examination: Some types of fungal species will fluoresce bright green under this lamp, most commonly M. canis. However, it is possible to have false positives and false negatives, so the Wood’s lamp should only be used as a screening tool.
	
	
	Trichogram: In this test, a hair follicle and scale from the edge of a lesion is evaluated under a microscope for evidence of fungal structures.
	
	
	Dermatophyte culture: This is the gold standard of testing and involves taking samples of skin lesions and allowing them to develop on a growth medium for two to three weeks. Any growth is recorded and analyzed for species identification.
	
	
	Biopsy: Biopsy (removal of tissue for examination) may be best used in non-healing wounds and masses that are surgically removed.
	
	
	PCR: Some laboratories can run these tests to identify fungal DNA.
	


Treatment of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Surgical removal of nodules, draining tracts, and abscesses may be the preferred treatment method in some types of infection. All surgical lesions should be biopsied for a definitive diagnosis.

All concurrent illnesses—such as bacterial infections, allergies, parasitic infestations, or diseases causing immunosuppression—should be tested and treated as necessary.

Skin lesions involving scales, crusts, and hair loss are most often treated with oral anti-fungal medications such as Itraconazole, Terbinafine, and Fluconazole. Not all antifungals are safe in cats, so it is important to only use medications prescribed by your veterinarian. These drugs are typically given long term (over months) and require treatment for three to four weeks after resolution. Clinical resolution involves not only the disappearance of clinical signs, but also two negative fungal cultures.

Other animals in the house may also be treated to prevent asymptomatic carrier status.

Recurrences are common, and cleaning contaminated materials within the house is crucial. Bedding should be washed daily and areas difficult to decontaminate (such as carpet) should be avoided. Pet parents may wish to discard non-washable items, such as cat trees or toys, as they may be a continuous source of re-infection.

Topical antifungal therapy, such as lime sulfur dip or shampoos containing miconazole, are effective at eliminating spores on the hair coat and decreasing the spread of disease. Topical therapy is typically recommended throughout the entire treatment process.

Recovery and Management of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Overall, the prognosis for skin fungal infections is good to excellent. Pet parents should expect multiple re-check exams with the veterinarian throughout treatment. Cats are not considered cured until clinical signs are resolved and they have two negative fungal cultures. After this, treatment should continue for another month.

Causes of immunosuppression should be evaluated, including steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and diseases such as cancer.

Most cats recover fully from fungal infections with time and treatment. Consistent treatment and thorough environmental decontamination are important for success. Relapses are common, so patience and commitment to a cure are vital for pet parents working with their veterinarians.
Skin Fungal Infections in Cats FAQsWhat does a skin fungal infection look like on a cat? Most often, cats with skin fungal infections have hair loss, dryness, scaling, crusts, redness, and increased pigmentation.
Can you catch fungal infections from cats? Yes, the most common form of fungal infection in cats is transmissible to humans.
Can cat fungus go away on its own? While healthy, immune-competent cats may be able to resolve a fungal infection on their own, they may become asymptomatic carriers and continue spreading the disease. It is important to talk to your veterinarian if you think your cat had or has a fungal disease.
How do cats get fungal infections? Most fungal infections are spread from contaminated soil, materials, or other cats.

Fungal infections may be superficial, causing hair loss, redness, scaling, crusting, increased pigmentation, and pustules (bulging patch of skin). Infected hair follicles may be removed easily, but more severe fungal infections create under the skin nodules, draining tracts, and abscesses. Secondary bacterial infections are also common.

Many fungal infections are capable of invading the body causing a systemic disease that most commonly affects the lungs and the nervous system. Non-dermatologic clinical signs include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Breathing difficulty
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Blindness
	
	
	Seizures
	


Causes of Skin Fungal Infections in Cats
Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungus is found commonly in the environment. The pathogenic, or disease-causing species, are usually found in soil, but can be spread through contaminated materials and other animals. Cats can get fungal infections through direct exposure, typically through the skin with a broken barrier, as well as breathing in or ingesting spores.

Fungi are opportunistic and take advantage of a host’s weakened immune system, wounds, and concurrent infections. Bacterial infections and fungal infections are often diagnosed together, although it can be difficult to figure out which came first.

While indoor cats can get fungal infections, outdoor, roaming cats have a higher exposure to fungal elements. Some cats may be asymptomatic carriers and show no symptoms, yet they can spread the disease to other animals and humans.

Longhaired cat breeds such as Persians and Himalayans may have a predisposition to skin fungal infections.

122,Skin Disease Due to Food Allergies in Cats,"Dermatologic Food Reactions in Cats

 

While the pathogenesis of dermatologic food reactions is not fully understood, immediate reactions and delayed reactions to food are thought to be due to a hypersensitive immune response. Dermatologic food reactions are non-seasonal reactions which occur following ingestion of one or more allergy causing substances in an animal’s food. The physical reaction is frequently excessive itchiness, with resultant excessive scratching at the skin. 

 

On the other hand, food intolerance is a non-immunologic idiosyncratic reaction due to the metabolic, toxic or pharmacologic effects of the offending ingredients. Since it is not easy to distinguish between immunologic and idiosyncratic reactions, any negative response to food is generally referred to as an adverse food reaction.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Non-seasonal itchiness of any body location 
	Poor response to anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoids suggests food hypersensitivity
	Vomiting 
	Diarrhea
	Excessive gut sounds, passing of gas, and frequent bowel movements 
	Malassezia dermatitis (fungal skin infections), pyoderma (bacterial skin infections), and otitis externa (inflammation of the outer ear) 
	Plaque – broad, raised flat areas on the skin
	Pustule – pus-containing raised skin inflammation 
	Erythema – redness of the skin 
	Crust – dried serum or pus on the surface of a ruptured blister or pustule 
	Scale – flakes or plates of dead skin 
	Self-induced baldness due to scratching
	Abrasion/sores on the skin due to scratching
	Leathery, thick, bark-like skin
	Hyperpigmentation – darkening of the skin
	Hives – swollen or inflamed bumps on the skin
	Giant wheals (elongated marks) on the skin
	Pyotraumatic dermatitis – bacterial infection of skin wounds due to scratching excessively                        


 

Causes

 


	Immune-mediated reactions – result of the ingestion and subsequent presentation of one or more glycoproteins (allergens) either before or after digestion; sensitization may occur as the food passes into the intestine, after the substance is absorbed, or both
	Non-immune (food intolerance) reactions – resulting from ingestion of foods with high levels of histamine (an antigen known to cause immune hypersensitivity) or substances that induce histamine either directly or through histamine-releasing factors
	It is speculated that in juvenile animals intestinal parasites or intestinal infections may cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, resulting in the abnormal absorption of allergens and subsequent sensitization to some ingredients


 





Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a dermatological exam. Non-food causes of dermatologic disease should be ruled out. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other causes of disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, especially regarding any changes in diet, and any new foods added to your cat's diet, even if temporary. 

 

Food elimination diets are advised for cats thought to be suffering from adverse food reactions. These diets typically include one protein source and one carbohydrate source to which the cat has had limited or no previous exposure to. A clinical improvement may be seen as soon as four weeks into the new diet, and maximum alleviation of clinical signs may be seen as late as thirteen weeks into the food elimination diet. 

 

There are two things to keep in mind when undertaking the elimination diet with your cat: cats require a source for taurine in their diets or they will become quickly and extremely ill and die. Your cat will ingest sufficient quantities of taurine as long as it is being fed meat; and, cats do not naturally have the digestive capabilities to handle a large amount of carbohydrates, so the protein in their diet should outweigh the carbohydrate by about 90 percent. Choose a protein source that is high in taurine, such as meat, chicken, or fish. Avoid raw meats, as they can be a source of other bacteria, such as salmonella. Some suggested animal meats that may be fed to your cat are organ meats such as the liver, heart, etc.

 

If your cat improves on the elimination diet, a challenge should be performed to confirm that the original diet was the cause of disease and to determine what ingredient in the original diet triggered the adverse reaction. 

 

Challenge: feed your cat with the original diet. A return of the signs confirms that something in the diet is causing the signs. The challenge period should last until the signs return but no longer than ten days. 

 

If the challenge confirms the presence of an adverse food reaction, the next step is to perform a provocation diet trial: going back to the elimination diet, begin by adding a single ingredient at a time to the diet. After waiting a sufficient amount of time for the ingredient to prove either agreeable or adverse, if there is no physical reaction, move on to adding the next ingredient to your cat's diet, again, keeping in mind that your cat need always have a source of taurine in its diet. The provocation period for each new ingredient should last up to ten days, less if signs develop sooner. Should symptoms of an adverse reaction develop, discontinue the last added ingredient and wait for the symptoms to subside before moving forward to the next ingredient.

 

The test ingredients for the provocation trials should include a full range of meats (beef, chicken, fish, pork, and lamb), a minimal but full range of grains (corn, wheat, soybean, and rice), eggs, and dairy products. The results of these trials will guide your selection of commercial foods, based on those prepared foods that do not contain the offending substance(s). 

 

Treatment

 

Avoid any food substances that caused the clinical signs to return during the provocation phase of the diagnosis. Antibiotics or antifungal medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian if secondary pyodermas or Malassezia infections occur. 

 

Living and Management

 

Treats, chewable toys, vitamins, and other chewable medications (e.g., heartworm preventive) that may contain ingredients from your cat's previous diet must be eliminated. Make sure to read all ingredient labels carefully. If your cat spends time outdoors you will need to create a confined area to prevent foraging and hunting, or you may need to consider keeping your cat indoors, at least during the trial period. All family members will need to be made aware of the test protocol and must help keep the test diet clean and free of any other food sources. Cooperation is essential to the successful treatment of this disorder."," and Types

123,Skin Disease (Dermatophilosis) in Cats,"Dermatophilosis in Cats

Dermatophilosis is a skin disease most prevalent in warm, wet, or humid climates. This condition is rare in cats, but when it does occur, the chances of contraction are higher in cats with wet skin, or that have skin that is compromised from parasitic bites, such as from fleas or ticks, or other types of wounds. As noted, wet skin, and wet scabs, are more prone to infection, since moisture encourages the germination of zoospores and the spread of hyphae, a fungal cell, throughout the body. Humidity plays a part in increased infection rates by creating an environment for parasitic insects to breed, which in turn leave the host's (in this case, your cat's) skin open to infection.
 
Symptoms and Types

If you see pus filled bumps, abscesses, or crusted scabs, either in the mouth or under the skin, and there is no apparent cause for them, it might be a case of dermatophilosis. This is especially so if your cat has been in an environment with cattle, sheep or horses (or has been around people or animals that have been in such an environment). If you suspect this is the condition, and the bumps resemble those described above, you should consult your veterinarian for advice on treatment.

Diagnosis

These bacteria are easy to recognize on sight because of their described “railroad track” appearance (also described as paint brush lines).Your veterinarian will take samples of the pus and crusted skin to analyze them for dermatophilosis bacteria.  If there is pus under the crusts, it will also be examined. Once tests determine that the dermatophilosis bacteria are present, treatment will be prescribed.

Be sure to tell your veterinarian if your cat has been near farm animals or has been in an environment where there are farm animals. This information will help in determining whether the infection is dermatophilosis. A biopsy of the ulcers, and samples of the pus, will be taken from draining ulcers, if they are present.

Once tests determine that the dermatophilosis bacteria are present, treatment will be prescribed. If dermatophilosis is ruled out, further tests will be ordered to determine exactly what is causing this skin disorder.

  

Treatment

Antibacterial shampoo will be used to cleanse the skin and hair, followed by the gentle removal of infected flesh or abscesses. One or two baths will usually be enough to begin resolving the condition. Consult your veterinarian as to which shampoo you should use.

Following the cleaning, your veterinarian may also prescribe antibiotics to be taken for 10 to 20 days, especially if the infection has become severe. The antibiotic most commonly used is penicillin, however, the following are also used, depending on the circumstance: tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin.

Your veterinarian will want to see your cat again after two to three weeks, to be certain that the condition has been resolved. If the results are negative, another seven days of therapy may be prescribed.
 
Prevention

It is possible, though unlikely, that humans can become infected after having contact with an infected cat. If any of the members of your household have compromised immune systems, it is advised that your cat be kept isolated from such persons until the condition has cleared."," and Types

124,"Skin Disease, Autoimmune (Pemphigus) in Cats","Pemphigus in Cats



Pemphigus is a general designation for a group of autoimmune skin diseases involving ulceration and crusting of the skin, as well as the formation of fluid-filled sacs and cysts (vesicles), and pus filled lesions (pustules). Some types of pemphigus can also affect the skin tissue of the gums. An autoimmune disease is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies: antibodies that are produced by the system, but which act against the body's healthy cells and tissues – just as white blood cells act against infection. In effect, the body is attacking itself. The severity of the disease depends on how deeply the autoantibody deposits into the skin layers.



The hallmark sign of pemphigus is a condition called acantholysis, where the skin cells separate and break down because of tissue-bound antibody deposits in the space between cells. There are three types of pemphigus that affect cats: pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus erythematosus, and pemphigus vulgaris.



In the disease pemphigus foliaceus, the autoantibodies are deposited in the outermost layers of the epidermis, and blisters form on otherwise healthy skin. Pemphigus erythematosus is fairly common, and is a lot like pemphigus foliaceus, but less afflictive. Pemphigus vulgaris, on the other hand, has deeper, and more severe ulcers, because the autoantibody is deposited deep in the skin.



Symptoms and Types



Foliaceus


	Scales, crust, pustules, shallow ulcers, redness, and itching of the skin
	Footpad overgrowth and cracking
	Occasional vesicles: fluid-filled sacs/cysts in the skin
	The head, ears, and footpads are the most commonly affected; this often becomes generalized over the body
	Gums and lips may be affected
	It is common for the nipples and nail beds to be affected in cats
	Swollen lymph nodes, generalized swelling, depression, fever, and lameness (if footpads are involved); however, patients are often in otherwise good health
	Variable pain and itchy skin
	Secondary bacterial infection is possible because of cracked or ulcerated skin


 Erythematosus 


	Mainly the same as for pemphigus foliaceus
	Lesions are usually confined to the head, face, and footpads
	Loss of color in lips is more common than with other pemphigus forms


 Vulgaris 


	The most serious of the pemphigus types
	More severe than pemphigus foliaceus and erythematosus
	Ulcers, both shallow and deep, blisters, crusted skin
	Affects gums, lips, and skin; may become generalized over the body
	Mouth ulcers are frequent, may result in loss of appetite
	The underarm and groin areas are often involved
	Itchy skin and pain
	Anorexia, depression, fever
	Secondary bacterial infections are common




Causes




	Autoantibodies: the body creates antibodies that react to healthy tissue and cells as though they are pathogenic (diseased)
	Excessive sun exposure
	Certain breeds appear to have a hereditary predisposition






Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Patients with pemphigus will often have normal bloodwork results. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.



A skin exam is crucial. A skin tissue sample will be taken for examination (biopsy); and pustule and crust aspirates (fluid) will be wiped onto a slide to diagnose pemphigus. A positive diagnosis is achieved when acantholytic cells (i.e., separated cells) and neutrophils (white blood cells) are found. A bacterial culture of the skin may be used for identification and treatment of any secondary bacterial infections, and antibiotics will be prescribed in the event that there is a secondary infection present.





Treatment



Only severely affected patients need to be hospitalized for supportive care. Steroid therapy may be prescribed briefly to bring the condition under control. If corticosteroid and azathioprine therapy is prescribed, your cat will be switched to a low-fat diet, since these medications can dispose animals to pancreatitis. Your veterinarian will treat your cat with the drugs that are specifically suited to the form of pemphigus it has.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to see your cat every one to three weeks. Standard blood-work will be performed at each visit to check for progress. Once your cat's condition has gone into remission, it may be seen once every one to three months. The sun can worsen this condition, so it is important to protect your cat from excessive exposure to the sun."," and Types

125,Skin Cancer (Mucocutaneous Plasmacytoma) in Cats,"Mucocutaneous Plasmacytoma
 
A mucocutaneous plasmacytoma is a rapidly developing skin tumor of plasma cells origin. This type of tumor is rare in cats, but is most often found in the on the trunk and legs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
In addition to being found on the trunk and legs, mucocutaneous plasmacytomas may develop on the mouth, feet, and ears (lip tumors are particularly small and often overlooked). These tumors are generally solitary, solid nodules, either raised or ulcerated.
 
Causes
 
The underlying cause for the development of these tumors has yet to be identified.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which should be normal, unless some concurrent disease is also present. The most popular diagnostic procedure is to aspirate a nodule and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further testing. If abnormal tumor cells are identified, your cat may be suffering from mucocutaneous plasmacytoma(s).


 


Treatment
 
If the tumor has become invasive, surgery is typically recommended to excise the tumor and surrounding tissue. Radiotherapy is also conducted in some cats in order to destroy the neoplastic tissue.
 
Living and Management
 
Fortunately, most cats respond well to surgery and radiotherapy, and overall prognosis is excellent with treatment."," and Types

What Is Skin Cancer in Cats?
Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the skin. Cancerous cells divide and grow without following the body’s instructions, which often leads to formation of a mass, or tumor. With skin cancer, there is usually an abnormality like a lump, bump, or oozing lesion. Skin cancer in cats is most often found on the head, neck, trunk, or legs.

A cancer can be benign, meaning it grows slowly and does not spread, or malignant, meaning it grows quickly and spreads. Malignant skin cancers can be very aggressive locally, meaning that they grow and spread rapidly in the region in which they are found. It is also possible for them to spread to other sites, such as the lymph nodes.

It is difficult to diagnose cancer based on appearance alone. To determine if a tumor is malignant or benign, cells must be taken and examined under the microscope. Testing can help give you more information regarding the type of cancer and expectations for what will happen next.

Types of Skin Cancer in Cats

While there are many different types of skin cancer in cats, the four most common are basal cell tumors, mast cell tumors, squamous cell carcinoma, and fibrosarcoma.

Basal cell tumors

Basal cell tumors occur in what’s called the basal layer of the skin. They lay on the bottom or base of the epidermis—the outermost layer. These tumors are usually firm and easy to grab and move around with your fingers. They are more common in senior cats, with Persians and Himalayans being more prone to this tumor type.

Basal cell tumors most commonly occur on the head, neck, and shoulders, but can be found anywhere on the body. They vary in size, are often hairless, and can be pigmented. Fortunately, basal cell tumors are benign and do not spread. Surgical removal is generally successful.

Mast cell tumors

Mast cell tumors most commonly occur on the head, neck, and legs, with over half of them occurring on the head. They are more common in middle-aged cats, with Siamese cats at a higher risk of developing this tumor type.

Mast cell tumors are often raised pink masses that are well-circumscribed so that you can move them around with your fingers. Cats can also have multiple mast cell tumors at once, and if that occurs there is associated with a poorer prognosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma

Squamous cell carcinomas may initially look like scabs or thickened skin, and often progress to oozing, bloody, ulcerated skin. This cancer type is more common on light-colored skin, with lesions more frequently occurring on the face, nose, and ears of white-faced cats. It is more prevalent in cats that spend a great deal of time outdoors, as sun exposure is linked to an increased risk of developing this type of cancer.

This tumor type may be itchy and lead to skin irritation. Many affected cats will want to scratch and rub the lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma is locally aggressive and can spread rapidly across the affected skin, making it difficult to remove all the cancerous tissue.

Fibrosarcoma

Fibrosarcomas are tumors of the connective tissue. Because there is connective tissue throughout the body, these tumors can be found anywhere. They are more likely in places where cats have had injections in the past, like vaccinations or other fluids and medications. The most common sites are between the shoulder blades and on the trunk near the hind legs.

A fibrosarcoma is typically a very firm mass that is well-connected to the underlying tissue. While most of these tumors are more locally aggressive, growing rapidly at their original site, about a quarter will metastasize or spread to other sites. The size and rate of growth are correlative with how dangerous the cancer is, with larger and more rapidly growing fibrosarcomas being associated with shorter survival times than slower-growing masses.

Surgery is recommended for treatment of this skin cancer type. However, many fibrosarcomas are difficult to remove.

Symptoms of Skin Cancer in Cats
Skin cancer can present in different ways depending on the type of cancer. The following are more common clinical signs of skin cancer in cats:


	
	Lump or bump (raised area) 
	
	
	Ulcerated, bleeding, weeping, or oozing lesion
	
	
	Pigmented or discolored region
	
	
	Scaling patch
	
	
	Scabbing of the ears or nose
	
	
	Red, flat plaque
	
	
	Non-healing wound
	


Causes of Skin Cancer in Cats
Generally speaking, cancer is caused by a combination of genetics, environmental exposure, and chronic irritation or stimulation of the skin. The most common factors that increase a cat’s risk for developing skin cancer are:


	
	Sun exposure—This is an especially heightened risk factor for light-furred or hairless cats, which have less natural protection from UV rays.
	
	
	Genetics—Many breeds are predisposed to, or more likely to develop, certain types of cancer due to carrying linked genes. Persians and Himalayans are more prone to developing basal cell tumors, while Siamese cats are more likely to develop mast cell tumors.
	
	
	Chronic skin irritation—Cats with underlying skin allergies or compulsive licking behaviors may develop chronic irritation and stimulation of their skin from licking, chewing, and scratching.
	
	
	Physical trauma—Any physical trauma that disrupts the skin cells and leads to scar formation can increase a cat’s risk of developing skin cancer in the area.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Skin Cancer in Cats
If you suspect your cat may have skin cancer, make an appointment with your veterinarian. The exam will start with a close look at your cat’s skin, and the vet may decide to do a test called cytology, where cells are collected to be examined under a microscope. This may be done with a needle (most common in lumps and bumps) or by making an impression with a glass slide. Sometimes this is enough to confirm the type of cancer.

Certain tumors, like mast cell tumors, are recognizable under the microscope. But often, more information is needed to confirm a diagnosis. Your veterinarian is likely to recommend a biopsy, where a piece or all the abnormal tissue is removed and sent off to a laboratory for a veterinary pathologist to determine the disease process.

If metastases are suspected, your veterinarian may recommend x-rays or lymph node cytology to determine whether cancer has spread to distant sites.

Treatment of Skin Cancer in Cats
Most skin cancers in cats are managed surgically, with the tumor itself being removed. Your veterinarian will likely recommend sending the tissue off for histopathology, a process where abnormal tissue (skin or mass) is removed and sent to a lab. This allows the doctor to better determine what is causing the abnormal growth.

Sometimes surgery is not possible—when the tumor is too large to be removed, or when the patient is not a good candidate for anesthesia. For these patients, your veterinarian may recommend watchful waiting or a less invasive cancer treatment, including radiation and chemotherapy.

Recovery and Management of Skin Cancer in Cats
Recovery times vary depending on the type of skin cancer a cat is diagnosed with. Benign lesions, like basal cell tumors, are associated with a good prognosis. With these tumors, surgical removal is generally considered curative, and recovery is limited to 2 weeks following surgery for the incision to heal. Other cancers, like squamous cell carcinoma and fibrosarcoma, may have more prolonged treatment courses, with a decreased prognosis for complete recovery.

Pathology tests may give you more answers regarding survival times for the specific cancer type your cat was diagnosed with. If surgery is performed to manage skin cancer, expect to keep your cat calm and quiet for two weeks after, while the skin is healing. Keep the incision clean and dry and ensure your cat is unable to lick or chew at the incision site. Sometimes Elizabethan collars or recovery cones are required to keep your cat from licking or chewing on the incision.

Some tumor types, like mast cell tumors, may return later. It’s important to keep up with annual check-up appointments for your cat’s health and to note any new or returning tumors.

Prevention of Skin Cancer in Cats

Genetics plays a large role in whether a cat develops skin cancer, but there are some things you can do to decrease the risk. Limiting direct sun exposure when UV intensity is at its peak, especially in white-faced cats, can reduce the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.

There are commercially available sunscreen products safe for cats if limiting exposure is not possible. Cats that are hairless, like the Sphinx breed, or very light-colored, may benefit from this extra layer of protection.

127,Skin Cancer (Hemangiosarcoma) in Cats,"Hemangiosarcoma of the Skin in Cats
 
The endothelial cells make up the layer of cells collectively referred to as the endothelium, which lines the inner surface of blood vessels, including, but not limited to, the veins, arteries, and intestines. These cells are responsible for the smooth flow of blood within the lumen (interior space) of all of the body's inner structures and tubular spaces. A hemangiosarcoma of the skin is a malignant tumor which arises from the endothelial cells. As the endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system, a hemangiosarcoma can occur at any point in the body.
 
Because this type of sarcoma grows from the blood cells, the growths themselves are filled with blood. This accounts for the dark blue or red coloring of the mass. If the growth is limited to the outer layer of skin, where it can be removed entirely, the prognosis may be guardedly optimistic, but because of the highly metastatic nature of this cancer, it is sometimes found to reach deep into the tissue, or to have arisen from a deeper, visceral location. In the latter case, the outcome is often fatal.
 
This type of cancer can affect any breed of cat at any age, but the incidence of this type of cancer remains relatively rare in cats. Moreover, it is thought to affect cats with lighter skin or hair that spend excessive amounts of time in the sun.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
These masses are most commonly present on the cat’s hind limbs, prepuce, and ventral abdomen, but may appear at any place on the body. The tumors may also change in size due to bleeding inside the growth. The following are symptoms related to hermangiosarcoma in cats:
 

    Solitary mass or multiple masses on the skin
    Nodules on skin are raised, firm, and dark
    Nodules are usually not ulcerative
    In subcutaneous tissue, masses are firm but soft, and fluctuate underneath
    Bruising appearance may be present on masses

 
Causes
 
Although the cause of hemangiosarcoma of the skin is unknown, it is known that light colored and short coated cats are more predisposed to skin cancer than others.  
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible factors that might have led to this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms, including any details you have about your cat's breed and familial background, the types of activities your cat takes part in, and any physical or behavioral changes that might have taken place recently. 
 
Routine laboratory tests will include a chemical blood profile and complete blood count. The results of these tests are usually normal but may show an abnormally low number of platelets (cells involved in blood clotting). Abdominal and thoracic X-rays will be taken to determine how invasive the hemangiosarcoma is, whether there is metastasis in the lungs or any other internal organs. In some cases, the tumor may even reach to the bone. Computer tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be used to view the extent of the disease and in planning the surgery.
 
A skin biopsy remains the method of choice for confirmation of diagnosis. Your veterinarian will take a sample of tissue from the mass to have it microscopically examined by a veterinary oncologist. 
 


Treatment
 
The most successful outcome will require surgical removal in combination with chemical therapy. A wide surgical excision of the tumor, along with some of the normal skin tissue surrounding it is typically the most effective treatment. However, if the tumor involves subcutaneous tissue, complete removal may be difficult to achieve.
 
After the initial surgery, your veterinary oncologist may recommend continued radiation therapy, especially if a complete resection of tumor could not be achieved. Chemotherapy may also be an option, but whether it is used or not will be decided by your veterinary oncologist.
 
Living and Management
 
As with other malignant tumors, cats affected with this tumor have a limited lifespan after diagnosis. Surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy may prolong your cat's lifespan, but not significantly. Cats that have been diagnosed and treated for cancer need to be fed a diet that is specifically formulated for them. Your veterinarian will help you to plan a diet for your cat posttreatment.
 
Postoperative pain is common, and your veterinarian will recommend pain relieving medications for your cat. Do not use any pain medications without his or hers prior approval, since there are some pain killers that may aggravate the bleeding problems in affected cats. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is an overdose of medication.
 
After surgery, you should expect the cat to feel sore. The veterinarian will give you pain medication to minimize your cat's discomfort. You will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally without unduly exertion. You will also need to protect your cat from the harmful effects of sunlight. If your cat spends time on a window sill or at a glass door, a transparent ultraviolet (UV) blocking window cover can be used to limit the amount of UV rays that reach your cat.
 
Each cat is different, and some will survive longer than others. The location and extent of the tumor will determine the prognosis, but the average time of survival after surgery is often less than one year. Moreover, complete and permanent remission is rare."," and Types

128,Skin Cancer (Epidermotropic Lymphoma) in Cats,"Epidermotropic Lymphoma in Cats
 
Epidermotropic Lymphoma is a malignant tumor affecting the skin of cats and considered a subset of cutaneous (skin) T-cell lymphoma. Like other forms lymphoma, this cancer originates in the lymphocyte cells of the immune system. A type of white blood cell, lymphocytes play an integral role in the body’s defenses and are mainly seen in two forms: B-cells and T-cells.
 
Cats of all ages and breeds are susceptible to this cancer, though it usually affects older animals.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Itching
    Loss of hair (alopecia)
    Scaly skin
    Redness of skin
    Lightening of skin color or loss of pigment (depigmentation)
    Skin ulcers, nodule or mass formation (lesions may involve lips, eyelids, nasal surface, vulva, oral cavity)

 
Causes
 
The exact cause of this form of skin cancer is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count  -- the results of which are typically found to be variable, depending on the stage of the disease. Radiographic studies are used in advanced stages of the disease to confirm advanced tumor stage.
 
Often, a skin biopsy helps in making a definitive diagnosis. This is accomplished by removing a small piece of skin lesion, which is then sent to a veterinary pathologist.





Treatment
 
Because a “cure” is thought to be highly unlikely for cats with epidermotropic lymphoma, providing an adequate quality of life remains the major goal of therapy. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used to treat the disease, but are highly variable in their efficacy. The veterinarian may also recommend surgically excising isolated nodules.
 
Living and Management
 
Follow guidelines for using chemotherapy medication at your home, as these drugs are toxic to humans. They should only be used after seeking advice from a veterinary oncologist.
 
Unfortunately, overall prognosis is very poor in cats affected by this form of lymphoma. Only a few cats may live longer than two years after the diagnosis, and often they are euthanized."," and Types

129,Skin Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Sweat Gland, Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Cats
 
While skin tumors are most common on the face, they can occur anywhere a cat has sweat glands. Adenocarcinoma is a glandular skin cancer that occurs when a malignant growth develops from sebaceous glands and sweat glands. Skin cancer appears as solid, firm or raised areas (lesions) on the skin. The lesions can bleed (ulcerate) and the area may swell or become red. Treatment options are generally effective when started early and in many cases leads to a positive outcome.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Lesions can be present on the body of the cat as a single lesion or in many different areas. Skin cancer can appear as a solid, firm mass, or a raised lesion on the skin.
 
Causes
 
The cause of skin cancer is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
For a proper diagnosis to be made, a biopsy will be necessary. Your veterinarian will take a tissue sample of the tumor to evaluate under a microscope, and will more than likely be performing a  cytologic examination of the structure of the cells from the sample to determine whether the disease has spread throughout the body, and the speed at which it is metastasizing (spreading). An X-ray may also be used to determine if internal tumors are present.
 
 
 
Treatment
 
Surgical removal of the tumor is the most common course of treatment. Affected lymph nodes may also need to be drained and treated to prevent rupture and infection. Radiation therapy can then be used to treat the lymph nodes to prevent recurrence and metastasis of the disease into other areas. Chemotherapy drugs are also used to treat tumors. The degree of treatment is determined by the severity the disease.
 
Living and Management
 
The long-term prognosis for cats is often good when the cancer is treated early and aggressively. Aggressive treatment often involves surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.
 
Prevention
 
There is currently no way to prevent skin cancer."," and Types
 
Lesions can be present on the body of the cat as a single lesion or in many different areas. Skin cancer can appear as a solid, firm mass, or a raised lesion on the skin.

130,Skin Bumps (Papulonodular Dermatoses) Cats,"Papulonodular Dermatoses in Cats



Bumps that are found on the surface of the skin, and which have a solid appearance without liquid or pus within (nonsupperative), are medically termed papulonodular dermatoses. These bumps are classified as either papules or nodules. 



Symptoms and Types



Papules are the result of tissue infiltration by inflammatory cells. While nodules, which are larger than papules, are the result of a massive infiltration of inflammatory or cancerous cells into the layers of the skin.



These papules and/or nodules are essentially raised bumps on the surface of the skin - papules and/or nodules on the skin



Causes




	Superficial and deep bacterial infection of the hair follicles
	Fungal infection of the hair follicles with a secondary bacterial infection; may include raised, pus-filled, spongy lesions
	Ringworm
	Sebaceous (oil) gland inflammation
	Acne
	Mange
	Nematode infection
	Bodily cells crowding into the skin  (eosinophils, white blood cells that eat bacteria, fight parasites or macrophages)
	Reaction to sunlight
	Neoplasia (abnormal tissue growth)




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as an excessive amount of time in the sun, new foods that might have cause allergic responses, recent infections with parasites, etc.



Standard tests will include a complete blood profile a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. During the physical exam, your veterinarian will scrape your cat's skin gently with a scalpel in order to get samples of the hair and skin for testing. This will allow your veterinarian to check for parasites, bacteria and/or yeast infections, any of which may be causing the skin to react with the raised nodules and papules. Cultures of these samples will be sent to a laboratory to check for fungi, bacteria, and microscopic parasites. Skin samples will also be sent for analysis on a microscopic level.







Treatment



The medicines prescribed will depend on what the underlying cause of your cat's skin disease is. Your veterinarian may prescribe oral or topical (or both) antibiotics if bacteria are present. If your cat has parasites, it will need to be bathed in a parasiticidal dip (a preparation that is used to destroy parasites).



If your cat is having a reaction to sunlight, you will need to limit your cat's exposure to sunshine between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., or apply sun block that is safe for use on cats. If your cat often spends time near a sunny window, you might consider placing light filtering shades over the glass to block ultraviolet (UV) rays.



For cases of squamous cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, the long-term outlook is poor. If your cat is a good candidate for surgery, your veterinarian will counsel you on your options. Often, surgery in conjunction with other cancer eradicating therapies is necessary.



Living and Management



You will need to revisit your veterinarian as often as recommended for chemical blood profiles, complete blood counts (CBC), urinalyses, and electrolyte panels if your cat is receiving cyclosporine, retinoid therapy or synthetic retinoid therapy.



Cats with mange should be monitored until they show no more signs of the infection, while those with ringworm will need to have fungal cultures repeated until they have a clear return.

Sterile nodular/granulomatous dermatoses are diseases in which the primary lesions or masses of tissue, are solid, elevated, and greater than one centimeter in diameter. These nodules are usually the result of an infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin and be a reaction to interal or external stimuli.

Symptoms and Types


    Nodular 	dermatofibrosis
    Calcinosis 	circumscripta
    Malignant 	histiocytosis


Causes


    Amyloidosis 	(a waxy protein deposit, or amyloid, in the body)
    Reaction 	to foreign body
    Spherulocytosis 	(disease of red blood cells)
    Idiopathic 	sterile granuloma and pyogranuloma
    Calcinosis 	circumscripta (skin stones, similar to calcinosis cutis)
    Malignant 	histiocytosis (abnormally spreading immune-type cells)
    Cutaneous 	histiocytosis (immune-type cells spreading to skin)
    Sterile 	panniculitis (inflammation of the skin)
    Nodular 	dermatofibrosis (bumps filled with excess elastic skin material 	which accompanies kidney disease)
    Cutaneous 	xanthoma (a benign skin problem, involving immune cell infiltration 	usually accompanies hyperlipoproteinemia or diabetes mellitus)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.

The physical exam should include a dermatologic exam, during which skin biopsies for histopathology can be taken to determine if structural changes have occurred in the tissue.  Skin scrapings will also be examined microscopically and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi.



Treatment

Most of these skin disorders can be treated on an outpatient basis, unless they have reached a severe stage. A few of these disorders, such as malignant histiocytosis, amyloidosis, and nodular dermatofibrosis, are almost always fatal.  Cats with calcinosis cutis may need to be hospitalized for sepsis and intense topical therapy.

Some of the other forms of dermatoses with nodules or granulomas are discussed below:


    Amyloidosis: 	no known therapy, unless the lesion is solitary and can be 	surgically removed
    Spherulocytosis: 	the only effective treatment is surgical removal
    Foreign 	body reactions are best treated by removal of the offending 	substance if possible
    For 	hair foreign bodies, the cat should be placed on softer bedding and 	topical therapy with keratolytic agents should be initiated. Many 	cats with hair foreign bodies also have secondary deep bacterial 	infections that need to be treated with both topical and systemic 	antibiotics
    Malignant 	histiocytosis: no effective therapy. It is rapidly fatal
    Calcinosis 	cutis: underlying disease must be controlled if possible.  Most 	cases require antibiotics to control secondary bacterial infections. 	Hydrotherapy and frequent bathing in antibacterial shampoos minimize 	secondary problems. If lesions are extensive, serum calcium levels 	should be monitored closely
    Calcinosis 	circumscripta: surgical excision is the therapy of choice in most 	cases
    Sterile 	panniculitis: single lesions can be removed surgically
    Nodular 	dermatofibrosis: no therapy for most cases, because the 	cystadenocarcinomas are usually bilateral
    For 	the rare unilateral case of cystadenocarcinoma or a cystadenoma, 	removal of the single affected kidney may be helpful
    Cutaneous 	xanthoma: correction of the underlying diabetes mellitus or 	hyperlipoproteinemia is usually curative


Living and Management

Your veterinarian will prescribe medication dependent upon your cat's diagnosis and condition. Bloodwork and a urinalysis will need to be performed every six months if your cat is taking long-term glucocorticoids. If your cat is taking dimethylsulfoxide for calcinosis cutis, bloodwork should be performed every 1-2 weeks to monitor calcium levels until they are regulated."," and Types

A pustule is also a small, defined elevation of the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) that is filled with pus – a mixture of white blood cells, cellular debris, dead tissue, and serum, the clear watery fluid that separates from the blood. A vesicle, or blister, is a small, defined elevation of the outer layer of the skin (known as the epidermis) that is filled only with with serum.



Vesiculo- refers to vesicles; this prefixed form is attached to the diseased condition that is concurrent with the cause of the blister.



Pustular refers to an organism that is covered in pustules.



Dermatoses is the plural form of dermatosis, which is used to describe any abnormality or disorder of the skin.



Symptoms and Types



One or more of the following signs may be present:




	Hair loss
	Reddened skin
	Vesicles or blisters: small elevations of the outer layer of the skin filled with clear fluid
	Pustules: small elevations of the outer layer of the skin filled with pus

Causes



Vesicles


	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks its own skin and possibly other organs)
	Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE; an autoimmune disease involving the skin only, usually the face)
	Bullous pemphigoid (an autoimmune disease with ulceration of the skin and/or moist tissues of the body)
	Pemphigus vulgaris (severe autoimmune disease with ulceration of the mouth, and in the junction between the moist tissues and skin)




Pustules

133,Skin and Toe Cancer (Melanocytic) in Cats,"Melanocytic Tumors of the Skin and Digits in Cats
 
Melanocytic tumors are benign or cancerous growths, arising from melanocytes (pigment-producing skin cells) and melanoblasts (melanin-producing cells that develop or mature into melanocytes). These tumors do not seem to have a genetic basis; however, cat ages 8 to 14 seem to have a predilection to the condition.
 
In addition, melanocytic tumors can be found in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Melanocytic tumors may develop anywhere on a cat's body, though it is more common on the head, toes (digits), ear, and nose. Depending on the location of the lesion, they may be pigmented or non-pigmented. Additionally, lymph nodes near the affected area may become enlarged.
 
These masses may develop slowly or rapidly, but in advance stages of the disease, the cat may have trouble breathing or make harsh lung sounds due to the spread of the cancer into the lungs. Furthermore, if the masses have spread to a limb, the cat may appear lame or have difficulty walking.

Causes
 
The cause of melanocytic tumors in cats is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
Cell examination and special stains may distinguish amelanotic melanoma from poorly differentiated mast cell tumors, lymphoma, and carcinoma. Your veterinarian may also X-ray the affected area to determine if the underlying bone has been compromised, especially if the growth is one a toe (or digit).

 


Treatment
 
Depending on the severity and location of the tumor, your veterinarian may need to surgically remove it. He or she may also recommend chemotherapy if surgical removal is incomplete or if the cancer has spread to other vital organs.
 
Living and Management
 
Because early detection of recurrence is crucial, your veterinarian will recommend regular followup exams subsequent to the surgery (every three months for 24 months). However, it is important that you bring the cat back to veterinarian immediately if you suspect the mass has returned."," and Types

134,Sinus Infections in Cats,"What Is a Sinus Infection in Cats?
Sinuses are air-filled sacs within the skull and the nasal cavity that are interconnected. They are lined with mucus membranes that filter out germs, pollens, dust, and debris. Any obstruction or destruction of the membranes can cause those irritants to remain in place, leading to a sinus infection.

 Just like in humans, sinus infections are debilitating and can cause pain, fever, lethargy, and a diminished sense of smell. They can also cause a temporary loss of appetite, as the sense of smell in cats is more of a driving force for eating than their sense of taste.

Sinusitis is termed an “inflammation of the sinus” lining, and rhinitis is termed an “inflammation of the nasal passages.”  Both often occur simultaneously and are common complications of upper respiratory tract disorders in cats.

Symptoms of Sinus Infection in Cats
Cats with sinus infections often have eye or nasal discharge or both, which can vary in consistency and color. They may sneeze, have a decreased appetite, and act withdrawn or lethargic.  Other symptoms accompanied with sinus infections can include:


	
	Labored breathing or a change in vocalization (meows may sound different)
	
	
	Nasal congestion
	
	
	Snoring
	
	
	Protrusion of the third eyelid, or cherry eye
	
	
	Conjunctivitis, or “red eye”
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Changes in behavior
	
	
	Swelling and/or asymmetry to the nose and face
	
	
	Difficulty swallowing or gagging
	
	
	Eye or mouth ulcers
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes beneath the jaw
	
	
	Reluctance to pet or touch the face and head
	
	
	Neurologic symptoms, such as seizures and head tilting
	


Causes of Sinus Infection in Cats
Kittens and immunocompromised cats are more at risk, but any age or breed of cat can develop a sinus infection. The causes are numerous, but most cases of sinus infections are considered infectious by nature. Causes can include:


	
	Infectious

	
		
		Viral
		
		
		Bacterial
		
		
		Fungal
		
		
		Nasal mites
		
	
	
	
	Allergic—an uncommon cause, which is usually seasonal due to high pollen counts, but can occur year-round if attributed to household dust and molds
	
	
	Dental disease such as tooth root abscess or oronasal fistula
	
	
	Nasopharyngeal polyps
	
	
	Foreign objects such as plant seeds or blades of grass
	
	
	Trauma
	
	
	Cancer (lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, more common in cats)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Sinus Infections in Cats
Since there are numerous causes for why a cat may have a sinus infection, diagnosing the underlying reason correctly is critical. The first thing your veterinarian may recommend after a physical exam is basic blood work, like a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, and retroviral testing (FeLV/FIV) to assess your cat’s overall health and provide possible therapy options. The results can also assist with surgical and anesthetic planning and help rule out other conditions.

From there, your veterinarian may then recommend a test that looks for trace DNA of infectious organisms; it is useful for screening and can provide future health implications if your cat is infected with feline herpesvirus. 

Radiographs or CT scans of the head and chest may be recommended to assess the nasal passages, sinuses, and lungs for potential masses or bony changes that can indicate chronic infection or cancer. Dental radiographs while under anesthesia may also be necessary to evaluate the extent of dental disease and tooth root abscess. 

Additionally, a rhinoscopy may be required. This is when a small camera is inserted inside the cat’s nose to visualize the nasal and sinus cavities. Biopsy samples can also be taken for further testing and analysis during this procedure.

Treatment of Sinus Infections in Cats
Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Antiviral medications such as famciclovir may be prescribed for cats with feline herpesvirus, and antibiotics such as Clavamox®, doxycycline, or clindamycin may be prescribed for bacterial infections. Fluconazole or itraconazole (antifungal medications) may be prescribed for fungal infections.

Although typically not given as a first line of defense, anti-inflammatories or steroids may also be needed to reduce swelling and mucus production—these can also be prescribed in cases of chronic sinusitis. 

Treatment options for cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination.  Nasopharyngeal polyps are surgically removed.

Cats with sinusitis due to an infected tooth generally require general anesthesia and a dental cleaning, with surgical extraction of the infected tooth. 

Secondary supportive care measures often include:


	Fluids given intravenously to combat dehydration
	Appetite stimulants such as Elura™ or mirtazapine to help with loss of appetite
	A temporary change in diet that may include warming the food first to make it more appetizing
	Wiping discharge from the eyes and nose
	At-home therapy may consist of steam therapy or using a nebulizer with saline. 


To prevent possible disease transmission, your cat may need to be isolated from any other cats in your home until the cause can be identified.

Recovery and Management of Sinus Infections in Cats
Cats with a favorable prognosis often respond to the above medications within a few days, with most treatment duration lasting two weeks. Some infections (such as fungal ones) can take months of treatment to show improvement.

Prevention of Sinus Infection in Cats
Not every sinus infection is preventable, but there are certain steps pet parents can take to minimize or reduce the chances of your cat getting one. Keeping your cat indoors reduces the risk of exposure to infectious organisms, and be sure to keep them up to date on vaccinations and routine veterinary check-ups. Avoid exposure to inhaled irritants and smoke, and improving the air quality of your home with regular household filters, as well as a clean environment, can lessen the risk overall.

A relatively stress-free lifestyle for your cat is also important, especially for those infected with herpesvirus, as it can reoccur and many cats will remain carriers for life. Cats with allergies can develop future infections—and getting a sinus infection once does not mean your cat will never get one again.
Sinus Infections in Cats FAQSIs there a home treatment for a sinus infection in cats?Many cats with sinus infections require multiple therapies to improve. You may be able to do some things at home to make them more comfortable, but it’s highly recommended to seek veterinary care at the first sign of an infection. Sinus infections, just like in humans, can be debilitating. If not treated appropriately, they can result in chronic pain.

Do not give your cat any human or over-the-counter products (such as Vicks VapoRub®) without consulting your veterinarian first. Many cats are sensitive to strong odors, and certain products are toxic to cats.
Is nasal dripping a sign of a sinus infection in cats?Yes, nasal discharge can be a sign of a sinus infection in cats. It is important that you seek veterinary attention immediately, so a proper diagnosis can be made, and an effective treatment is prescribed.

Causes of Sinus Infection in Cats
Kittens and immunocompromised cats are more at risk, but any age or breed of cat can develop a sinus infection. The causes are numerous, but most cases of sinus infections are considered infectious by nature. "
135,Signs of Stroke in Cats,"According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds,” and strokes are responsible for “1 out of every 20 deaths.” While strokes in cats are nowhere near that frequent, veterinarians are starting to realize that they do occur more often than we used to think, probably because more cats are now getting the diagnostic tests necessary to reach a diagnosis.

What is a Stroke?

The Dictionary of Veterinary Terms: Vet-speak Deciphered for the Non-Veterinarian defines stroke as “impairment of blood flow through blood vessels in the brain leading to destruction of brain tissue.” Two circumstances cause most strokes in cats:

1. A clot within a blood vessel in the brain. Blood clots can either form within the affected vessel (a thrombosis) or elsewhere in the body and then travel to and lodge in the vessel (an embolism). In either case, this type of stroke is referred to as an ischemic stroke.

2. Rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. This is called a hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding from the ruptured vessel results in blood pressing on and damaging nearby brain tissue.

Whatever type of stroke a cat has, the symptoms that develop are determined by how much brain tissue is affected, how severely it is affected, and where in the brain it is located. Possible signs of a stroke in cats include:


	Altered mental status
	Circling
	Weakness
	Head pressing (possibly as a result of a headache)
	Not using the legs normally (sometimes on one side of the body)
	Unsteadiness when walking
	A head tilt
	Abnormal eye movements
	Unequal pupil sizes
	Muscle spasms, including severe spasms that cause the head, neck, and body to arch backwards
	Seizures
	Coma
	Death


What sometimes will set a stroke apart from other conditions that can cause similar clinical signs is the fact that with a stroke, affected cats develop symptoms very quickly. They can essentially seem perfectly normal one minute and then be in big trouble the next.

In most cases, a cat’s symptoms don’t get significantly worse after the first 24 hours or so, unless a ruptured blood vessel continues to bleed.

What Causes Strokes in Cats?

While we think of strokes occurring primarily in older people, a small study published in 2011 showed that the median age for affected cats was around 9 years.

Several underlying health problems seem to increase the risk that a cat might have a stroke. Some that are more commonly cited include cancer within or spreading to the brain, heart disease, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, conditions that make the blood clot more easily, liver disease, diabetes, migrating parasites, lung disease, infections, and trauma. However, in many cases no cause for the stroke can be identified.

How Are Strokes Diagnosed in Cats?

When a veterinarian examines a cat who may have had a stroke, he or she will start by taking a thorough health history and asking questions about what symptoms you have seen at home, how quickly they developed, and if they have changed over time. A physical and neurological exam comes next, followed by any lab work (blood tests, urinalysis, fecal exam, blood pressure testing, etc.) that is necessary to rule out other diseases that might be to blame for or that are playing a role in your cat’s condition.

At this point, the veterinarian may have a fairly strong feeling that your cat has had a stroke, but more advanced testing is necessary if you need a definitive answer. Brain imaging (MRI’s or CT scans) can identify abnormalities within the brain. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid or a D-dimer blood test that looks for the breakdown of abnormal blood clots within the body can also be helpful.

How Are Cat Strokes Treated in Cats?

Treatments used to help cats after strokes are primarily symptomatic and supportive. For example,


	Oxygen therapy to improve oxygen delivery to damaged brain tissue and promote healing
	Seizure medications for cats to control seizures or reduce pressure within the skull, if necessary
	Management of any underlying conditions
	Maintaining hydration and adequate nutrition
	Help with urination, defecation, cleanliness, and comfort
	Physical therapy to address any persistent neurologic deficits


Determining whether to initiate or continue treatment after a cat has had a stroke can be difficult, but it is important to remember that recovery is possible and cats tend to look their worst in the first 24 hours after the stroke has occurred. It is generally thought that cats who have less severe symptoms and are otherwise relatively healthy are the best candidates for making a meaningful recovery. Unfortunately, research into what a cat’s prognosis really is after having a stroke simply hasn’t been done.

136,Side Effects of Medications for Anxiety in Cats,"Serotonin Syndrome in Cats

Anxiety disorders are common in indoor cats. Signs of anxiety include aggression, elimination outside of the litter box, excessive self-grooming, and hyperactivity. Drugs commonly used as antidepressants in humans are usually prescribed to treat feline anxiety issues. 

These medications affect the level of serotonin in the body. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter, a chemical that works in the brain, and is found in the nervous system. It regulates behavior, awareness of pain, appetite, movement, body temperature, and function of the heart and lungs.

If a cat is taking more than one type of medication that causes levels of serotonin to increase in the body, a condition known as serotonin syndrome (SS) can result, and if not caught in time, can lead to death.

Symptoms and Types

As seen in humans, serotonin syndrome may cause:


	Altered mental state (confusion, depression, or hyperactivity)
	Difficulty walking
	Trembling and seizures
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
	Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
	Increased body temperature (hyperthermia) 


Causes

Drugs prescribed as antidepressants in humans are becoming more common for use in animals. These medications alter the body’s levels of serotonin, and thus alter mood and behaviors. Some commonly used antidepressant drugs in cats include buspirone and fluoxetine.

Serotonin syndrome can be triggered when:


	Antidepressant drugs are given in excess
	Other drugs which affect serotonin levels are also ingested (e.g., amphetamines, chlorpheniramine, fentanyl, lithium, LSD)
	Certain foods are ingested along with medications (e.g., cheese, anything containing L-tryptophan)


Signs of serotonin syndrome usually come on rapidly; anywhere from 10 minutes to up to four hours after ingestion.  

Diagnosis 

Your veterinarian will conduct blood tests to figure out if your cat has an infection, as well as to determine what substances the cat might have eaten. Neurological testing (measuring reflexes and coordination) will be also performed to pinpoint a specific area of the nervous system that might be affected, like the brain or spinal cord. There is not a specific test that can be run to tell the veterinarian that serotonin syndrome is to blame. The history of drug ingestion and the signs your cat is showing should lead to the proper diagnosis.

Treatment

The treatment for serotonin syndrome is based on keeping the cat stable and sedate. If caught early enough (within 30 minutes), substances like activated charcoal may be given orally to try to reduce the amount of drug the cat can absorb into its system. If your cat is stable enough and it is caught early on, your cat may be made to vomit, or stomach pumping may be done to eliminate the drug from the body.

Signs of this condition will slowly diminish over 24 hours. During this time, your cat will need to be watched closely. Drugs may be given to counteract the serotonin in the body and reduce seizures if they are severe. All medications that are known to increase serotonin levels will be stopped, and supportive care (e.g., intravenous fluids) will be given. If treated quickly, this condition is less likely to cause death. 

Living and Management 

Care must be taken when giving an animal medications that are known to affect serotonin levels in the body. Do not give these medications along with foods that contain L-tryptophan (e.g., dairy products, turkey, red meats, bananas, peanut butter).

Prevention

Medications that will lead to increased levels of serotonin in the body should not be given to cats that are already taking an antidepressant medication. Your veterinarian should be aware of all medications being given and choose the drug combinations carefully.

137,Shoulder Joint Ligament and Tendon Conditions in Cats,"Bicipital Tenosynovitis, Brachii Muscle Rupture, and Supraspinatus Avulsion in Cats

 

A ligament is a band of connective or fibrous tissue that connects two bones or cartilage at a joint, and a tendon is a band of connective or fibrous tissue that connects a muscle to a bone. The shoulder joint is a “ball-and-socket” joint that is held together and supported by ligaments and tendons. In four legged animals, the shoulder is made up of the scapula/shoulder blade bones, and the humerus/upper bone of the front leg. Conditions that affect the tendons and ligaments of the shoulder will be apparent in a cat's ability to walk, run and jump.

 

Abnormalities of the ligaments and tendons in the shoulder are rare in cats, they are more commonly associated with large dogs and working dogs. However, there have been occasions in which shoulder disorders have been reported in cats. There is no prior indication that would necessarily dispose a cat to shoulder joint problems.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Symptoms will depend on the severity and long-term nature of the disease
	A decrease in muscle mass is a consistent finding for all conditions
	Bicipital tenosynovitis (an inflammation of the tendon and surrounding sheath of the biceps tendon – at the front of the shoulder blade)
	
		Onset is usually subtle
		Often of several months’ duration
		Trauma to the limb or shoulder may be the inciting cause
		Subtle, intermittent lameness that worsens with exercise
		Short and limited swing-phase of gait owing to pain on extension and flexion of the shoulder
		Pain inconsistently demonstrated on manipulation of shoulder
	
	
	Rupture of the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle (upper limb)
	
		Signs similar to bicipital tenosynovitis
		May have sudden (acute) onset due to a known traumatic event
		Usually subtle, long-term (chronic) lameness that worsens with exercise
		Mineralization of the tendon of the supraspinatus (shoulder joint) muscle — onset is usually subtle
		Long-term (chronic) lameness that worsens with activity
	
	
	Forcible separation (known as an avulsion) or fracture of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle (tendon that connects the scapula/bone of the shoulder blade with the humerus/bone of the upper limb)
	
		Signs are similar to mineralization of the supraspinatus tendon.
		Deterioration and scarring (known as fibrotic contracture) of the shoulder muscle — usually sudden (acute) onset, occurring during a period of intense outdoor exercise (such as hunting).
		Shoulder lameness and tenderness gradually disappears within two weeks
		Left untreated, condition results in long-term (chronic), persistent lameness
		Decrease in muscle mass of the infraspinatus muscle (muscle atrophy)
		When patient is walking, lower limb swings in an arc away from the body, as the paw is advanced
	
	


 

Causes

 


	Direct trauma to shoulder
	Repetitive strain injury (indirect trauma) is the most common cause
	Overexertion and/or fatigue
	Poor conditioning before performing athletic activities (i.e., lack of previous exercise, obesity, or inappropriate preparation)




  



Diagnosis

 

X-rays will be needed to determine what is wrong with the shoulder. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help identify muscle injuries, bicipital tenosynovitis, and rupture of the biceps tendon. It is also useful for determining the location of calcium densities near the intertubercular groove, where the long head of the biceps meets the upper part of the humerus. A joint tap and analysis of fluid from the joint will help identify intra-articular (within the joint) disease. An arthroscopic exploration of the shoulder joint will help diagnose bicipital tenosynovitis, rupture of the biceps tendon, and will confirm or rule out intra-articular disease. This method of diagnostics is performed using an arthroscope, a specially equipped endoscope, which is a tubular device that can be inserted into the joint in order to remove fluid, tissue, or other material for analysis. It includes a camera for visual inspection, and can be outfitted with tools for removal of samples, and for treating the cavity or internal structure.

 



Treatment

 

If the disease is severe and long-term your cat will need to be hospitalized for surgical intervention. If the condition is not severe, your cat may be treated on an outpatient basis, especially if the shoulder joint problem was found early.

 

With bicipital tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon and surrounding sheath of the biceps tendon), there is a 50-75 percent chance of success with medical treatment. Surgery is usually required when there is evidence of long-term (chronic) changes and failure to response to non-invasive medical management. Rupture of the tendon of the biceps muscle generally requires surgery. Mineralization of the tendon of the shoulder muscle may be an incidental finding. This condition may require surgery after excluding other causes of lameness and attempting medical treatment. Forcible separation (avulsion) or fracture of the tendon of the shoulder muscle often requires surgery because of persistent bone-fragment irritation of the tendon. Deterioration and scarring of the shoulder muscle requires surgery.

 

Ice packing (known as cryotherapy) immediately following surgery can help to reduce inflammation and swelling at the surgical site. It will need to be performed five to ten minutes every eight hours for three to five days after surgery, or as directed by your veterinarian. Regional massage and range-of-motion exercises can improve flexibility and decrease loss of muscle mass (muscle atrophy) after the initial recovery period. Your veterinarian will advise you on when you should begin physical therapy with your cat.







Following surgery, how much activity your cat can participate in depends on the procedure performed; your pet's veterinarian will provide instructions regarding postoperative activity and restrictions. Medical treatment will require strict confinement for four to six weeks. You may need to enforce a strict period of cage rest, with a liter box kept close by so that your cat does not need to exert itself. It is important to follow your veterinarian's recovery protocols closely to avoid a recurrence or worsening of your cat's physical health. A premature return to normal activity will likely worsen signs and lead to a long-term (chronic) condition.

 

Weight control may need to be a part of your cat's long term care as well, so that excess pressure on the limb does not aggravate the tendons. Depending on your cat's starting weight, your veterinarian may recommend a strict diet for weight loss, or merely a maintenance diet to prevent weight gain. 

 

Living and Management

 

Most patients require a minimum of one to two months of rehabilitation after treatment. Medically managed bicipital tenosynovitis is often successful after one or two treatments in 50-75 percent of cases, with no long-term (chronic) changes. Surgically treated bicipital tenosynovitis has good to excellent results in 90 percent of cases. Recovery will need to be taken slow, with gradual increases of physical movement. Full function may take two to eight months.

 

Surgically treated rupture of the tendon of the biceps muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; more than 85 percent of patients show improved return to function. Surgically treated mineralization of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; recurrence is possible, but uncommon. Surgically treated forcible separation (avulsion) or fracture of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; recurrence is possible, but uncommon. Finally, surgically treated deterioration and scarring (fibrotic contracture) of the infraspinatus muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; patients uniformly return to normal limb function with appropriate recovery time and physical therapy.

138,Shock in Cats,"What Is Shock in Cats?
Shock is a complex, whole-body reaction that can have numerous, different causes and is often the result of a disease process. It occurs when there is an inadequate energy production in the cells or a decrease in the transportation of oxygen (often due to a decrease in blood flow or volume) that results in the death of the cell, the tissue, and ultimately the animal. It is extremely life-threatening and therefore requires prompt veterinary medical attention. 

Types of Shock in Cats

Cats can experience multiple types of shock and they can experience them at the same time, making diagnosis and treatment extremely important!


	
	Hypovolemic shock: This occurs when there is a significant loss of fluid, often seen with hemorrhage, such as from a motor vehicle accident or from significant dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea. The fluid loss is a result of less circulating blood volume and less oxygen being delivered to the body.
	
	
	Cardiogenic shock: Most often witnessed with heart failure, this is a condition where the heart’s ability to contract and push out a normal amount of blood diminishes, causing less and less blood and oxygen to be delivered to the tissues. In cats, this is usually due to the thickening of the heart walls, a type of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
	
	
	Distributive shock: This often occurs as an aftereffect of severe pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), sepsis (infection of the blood stream, most caused by a bacterial infection), or anaphylaxis (allergic response) where there is a decrease in the amount of blood reaching vital organs. This is caused by a dilation of blood vessels and a corresponding drop in blood pressure.
	
	
	Obstructive shock: This occurs when there is an obstruction to the flow of blood.  Fortunately, it’ not common in cats, but it can occur with pericardial effusion (too much fluid in the sac surrounding the heart) or with pulmonary thromboembolism (a blood clot in the lungs).

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Shock in Cats
The majority of cats suffering from shock exhibit the following hallmarks:


	
	Hypothermia (low body temperature, <97 F)
	
	
	Bradycardia (low heart rate, <140 beats per minute)
	
	
	Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure, <100 mmHg systolic)
	


Because the above signs are challenging to determine without the aid of specialized equipment, cat parents will want to look out for the following symptoms:


	
	Lethargy and/or confusion
	
	
	Cooler than normal limbs or paws
	
	
	Pale or discolored gums
	
	
	Shallow or rapid breathing (>60 breaths per minute)
	
	
	Blood-tinged fluid coming from the nose or mouth
	
	
	Rapid or absent pulses
	
	
	Vomiting and diarrhea
	


Causes of Shock in Cats
The causes of shock in cats are numerous, with trauma and allergic reactions the most common after heart disease, infection, heat stroke, complications of underlying illnesses, and exposure to toxins.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Shock in Cats
Because shock is life-threatening, and the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment is critical for survival, taking your cat to the veterinarian (preferably an emergency or specialty hospital), is crucial as soon as symptoms are noticed. The veterinarian will begin with a physical exam, which may prompt certain tests that include measuring your cat’s blood pressure and running baseline bloodwork to check for signs of blood loss and infection, and to determine if its organs are still functioning.

Additional bloodwork may then be advised to measure blood gases, blood clotting ability, and to assess the level of cell damage. To look more intently at your pet’s heart function, a series of imaging tests may be performed. These include X-ray, ultrasound, or an echocardiogram—or all three depending on the signs present—and an electrocardiogram (EKG).

Treatment of Shock in Cats
All cases of shock require immediate veterinary care, and specific treatments will be prescribed tailored to the type of shock. This may include IV fluid therapy and oxygen supplementation as primary supports along with whole-body warming, a blood transfusion, pain control, and other medications to stabilize the blood pressure and treat arrythmias, nausea, and vomiting. Because cats can die from being given the wrong type of blood, your cat’s blood type would need to be determined prior to any transfusion.

Occasionally, surgery may be needed if there is internal or external trauma such as pericardial effusion (in rare cases) where a pericardiocentesis procedure (withdrawing excess fluid from the heart sac) may be required. 

For cats experiencing anaphylactic shock, epinephrine (adrenaline) will most likely be administered immediately to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction. In the treatment of cardiogenic shock, diuretics (water pills) rather than IV fluids are used. For septic shock, antibiotics are given to try to cure the underlying infection.

Cats that have suffered shock need hourly and daily monitoring, as the chances of making a full recovery vary, and are often related to the degree of underlying illness and symptoms present. Cats that are promptly and appropriately treated in the earlier stages of shock often go on to make a full recovery and may have relatively few or no debilitating secondary effects. Others, unfortunately, even with aggressive treatment, may die or suffer from long-term irreversible complications.

The majority of cats suffering from shock exhibit the following hallmarks:


	
	Hypothermia (low body temperature, <97 F)
	
	
	Bradycardia (low heart rate, <140 beats per minute)
	
	
	Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure, <100 mmHg systolic)
	


Because the above signs are challenging to determine without the aid of specialized equipment, cat parents will want to look out for the following symptoms:


	
	Lethargy and/or confusion
	
	
	Cooler than normal limbs or paws
	
	
	Pale or discolored gums
	
	
	Shallow or rapid breathing (>60 breaths per minute)
	
	
	Blood-tinged fluid coming from the nose or mouth
	
	
	Rapid or absent pulses
	
	
	Vomiting and diarrhea

139,Shock Due to Heart Failure in Cats,"Cardiogenic Shock

Cardiogenic shock results from profound impairment of cardiac function, leading to a decrease in stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle during contraction) and cardiac output, congestion of the veins, and narrowing of the blood vessels. Cardiac dysfunction may be caused by an enlarged or dilated heart muscle, compression of the lining of the heart, outflow obstructions, blood clot, severe heart disease, heartworm disease, or severe arrhythmias. Cardiac pump failure may also be secondary to a systemic disease which causes the myocardial layer (middle layer of the heart) to dysfunction, such as from blood poisoning. The result is low blood pressure and compromised blood flow in the tissues, with reduced tissue oxygen delivery.

Most causative conditions for cardiogenic shock are associated with markedly depressed left or right ventricle function, but other conditions that can cause cardiac compression and lead to inadequate filling of the ventricles may also play a role. Leaking from the pericardium – the sac enclosing the heart - or conditions that cause severe inflow or outflow obstruction to the ventricles are possible culprits. Low cardiac outflow can lead to severely low blood pressure, resulting in diminished blood flow to tissues. Further, reduced blood flow to the tissues causes organ ischemia (loss of blood to organs) and energy depletion, leading to abnormal organ function. Secondary organs that are affected include the brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidneys. As shock progresses, congestive heart failure may develop. Abnormal rises in left atrial pressure and pulmonary venous pressure may lead to fluid being trapped in the lungs. Any breed, age, or gender can be affected.

Symptoms and Types


    Pale mucous membranes (from 	decreased blood flow)
    Cool extremities
    Variable heart rate and 	respiratory rate
    Harsh lung sounds and crackles
    Cough
    Weak pulse
    Muscle weakness
    Mental dullness
    Cardiac decompensation may be 	associated with a history of previously compensated heart disease 	and cardiac drug administration
    A suspicion of previously 	undiagnosed cardiac disease may result from a history of coughing, 	exercise intolerance, weakness, or loss of consciousness


Causes

Primary Cardiac Disease

    Dilated heart muscle ‒ 	large-breed cats with taurine (aminosulfonic acid) deficiency
    Small or intermediate-size heart 	muscle in young male cats
    Arrhythmia disturbances
    Pericardial constriction – 	tightening of sac around the heart


Secondary Cardiac Dysfunction

    Sepsis (systemic infection) may 	result in reduced cardiac contractility
    Excess phosphorus in the blood
    Pulmonary blood clot
    Gas in the pleural (chest) cavity


Risk Factors

    Concurrent illness causing 	hypoxemia (subnormal oxygenation of arterial blood), acidosis (an 	increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions in the arterial blood 	above the normal level), and electrolyte imbalances


  

Diagnosis

Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.

Blood pressure measurement will document low blood pressure, and electrocardiography may aid in the detection of arrhythmias. Pulse oximetry, a procedure using a device which measures oxygen saturation by fluctuations of light absorption in well-vascularized (supplied with blood) tissue during systole (contraction) and diastole (dilation) may reveal low blood pressure.  Blood gas analysis may uncover metabolic acidosis, a decreased pH, and bicarbonate concentration in the body fluids, caused either by an accumulation of acids, or by abnormal losses of fixed base from the body, as in diarrhea or renal disease. A chest x-ray may reveal an enlarged heart or evidence of pulmonary edema (congestive heart failure). Echocardiography may document cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle), disease of a heart valve, limited heart muscle contractability, or pericardial compression.

Treatment

If the degree of cardiac dysfunction has progressed to a condition of shock, intensive hospitalized treatment will be necessary. Drainage of the pericardium is essential for patients displaying compression of the lining of the heart, and fluid therapy will be kept to a minimum until cardiac function is improved. This may be done with the use of positive inotropes, fluid or drug agents that alter the force or energy of muscular contractions; with vasodilators, which relax smooth muscles and widen blood vessels to improve flow; or by decompression of a pericardial (heart sac) leakage, as congestive heart failure may be exacerbated.

Cardiovascular monitoring will be conducted by electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical currents of the heart muscle, and measurement of central venous pressure and blood pressure is useful for determining the effectiveness of the given treatment. Oxygen supplementation is important, as with decreased blood flow, there is a concurrent decrease in oxygen reaching the tissues. Oxygen can be administered by oxygen cage, mask, or nasal tube. In addition, your veterinarian will choose any appropriate drugs to treat your cat's specific condition.

Living and Management

After the initial treatment, your veterinarian will want revisit your cat to monitor heart rate, pulse intensity, mucous membrane color, respiratory rate, lung sounds, urine output, mentation (mental activity), and rectal temperature."," and Types

140,Shock Due to Decrease in Circulation in Dogs,"Hypovolemic Shock in Cats

Hypovolemic shock is a condition that occurs when a cat's blood volume or fluid levels drastically drop and shock can begin rapidly. This medical condition affects the renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and the respiratory systems of the cat. Hypovolemic shock is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

Symptoms


    Severe weakness
    Cool feet
    Poor pulse; a pulse that is difficult to read
    Very low blood pressure
    Severe lethargy or inactivity
    Hyperventilation
    Respiratory failure
    Hemorrhage


Causes

Extensive vomiting, diarrhea, severe external burns and injury can cause blood and fluid loss. Shock may also be result of exposure to anticoagulant substances, recurring illnesses and hazardous materials.

If your cat has gastrointestinal bleeding, it may be unable to circulate blood volume, which is another way shock can occur.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will want to determine the underlying cause. Blood tests, including blood gas tests will help to determine electrolyte causes or blood related problems. Imaging can reveal if any cardiac problems have led to the shock. Electrocardiography will identify any issues with your cat's heart. Blood pressure readings are used to determine if the issue is related to the heart's pressure and its ability to circulate blood volume through your cat's body.

Treatment

Treatment is usually administered on an inpatient basis. Immediately, fluid therapy will be given to your cat in order to increase circulation volume and flow.

In order to ensure a successful recovery, ongoing monitoring of your cat's heart rate, pulse, respiratory rate, urine output and body temperature will be taken to. Also, therapeutic steps will be taken to restore your cat's blood volume and circulation levels.

If your cat's body temperature has dropped severely, warming techniques will be used immediately.

Living and Management

There are several possible complications of this medical condition, including electrolyte disturbances, anemia, low protein levels (hypoproteinemia), abnormal cardiac rhythms, and cardiac arrest.

Prevention

There are no known preventative measures for this medical condition.","

141,Shock Due to Bacterial Infection in Cats,"Septic Shock in Cats
 
Septic shock, or sepsis, is a serious physical condition associated with generalized bacterial infection of the body. It develops as a complication of an overwhelming generalized systemic infection. Septic shock is associated with low blood flow (hypoperfusion) or low blood pressure (hypotension), which may or may not respond to fluids or medical treatment given to maintain arterial blood pressure. Cats that are very young or very old are at increased risk due to their undeveloped or lowered immune responses, respectively.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Early shock 

    Rapid heart rate
    Normal or high arterial blood pressure
    Bounding pulses
    Reddened moist tissues of the body
    The pink or red color of the gums is very quick to return when the gums are blanched by finger pressure
    Fever
    Rapid breathing

Late shock

    Rapid heart rate or slow heart rate
    Poor pulse
    Pale gums or moist tissues of the body
    The pink color of the gums is slow to return when the gums are blanched by finger pressure
    Cool extremities (from lack of circulation)
    Low body temperature
    Mental depression or stupor
    Production of only small amounts of urine
    Difficulty breathing; rapid breathing
    Small, pinpoint areas of bleeding in the skin and moist tissues of the body.
    Fluid build-up in the tissues, especially the legs and under the skin (swollen limbs)
    Gastrointestinal bleeding
    Extreme weakness

 
Causes
 

    Possible history of known infection (such as urinary tract infection or infection/inflammation of the prostate)
    Previous surgery may place an animal at increased risk of systemic infection
    Other conditions or treatments that potentially decrease the immune response, such as diabetes mellitus; increased levels of steroids produced by the adrenal glands; Cushing's disease; treatment with high-dosage steroids or chemotherapy regimens
    Compromise of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract resulting in bacteria moving from the intestinal tract into the body and causing bacterial toxins to accumulate in the blood (endotoxemia)
    Infection/inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) and abscesses of the prostate
    Bacterial infection of the lining of the abdomen (septic peritonitis)
    Bacterial infection of the lining of the heart (bacterial endocarditis)
    Gastrointestinal rupture
    Urinary tract infection
    Pneumonia
    Bite wounds




Diagnosis
 
Clinical features include fever, inflammatory response, and collapse of the circulation system. Septic shock associated with circulatory collapse must be differentiated from systemic infection with adequate compensatory cardiovascular response. Circulatory collapse is associated with rapid heart beat or slow heart beat, reduced cardiac output, low blood pressure, reduction of blood flowing into the tissues, and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction such as mental depression, decreased urination, and hemorrhage. Your doctor will want to keep a close watch on your cat's blood pressure.
 
A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian will depend heavily on a urinalysis and blood tests to determine your cat's condition. Visual diagnostics will include chest x-rays to look for pneumonia and to examine the heart. Echocardiography may be used to determine whether the heart muscle is working properly. Abdominal ultrasound may help for detection of an underlying abdominal disease.
 
Treatment
 
Your cat will be hospitalized for circulatory collapse. Vigorous fluid therapy containing crystalloids and colloids will be needed to increase effective circulating blood volume. Crystalloids are fluids that contain electrolytes (chemical compounds such as sodium, potassium, chloride) necessary for the body to function. Crystalloids generally are similar to the fluid content (plasma) of the blood and move easily between the blood and body tissues. Colloids are fluids that contain larger molecules that stay within the circulating blood to help maintain circulating blood volume. Oxygen supplementation is as important as fluid replacement and will be administered by oxygen cage, mask, or nasal cannula (tube). Aggressive treatment and life support may be required if your cat has progressed to a severe stage of shock.
 
Your veterinarian may surgically remove any source of generalized bacterial infection, such as an abscess. Medications will be chosen according to the underlying infection and source of infection.
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will keep a close watch on your cat's heart rate, pulse intensity, color of gums and moist tissues (mucous membrane), breathing rate, lung sounds, urine output, mental status, and rectal temperature. Aggressive treatment is generally called for, with fluids or medications to improve heart muscle contraction. Electrocardiogram (ECG), a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and blood pressure measurement are useful; blood-gas analysis (measurements of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial blood) and pulse oximetry (a means of measuring oxygen levels in blood) to monitor tissue oxygen levels will also yield important information as your veterinarian monitors your cat's progress.

Further treatment will be based on blood work, such as packed cell volume, a means of measuring the percentage volume of red-blood cells as compared to the fluid volume of blood; serum total protein (a quick laboratory test that provides general information on the level of protein in the fluid portion of the blood); serum electrolytes; liver enzymes; blood urea nitrogen and serum creatine levels (the amount of urea and creatine that is found in the blood; they are normally removed from the blood by the kidneys, this test can be an accurate measurement of kidney function). These tests will be done as often as your veterinarian deems it necessary, based on your cat's status and response to treatment. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition and the prognosis will depend on the underlying cause."," and Types

142,Severely Abnormal Heart Rhythm in Cats,"Ventricular Fibrillation in Cats

When ventricle muscles in the heart begin to contract in a disorganized fashion, they quiver, also called ventricular fibrillation. Due to this uncoordinated contraction, blood circulation may cease within minutes, which may be fatal. Although it can affect cats at any age, it seems to affect those that are older.

Symptoms and Types


    Systemic illnesses associated with cardiac disease
    Previous history of heart beat rhythm problems (cardiac arrhythmia)
    Collapse
    Death


Causes


    Absence of oxygen in inspired gases or in arterial blood or in the tissues
    Blockage of the aorta (aortic stenosis)
    Heart surgery
    Drug reactions (e.g., anesthetics, especially fast-acting barbiturates, digoxin)
    Electrical shock
    Electrolyte imbalances
    Hypothermia
    Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)
    Shock


Diagnosis

Unless some underlying infection, metabolic problem, or other such condition is present, the results of routine laboratory tests are usually normal. Your veterinarian will, however, record the ECG (electrocardiogram) results, which is helpful in identifying V-Fib and other related heart problems.

Treatment

This is an emergency that requires prompt and aggressive treatment. In fact, without treatment, most cats die within a matter of minutes. Often, electrical cardioversion is used, wherein an electrical defibrillator is used to deliver small electrical shocks to return the heart to normal rhythm. Initially, low intensity shocks are given; if the heart does not respond, the emergency veterinarian may increase the voltage.

If there is no access to an electrical defribillator, he or she may administer a precordial thump, whereby a sharp blow is applied to the chest wall over the heart with an open fist. Although rarely successful, it may be the only alternative.

Living and Management

Once the cat's heart has returned to a normal rhythm, it will require hospitalization for a few days to fully recover. Regular follow-up exams with the veterinarian will also be required, so that he or she may evaluate the cat's progress (typically with the ECG and other diagnostic procedures)."," and Types

143,Septicemia and Bacteremia in Cats,"Bacterial Infection of the Blood (Sepsis) in Cats



Bacteremia and septicemia occur when the persistent presence of bacterial organisms in a cat's bloodstream becomes systemic, meaning that it has spread throughout the body. This is also referred to as blood poisoning, or septic fever. This condition becomes very dangerous when it leads to abnormally low blood pressure and high body temperature, and can be fatal if left untreated. In severe cases, when the condition has progressed to septic shock, treatment alone will not be enough to save an animal.



Symptoms and Types



There are several signs and symptoms of both septicemia (blood infection) and bacteremia in cats. Remember that septicemia and bacteremia are not the same thing, although they are similar, and are often used interchangeably.




	Sepsis and bacteremia in cats may develop slowly or suddenly
	Signs and symptoms may vary, or they may involve many different organ systems, including the cardiovascular system
	Symptoms are often confused with the signs and symptoms of many other immune-regulated diseases
	Clinical symptoms are often more severe when the organisms involved are gram-negative organisms. These types of organisms are more likely to cause diseases in a cat
	Cats will usually develop symptoms in the respiratory tract first
	Initial physical signs and symptoms typically include chills, fever, and lethargy
	Depression symptoms are common
	Tachycardia (rapid heart beat) and heart murmur are common




Causes



The causes for sepsis and bacteremia in cats are typically caused by pathogens, including gram negative bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae, and salmonella. Infections of these types often result in disease. Risk factors for the disease may include existing diabetes mellitus, or liver and kidney failure. Cats that have weakened immune systems, or those that have skin infections and urinary tract infections are also at risk. Any condition that lowers an animal’s immune system places it at risk for contraction of a bacterial disease.



Diagnosis



A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Before diagnosing your cat, your doctor will want to rule out other possible causes for illness. Diseases that cause similar symptoms may include immune-mediated diseases. Examples of these types of diseases can include autoimmune diseases like thyroidits or lupus.



Radiographic imaging may discover abscesses on the internal organs.





Treatment 



Successful treatment involves diagnosing the problem quickly enough to receive prompt treatment and aggressive intervention. It is important that the problem be addressed as soon as possible due to the possible severity of the condition. Low blood pressure is the most common complication of the disease. Other complications associated with this disease include low blood sugar and electrolyte imbalances. Infections are also common. Cats may be more prone to developing an abscess from an infected wound under the skin.



Nutritional support can dramatically improve the health of cats with sepsis and bacteremia. If your cat is not able to eat by itself it may be necessary to place an intravenous feeding tube until it has stabalized. Medications that may help improve the outcome include antibiotics, antimicrobials, and specialized antibiotics that work specifically on this type of infection (as opposed to routine antibiotics).



Living and Management



It is possible for complications to occur, and a high rate of mortality is associated with this condition. The primarily concerns associated with this are electrolyte imbalances, low blood pressure, and shock. It is extremely critical to seek prompt medical attention for your cat if you suspect any type of infection is imminent or present."," and Types

144,Separation of the Inner Lining of the Eye in Cats,"Retinal Detachment in Cats

Retinal detachment is a disorder in which the retina separates from the innermost lining of the eyeball. This can be caused by a variety of genetic and non-genetic factors, and in some cases is a result of a more serious underlying medical condition. There are some forms of treatment, although retinal detachment may lead to permanent blindness.

The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how retinal detachment affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Cats experiencing a detached retina may show signs of blindness or reduced vision. In some cases, the cat's iris may stay dilated and will not adjust properly when exposed to light.

Causes

While retinal detachment can happen in any breed and at any age, it is more common in older cats. Some animals are born with congenital defects that cause retinal detachment to occur immediately or in the long term. If both retinas are detached, it is most likely a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition. Glaucoma, for instance, is one such condition. Exposure to certain toxins can also cause the retina to detach.

High blood pressure (hypertension) in cats has been shown to be a causative factor for retinal detachment. Other metabolic causes can include hyperthyroidism, characterized by increased levels of thyroid hormone; hyperproteinemia, which is increased protein in the blood; and hypoxia. Other causes can include trauma to the eyes, ocular neoplasia (tumor growth on the eye), and inflammation of the blood vessels in and surrounding the eye.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a full eye exam and order a complete blood work-up on your cat to examine whether the retinal detachment is due to a more serious underlying medical condition.

  

Treatment

Treatment for a detached retina will be determined based on the severity and cause of the medical condition. There are some surgical techniques that are available to reattach the retina, and there are also techniques that can assist in the regeneration of retinal tissue.

If surgery is deemed unnecessary, your veterinarian will treat the underlying medical cause for the retinal detachment by prescribing your cat medication.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will recommend that you restrict the cat's activity post-surgery. There are several possible complications that can occur, including blindness, cloudy lens formation (cataract), glaucoma, and chronic eye pain. In order to quickly identify these complications, your veterinarian will monitor your cat's blood cell counts and recommend frequent follow-up exams.

It is also possible that the retina cannot be reattached, or that the cat's blindness is irreversible. In these cases, your veterinarian may equip you with lifestyle management training skills to improve the overall quality of life for your pet.

Prevention

There are currently no known preventive measures for a detached retina."," and Types

145,Seasonal Allergies in Cats,"What Are Seasonal Allergies in Cats?
Seasonal allergies are also called “atopic dermatitis,” or “atopy,” in cats and are often a result of a genetic defect in the skin barrier system, which allows more allergens to penetrate and cause effects such as itching and scratching, along with secondary skin and ear infections. Allergies are extremely frustrating both for cat and pet parent, as there is no quick cure.

Environmental allergies are often distinguished from other allergies due to their seasonality (causing symptoms in spring and summer), their predictability (by monitoring the pollen counts), their consistency in occurring year after year, and their progressive worsening over time.

Types of Seasonal Allergies in Cats

There are different types of seasonal allergies in cats, and each cat may react differently to one allergen than to another. Seasonal allergies and their related symptoms are usually first seen around 1–3 years of age, starting during the spring and summer months but then occurring year-round, progressively worsening as the cat gets older. Some of the most common seasonal allergies include:


	
	Dander
	
	
	Dust and storage mites
	
	
	Flea saliva, seen more often in warmer months
	
	
	Molds/spores
	
	
	Pollens

	
		
		Grasses—orchard, Bermuda, Bahia
		
		
		Trees—pine, oak, ash, palm
		
		
		Weeds—ragweed, cocklebur, sorrel

Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies in Cats
Unlike people, cats generally don’t get a watery nose or puffy eyes from seasonal allergies. The most common symptom is itching, which leads to scratching and excessive grooming, and for cats this is usually accompanied by:


	
	Hair loss—often by the neck, base of ears, base of tail, or groin; symmetrical along the back
	
	
	Crusts, scabs, or irritated skin
	
	
	Ear infections—often accompanied by inflamed or thickened ears
	
	
	Eosinophilic plaque—reddish-yellow, ulcerated, itchy, thickened lesion on the groin or thighs
	
	
	Indolent ulcer—inflammatory lesion, often disc-shaped, seen on the lips or skin
	
	
	Eosinophilic granuloma—yellowish-pink, raised, linear lesion seen on the hind limbs
	


Causes of Seasonal Allergies in Cats
An allergen is a foreign substance or material that causes an immune reaction (an allergy). The symptoms of an allergic reaction range from mild to severe and can even be life-threatening.

Allergens can be inhaled, ingested, or directly come in contact with the skin—the most common cause of allergies. Cats are often allergic due to a genetic defect in their skin’s barrier, which allows the skin to be more permeable and thus prone to absorbing more allergens, which the immune system then reacts to.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Seasonal Allergies in Cats
Not all itching or scratching in cats is due to allergies. Your veterinarian may want to conduct a series of tests aimed at eliminating other causes. It’s important to note that there is no single test to diagnose atopic dermatitis. It is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is diagnosed by excluding all other causes of itching first, along with supportive evidence such as the cat’s history and symptoms.

Part of arriving at a diagnosis of seasonal allergies is by ruling out food allergies by conducting a food trial and ensuring your cat is on a strict flea-control regimen. Having a positive response to allergy testing can also be indicative of this condition. 

As your cat may have secondary infections, your veterinarian may also want to conduct ear and skin testing to look for mites, fungus, and bacteria. If infections or lesions are severe enough, cultures or even skin biopsies may also be needed. 

Treatment of Seasonal Allergies in Cats
Bacterial and yeast infections, though secondary to the allergy, can increase your cat’s level of itching. Antibiotics and antifungals are usually required for treatment. Long-term treatment with topicals such as medicated shampoos or conditioners is often needed and can decrease the need for repeated antibiotic usage. Allergic cats typically require more frequent bathing than others. 

Because fleas can exaggerate allergy flare-ups, strict year-round flea control using a product such as Revolution® Plus or Comfortis™ is a must. Taking measures to prevent flea infestations, eradicating fleas in the environment when they occur, and ensuring that all pets in the home are on flea control is essential.

However, it’s important to note that without addressing the underlying cause, the itching will return, and long-term use of steroids can result in many health complications.

Antihistamines like diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine are also commonly used to help control the itching, but the response varies depending on the cat. Antihistamines are also better used as a preventive before the allergy season starts. Never give your cat any human drug, including antihistamines, without consulting a veterinarian first.

Fatty acid/omega-3/fish oil supplements may also be recommended. These supplements are often beneficial at improving the skin barrier, decreasing inflammation, and reducing itch. Other immune-modulating drugs, such as cyclosporine (Atopica™), are also available for treating allergies long-term and can be beneficial for many cats.

As with any long-term medication, it is important to follow up with bloodwork every so often to ensure proper dosing and monitoring of side effects. Partner with your veterinarian to determine the need and frequency of future rechecks. 

Allergy Shots for Cats

Allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT), commonly referred to as “allergy shots,” is the most effective long-term therapy for seasonal allergies in cats. Though time-consuming and sometimes costly, these shots decrease the immune system’s response to the allergen over time and can dramatically improve your cat’s quality of life. Intradermal skin or serum testing may be done with a veterinary dermatologist to test which specific substance or substances cause a reaction.

The results of this test are then used to create a “vaccine,” which, when administered in increasing doses over time, decreases the cat’s overall sensitivity. Of course, the allergens included in the “vaccine” are chosen based on their severity as well as being endemic to the cat’s environment.

Recovery and Management of Seasonal Allergies in Cats
Seasonal allergies or, for some parts of the United States, year-round allergies in cats are an extremely common cause of veterinary visits. Skin issues have a financial commitment and a large at-home care requirement. While the goal is to decrease the cat’s period of discomfort and flare-ups, pet parents need to know that even with the best of treatment, allergies will eventually recur, and are often lifelong.

ASIT, still considered the gold standard of treatment, is effective in only about 60-80% of cases, is a lifelong commitment, and requires a 9- to 12-month window to determine success. However, if your cat proves to benefit from ASIT, then keeping up with the injections will be a big investment toward improving your feline friend’s quality of life. 

Other beneficial measures include avoidance of the allergen, when possible, which may mean removing carpeted areas, uprooting plants and weeds, use of HEPA filters, and adhering to a strict flea-control regimen. Recovery cones, t-shirts, or other barrier methods may be useful, as are more frequent bathing and/or leave-on shampoos and conditioners.

Keeping your cat from licking and scratching will prevent future infections, as will monitoring the pollen counts and having the cat examined at the first sign of itching.

Unlike people, cats generally don’t get a watery nose or puffy eyes from seasonal allergies. The most common symptom is itching, which leads to scratching and excessive grooming, and for cats this is usually accompanied by:


	
	Hair loss—often by the neck, base of ears, base of tail, or groin; symmetrical along the back
	
	
	Crusts, scabs, or irritated skin
	
	
	Ear infections—often accompanied by inflamed or thickened ears
	
	
	Eosinophilic plaque—reddish-yellow, ulcerated, itchy, thickened lesion on the groin or thighs
	
	
	Indolent ulcer—inflammatory lesion, often disc-shaped, seen on the lips or skin
	
	
	Eosinophilic granuloma—yellowish-pink, raised, linear lesion seen on the hind limbs

146,Scabies in Cats,"Scabies in Cats
Scabies is not common in cats and usually caused by a regional outbreak. The first symptoms you may notice will be itchy ears that may be crusted on the edges.  



Cats can be affected by two types of scabies mites: 


	
	Notoedres cati (feline scabies) 
	
	
	Sarcoptes scabiei (canine scabies) 
	


Causes of Scabies in Cats
Cats get scabies through contact with an animal that has scabies. For feline scabies, this contact is usually with an affected cat. For canine scabies, the contact is usually with an affected dog. These mites are highly contagious between animals. 

Symptoms of Scabies in Cats
Symptoms usually begin with crusty and itchy ear edges.

Other symptoms include: 


	
	Intense itching 
	
	
	Skin flaking 
	
	
	Hair loss 
	
	
	Inflammation
	


Feline scabies will generally spread to your cat’s face, and if not treated, their entire body.

 

Diagnosing Scabies in Cats
Scabies are typically diagnosed through skin scrapings that are examined under a microscope. If scabies mites are present, they are easy to see under magnification. However, the absence of mites/eggs on a skin scraping does not rule out an infestation. Diagnosis is sometimes made by response to treatment. 

Treatment of Feline Scabies
Treatment options for feline scabies include:


	
	Although isoxazoline flea control products such as Bravecto® and Revolution Plus® are not approved to treat scabies in cats because the condition is so rare, a single dose is effective. 
	
	
	Selamectin (Revolution®) is approved for use in dogs for sarcoptic mange, but it is not approved for feline use because scabies are so rare in cats. However, it is an effective treatment for cat scabies.
	
	
	Moxidectin (Advantage Multi®) is effective but also not approved.
	
	
	Ivermectin is one of the first treatments used for feline scabies and is still used today. It is usually given by injection every 1-2 weeks for a month.  
	
	
	Older treatments such as lime sulfur or amitraz (Mitaban®) dips are effective but have fallen out of favor because easier treatment options are now available.
	


Recovery and Management of Feline Scabies
Response to scabies treatment generally takes a few weeks, depending on the medication your vet recommends and the number of animals affected.

Routine use of Bravecto®, Revolution Plus®, Revolution®, or Advantage Multi® should stop your cat from becoming infested after treatment. 

If your cat has a Notoedres or Sarcoptes scabies infestation, all cats and dogs in contact with your pet should be treated. Humans may also be affected by scabies, but since they are not a primary host, the problem is usually mild.

147,Sarcocystis Infection in Cats,"Sarcocystosis in Cats

The causative agent of sarcocystosis (Sarcocystis) is the same organism that causes equine protozoal meningitis. Cats that live around horses and other herbivores (cattle, swine, etc.) may serve as a reservoir for infection for these animals. Symptoms in infected cats are rare however.

Sarcocystosis can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of infection affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms in cats are rarely seen but may include:


    Lack of appetite
    Weight loss
    Diarrhea, potentially      bloody diarrhea
    Dehydration
    Depression
    Paralysis


Causes

A cat may be infected by eating raw meat contaminated with Sarcocystis organisms.

Diagnosis

Occasionally, Sarcocystis organisms can be seen in the feces on microscopic fecal examination. However, in most instances, diagnosis is accomplished by finding the organism on histopathology in tissues such as the lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, brain and/or muscle.

More specialized testing such as immunohistochemistry and PCR may be available at some research facilities but are not widely available outside of a research setting.



Treatment

No definitive treatment for sarcocystosis exists. Treatments such as clindamycin or sulfadiazine may be tried if sarcocystosis is suspected or diagnosed.

Prevention

Do not allow your cat to eat raw or uncooked meat."," in infected cats are rare however.

148,Roundworms in Cats,"What Are Roundworms in Cats?
Roundworms are very common parasites that thrive in the intestines of a cat. They can grow to 3-6 inches long, are cream-colored, and resemble spaghetti noodles when seen in the stool. Adult roundworms often swim freely in the intestines, where they produce eggs. Those eggs are shed into the stool of affected cats and can then infect other animals.

Symptoms of Roundworms in Cats
Although it is usually not life-threatening in adult cats, a roundworm infection can kill kittens and older cats. Kittens often have fewer reserves to compensate for loss from the roundworm; older cats may have other diseases that decrease their body’s ability to compensate for loss.

In kittens, symptoms include:


	
	Poor growth rate
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Crying and vocalizing
	
	
	Pot-bellied appearance
	


In adult cats, symptoms are less severe, but a large amount of worms may cause an intestinal blockage. Early symptoms include:


	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Dull hair coat
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Pot-bellied appearance
	


Causes of Roundworms in Cats
An adult female roundworm produces eggs that are passed out of the body in the infected feces of a cat. Other cats become infected by ingesting roundworm eggs or by eating rodents that have ingested the eggs. Hatched eggs produce larvae that travel to the lungs, are coughed up, then are often swallowed again to finish their life cycle in the intestines. There, roundworm larvae mature into adult roundworms. Very young kittens can become infected through the milk when nursing from an infected mother.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Roundworms in Cats
Veterinarians diagnose roundworms by looking for eggs in the stool. You may be asked to bring in a sample of your cat’s stool to the vet. If your cat is small, produces little stool, or has severe diarrhea, the sample may be sent to an outside lab that uses a test with increased sensitivity to detect parasites.

Treatment of Roundworms in Cats
There are many oral and topical medications that effectively treat roundworms. To kill all the roundworm's life stages, multiple doses of medication are given on a schedule. Treatment continues until your cat has two stool tests where no parasites are seen.

Medications are given by mouth and are typically one of the following:


	
	Fenbendazole
	
	
	Drontal
	
	
	Profender
	


When roundworms are caught early and treated on a schedule, cats can recover in two to six weeks, depending on the severity of the disease. After the infection has cleared, cats can return to a normal life. It is possible to see a reinfection if your cat is again exposed to roundworm eggs or infected rodents.

Recovery and Management of Roundworms in Cats
Because cats may be reinfected, homecare management is important during treatment for roundworms and after recovery. The primary aim is to decrease exposure to infected feces, which can be done by:


	
	Cleaning the litter box often
	
	
	Limiting roaming and hunting time outside
	
	
	Washing litter boxes regularly with pet-safe disinfectant
	
	
	Washing your hands with soap and water after cleaning
	


Keep recently adopted new cats or kittens separate from other pets in the household until they are examined by a veterinarian. Submit a fecal sample for testing before a female cat is bred and before she gives birth. Administering treatment for roundworms before the kittens are born will reduce the likelihood of transmission while nursing. There are medications to treat roundworms that are safe to administer during a cat’s pregnancy and while they are nursing.

Prevention of Roundworms in Cats
The best prevention for roundworms in cats is regular deworming and limited or no exposure to the outdoors. Deworming is recommended at each kitten visit when they get their vaccines. Adult cats should get routine parasite prevention, such as a heartworm preventative that usually includes prevention for roundworms.

Pregnant cats or ones that recently gave birth should be dewormed with medication that is safe for pregnant and nursing cats. Cats that like to hunt and indoor/outdoor cats should have a stool test and deworming several times a year. Indoor cats can be exposed to roundworms from newly adopted cats, dogs in the household that go outside, or even from what we may track into the home on our shoes.

It is recommended that every year all cats have a stool test and, in some cases, are given dewormer.
Roundworms in Cats FAQsAre roundworms contagious to other cats?Yes. Sharing litter boxes, food, or water bowls and hunting together increases the likelihood of spreading roundworms between cats. Also, an infected mother can spread roundworms to all the kittens in a litter. If a cat in your home has roundworms, be sure to separate them from healthy pets until they have fully recovered.
Are roundworms contagious to people?Yes. In most cases, people are infected by ingesting eggs from soil or sandboxes. They can also become infected from their household cat. Children are most susceptible, and, although rare, roundworm infections can be serious. Hand washing with soap and water after handling infected cats and litter boxes and playing outside is important to prevent an infection.

149,Ringworm in Cats,"What Is Ringworm in Cats?
Ringworms or ringworm are the common names for dermatophytosis, a fungal infection that can affect a cat’s skin, hair, and nails.

The fungus, which feeds on dead cells, is not actually a worm. The name ""ringworm"" originated from the target-shaped lesion surrounded by a scaly ring seen in humans. It’s spread by direct skin-to-skin contact between people or between infected animals and people. 

For ringworm in cats, this fungal infection is typically presented through hair loss and scaly lesions.

Symptoms of Ringworm in Cats
Symptoms of ringworm in cats include:


	
	Thickened patches of skin
	
	
	Circular areas of hair loss (may be patchy)
	
	
	Broken and stubby hair
	
	
	Scaly or crusty skin
	
	
	Changes in fur or skin color
	
	
	Inflamed areas of skin
	
	
	Excessive grooming and scratching
	
	
	Red or gray, scaly lesions (typically on the skin of a cat’s head, chest, front legs, and spine)
	
	
	Dull fur
	
	
	Dandruff
	
	
	Rough, scaly, hardening of the base of the nails
	
	
	Distortion of the nails
	
	
	Nail infections (rare)
	


In some more severe cases of ringworm in cats, the skin lesions are raised and nodular. These are called granulomas and may frequently produce discharge. 

Many cats, especially longhaired breeds, may have ringworm without any symptoms at all. These cats are called asymptomatic carriers.

Asymptomatic cats may still infect other pets or humans. It’s important to note that even though these cats don’t look sick, they may be highly contagious. 

Causes of Ringworm in Cats
Ringworm in cats is spread through direct contact with the fungus. It may be passed by direct contact with an infected animal or person, the soil, or a contaminated surface. It’s rare—though possible—for ringworm to be spread through brushes, combs, and beds.

The fungal spore can survive and remain dormant on bedding, carpet, furniture, brushes, and/or other surfaces for up to 18 months.

Direct contact with a fungal spore causes infection, typically through open wounds (such as a scratch). However, immunosuppressed cats (cats with the decreased ability to develop a normal immune response) can get infected even without open skin.

Some predisposing factors for ringworm in cats include: 


	
	Age—Kittens and older cats with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk for infection. 
	
	
	Climate—Cats that live in warmer, more humid climates have a higher infection rate. 
	
	
	Care—Cats who live in a densely populated environment (such as an animal shelter) or receive poor nutrition are at a higher risk for infection due to the contagious and resistant nature of this fungus. 
	
	
	Health—Immune suppression can increase the risk of ringworm infection, especially in cats with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).
	


The period between exposure to the fungus and the development of symptoms is usually between seven to 14 days, though with some cases, three to four weeks may pass before symptoms appear.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Ringworm in Cats
There are several tests that can be performed to help diagnoses ringworm in cats. These include:

A wood’s light (fluorescent lamp) can be used to help identify some forms of ringworm.

Your veterinarian may also recommend looking for fungal spores under a microscope and culturing a sample of the fungus.

Difficult cases may require more advanced testing, such as PCR testing or skin biopsies.

Treatment for Ringworm in Cats
Treatment for ringworm in cats is usually a combination of medication applied to a cat’s skin and oral medication. Treatment lasts for a minimum of four to six weeks. In some cases, several months of therapy is required.

Ringworm cultures are performed after the start of treatment to determine if the infection is still present.

Treatment is typically continued until two consecutive negative ringworm cultures are obtained, usually two to four weeks apart. 

Topical Therapy

Topical treatment for ringworm in cats is directly applied to the skin. The treatment directly kills fungal spores, which is important in preventing environmental contamination and helpful in preventing contamination to other animals. Topical treatment will usually continue for several weeks or even months depending on your cat’s diagnosis. 

Oral Therapy

Oral therapy for ringworm in cats may be recommended for severe or difficult cases.

This treatment stops reproduction and spread of the fungal infection. Once treated, only the original fungus remains and can be removed with other treatment options.

Your veterinarian may prescribe one of the following: 


	
	Itraconazole 
	
	
	Terbinafine 
	
	Griseofulvin

Individual cats may have different reactions, but if therapy is discontinued too soon, the infection may recur.

Disinfecting The Environment

Infected cat hairs containing microscopic fungus spores may have been shed around your home.

Infection of other animals and humans, or reinfection of the affected cat, can occur from contact with the contaminated environment.

Ways to disinfect the environment include:


	
	Keeping all pets’ fur clipped short during treatment of the infection
	
	
	Careful hygiene to remove all pet hair from the environment
	
	
	Careful disinfection of areas frequented by the pets to attempt to kill the fungus in the environment

Recovery and Management of Ringworm in Cats
Commitment is the key to success in getting rid of ringworm in cats. Clean your home and test and isolate pets that have been in contact with the affected cat until they are found clear of infection. 

Keep your infected cat away from other animals, objects, surfaces, and family members. Wear gloves when handling your cat and wash your hands thoroughly afterward. 

Most cats who get appropriate treatment will recover from a ringworm infection, and you should see improvement within two to three weeks.

Symptoms may reoccur if the treatment is discontinued early or is not aggressive enough, or if there is an underlying condition affecting your cat’s immune system.

If an infection persists, your veterinarian may try alternative medications.

Prevention of Ringworm in Cats 
Ringworm in cats can be prevented by:


	
	Keeping your pets healthy and current on their routine preventative care
	
	
	Avoiding crowding and stress
	
	
	Having new pets examined by a veterinarian before bringing them into the house and exposing them other people and pets. 
	
	
	Have any skin lesions checked promptly by a veterinarian to catch any issues as early as possible
	

Ringworm in Cats FAQsWhat does ringworm look like on a cat?Ringworm can vary dramatically between animals, but most commonly shows up as a round hairless area with a red, rashy appearance in the center of the lesion. 

These spots can be small (typically a few centimeters in size). They may be itchy, and often appear on the face or trunk.
Can ringworm spread from cats to humans?Many forms of ringworm are contagious between cats and people. Any suspected spots should be checked by both your veterinarian and physician promptly.
Will ringworm go away on its own?Generally, ringworm doesn’t go away on its own and requires proper diagnosis and treatment to resolve. 

Often, any underlying conditions (such as viral infections or immune disorders) need to be diagnosed and treated before the ringworm will resolve.

150,Retained Testicle in Cats,"Cryptorchidism in Cats
 
Cryptorchidism is a condition characterized by incomplete or nonexistent descent of the testes. The testes normally descend into the scrotum while an animal is still very young. For cats, the testes have generally dropped into place before birth. When the descent of one, or both, of the testes does not take place, the testis that has not descended is retained somewhere in the lower part of the body. For example, they are sometimes retained in the inguinal canal - a passage in the groin that conveys the spermatic cord to the testes. If the testis is in the inguinal canal, it can be felt (palpated) during a physical examination. If the testis is deeper in the abdomen, it will be difficult to palpate or identify with an X-ray. Ultrasound is the best available option to determine the size and location of the testis if it is in the abdomen.
 
This abnormality can occur in almost all breeds, with the right and left testes failing to descend at equal frequency (neither testis is more likely than the other to be retained). One-sided failure to descend is more common than both sides failing to descend. Ranges of 1 to 1.7 percent of cases have been reported in the cat population. The condition may be inherited, but there is no data that documents a hereditary defect in cats. The surveys that have been conducted regarding cats have over-represented Persian cats and underrepresented other breed populations, making any findings for this condition inconclusive.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
This condition is rarely associated with pain or any other sign of disease. However, acute onset of abdominal pain generally indicates that the spermatic cord of the retained testes has become twisted, cutting off the blood supply to the testis. Many times, this testis will develop tumors, which is symptomized by feminine behavior.
 
Causes
 
What causes the testis to remain undescended, or incompletely descended, is unknown. Some of the reasons that have been concluded so far have pointed to a genetic flaw. Conversely, the condition may not have a hereditary predisposing factor at all, but may still be linked to an occurrence that took place in the intrauterine environment during the formation of the developing fetus (i.e., pregnancy). An adverse condition or environmental factor can lead to a congenital malformation, perhaps affecting only one in a litter. This condition is not preventable.
 
 
 
Diagnosis
 
To arrive at a diagnosis, your veterinarian will use ultrasound to locate the undescended testis if it is suspected to be in the abdomen, along with palpation (touch) of the groin and abdomen to locate the testis. Although rare, a cat may have both testes undescended. There will be an attendant odor of urine about the cat that is indicative of this condition.
 
Treatment
 
The castration of both testes is generally recommended. Even if one testis has descended and the other has not, your veterinarian will most likely counsel you to have both removed. Surgical placement of an undescended testicle into the scrotum is considered unethical."," and Types

151,Retained Deciduous Teeth in Cats,"Retained Baby Teeth in Cats
 
A retained or persistent deciduous (baby) tooth is one that is still present despite the eruption of the permanent tooth (which takes place between three to sevens months of age). Such teeth may go undiagnosed until later in life.
 
Persistent deciduous teeth can cause the permanent teeth to erupt in abnormal positions, resulting in a bad bite. The “bite” describes how the upper and lower teeth fit together in the mouth and can have a significant effect on biting and chewing. Early recognition and reparative dental care is essential. Retained teeth can cause overcrowding of new teeth,  teeth to bite into the palate, and abnormal tooth position or abnormal jaw position. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Bad breath (halitosis)
    Abnormally-positioned permanent teeth
    Swollen, red, bleeding gums around baby teeth
    Local gingivitis and periodontal disease due to teeth overcrowding
    A permanent abnormal passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity (oronasal fistula)

 
Causes
 
None identified.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam, which will include inspecting your cat's mouth. Your veterinarian will chart the teeth present in the mouth to assure and record the presence of deciduous (baby) teeth along with the teeth that have succesfully grown in. X-rays of the inside of the mouth may also need to be taken to make certain which teeth are baby teeth and which are permanent teeth, to see if the baby tooth is ready to fall out or be removed, and to make sure that the baby tooth has a permanent tooth to replace it.



Treatment
 
The deciduous (baby) tooth should be surgically removed as soon as the permanent tooth has begun pushing through your cat’s gums. In addition, fractured or retained root(s) may need to be removed with a gingival flap -- a procedure in which the gums are separated from the teeth and folded back to allow a veterinarian to reach the root of the tooth and the bone.
 
Living and Management
 
After surgery, restrict your cat’s activity for the rest of the day. Feed him or her a soft diet—canned or moistened dry kibble—as well as restrict its access to chew toys for 24 hours after surgery. 
 
Your veterinarian will provide you with oral pain medication to give to your pet for one to three days after surgery. You may also be asked to administer an oral rinse or gel in your pet's mouth for three to five days after surgery. Daily brushing, meanwhile, should commence 24 hours after brushing."," and Types

152,Retained Afterbirth in Cats,"Retained Placenta in Cats

A retained placenta, or retained afterbirth, occurs when the placenta (the sac surrounding an unborn kitten) is not expelled from the mother’s uterus along with the kitten at the time of birth or shortly after.

Symptoms and Types


    Green discharge from      vulva that continues
    Fever (in some cases)
    Systemic disease (in      some cases)


Causes

The placenta is retained in the uterus rather than being expelled with or shortly after the birth of the kitten.

Diagnosis

History of a recent birth with a physical examination finding of a green discharge from the vulva is supportive of a diagnosis of retained placenta. Your veterinarian may recommend routine blood testing, though these results may be normal. Vaginal cytology may also be recommended. Your veterinarian may need to take X-rays and/or perform an ultrasound of the uterus. In some cases, exploratory surgery may be necessary.



Treatment

Oxytocin may be administered in an attempt to expel the retained placenta. If medical treatment with oxytocin is unsuccessful, ovariohysterectomy (spay) may be recommended if your cat is not to be bred again."," and Types

153,Reproductive Genetic Abnormalities in Cats,"Sexual Development Disorders in Cats
  
Sexual development disorders in cats can occur due to errors in the genetic coding, involving chromosomes responsible for the development of the sex organs - including the gonads (the male and female reproductive organs), or when errors in gene development result in abnormal sexual differentiation, making it difficult to distinguish between male and female animals.

Symptoms and Types

This condition is usually caused by disorders affecting the chromosomes that determine the traits of an animal's sexual function. Gonadal disorders affect the reproductive organs, and phenotypic disorders affect the physical and biochemical reproductive properties of the animal. The signs and symptoms of gonadal or reproductive sexual development disorders may include having an unusually large clitoris, for the female, or having an undescended testicle, for the male. Other unusual reproductive organ characteristics may also be present.

Signs and symptoms of chromosomal sexual development disorders may include defects in the number of sex chromosomes. In the process of genetically screening your cat, your veterinarian may find an abnormal number of X or Y chromosomes in your cat's genetic make-up.

Signs and symptoms of phenotypic sexual development disorders may include external reproductive organs that do not match the internal chromosomes. A cat that carries male chromosomes for example, may appear to have feminine external genitalia, or a smaller than normal penis. Some animals may possess a normal reproductive organ, but also have an additional, sometimes functional, very small second reproductive organ of the opposite gender.

Causes

Sexual development disorders most commonly occur because of inherited traits or because of external causes, like the administration of toxins to the pregnant female parent (such as hormones) during pregnancy. Risk factors may also include the ingestion or administration of male or female hormones, like progesterone, during pregnancy.

Diagnosis

Sexual development disorders are very rare, but are often apparent from birth, especially if they affect the reproductive organs and involve overly large or small reproductive organs. Individual animals that are normal in appearance, with normal external reproductive organs and abnormal chromosomes, may not be identified until they reach their reproductive years.

Diagnosis may not occur until attempts are made to breed the animal. During this time other diagnoses to rule out may include infertility, hormonal problems, including hypothyroidism, testicular problems, including degeneration, and poor timing during breeding.

Once the above conditions are ruled out, your veterinarian may carry out tests to measure hormone levels, and may conduct tests to define chromosomal sex characteristics to see whether abnormalities exist in the sex chromosomes. Physical tests will include making note of the shape and size of the reproductive organs for comparative purposes, to confirm whether any external abnormalities exist.


Treatment 

Treatment and care will depend on the condition. Some patients will present with skin conditions along with the reproductive sex disorders. In these cases local or topical treatments may provide symptomatic relief. Shampoos or oils may be helpful for topical treatment. In some cases reconstructive surgery may be used to restore a more uniform cosmetic appearance in animals with deformed reproductive organs.

The removal of an overly large clitoris (part of the female reproductive organ) may be necessary, especially if it is causing trauma to your cat. Sterilization may be necessary for the prevention of later complications, including recurring urinary tract infections.

Living and Management

Most animals recover well from surgical and other procedures that are done to improve their cosmetic and physical health. Avoiding synthetic hormones, including progesterone, estrogen, or androgen, may be advised, depending on the type of sexual development disorder your cat has."," and Types

154,Rectal Prolapse in Cats,"What Is Rectal Prolapse in Cats? 
Rectal prolapse occurs when some or all of the rectal tissue protrudes through your cat’s anus. Rectal issue is usually dark pink or dark red. The rectum is the part of the intestinal tract that connects the large intestine to the anus. 

There are two main types of rectal prolapse: 


	
	Incomplete: In this condition, the rectal tissue will protrude when your cat is straining to pee or poop, usually without producing much. After the cat is done straining, the rectal tissue will go back to its normal position and no longer be visible. This is a serious condition, however, because it can get worse and should be treated. 
	
	
	Complete: In a complete rectal prolapse, all layers of the rectum protrude through the anal opening. It will look like a tube, with the inner lining of the rectum visible on the outside (everted). A complete rectal prolapse requires immediate veterinary attention.
	


Symptoms of Rectal Prolapse in Cats
Cats with rectal prolapse will often act very uncomfortable and may not want to move around much. They may lick at their rectum and continue to posture and strain to poop, pee, or give birth, depending on the cause of the prolapse. 



The color of the exposed rectum is important. A recently prolapsed rectum will be dark pink but will quickly turn dark red as swelling and exposure progress. 



If the rectal prolapse is not treated quickly, the rectum may turn very dark red to black. Darker colors may be a sign of tissue death (e.g., necrosis). This is very serious and may result in long-term complications. The wall of the prolapsed rectum may also break (e.g., ulcerate) and swell.

 

Causes of Rectal Prolapse in Cats
Rectal prolapse can be caused by any medical condition that causes a cat to strain too hard while peeing or pooping. Straining weakens the tissue that supports the rectum. 



These conditions could cause rectal prolapse in cats: 


	
	Intestinal parasites 
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Constipation 
	
	
	Obstruction of the colon or rectum because of a foreign object
	
	
	Rectal or vaginal mass
	
	
	Urinary obstruction 
	
	
	Giving birth 
	


In kittens, diarrhea due to intestinal parasites is the most common cause of rectal prolapse. 

Certain breeds of cats, such as the Manx cat, or cats that have had tail amputations, may be more prone to rectal prolapse if the nerves to their rectum and anus were affected.

How Vets Diagnose Rectal Prolapse in Cats
Rectal prolapse in cats is diagnosed with a physical examination. By the time most cases are seen by a veterinarian, the prolapse is often complete, so the rectum is constantly exposed, rather than only being visible when a cat is pooping. 

A completely prolapsed rectum will look like a long, tubular mass protruding from the anus. Rectal masses may sometimes look like rectal prolapses. In general, if you see any type of tissue protruding from the anal opening, you should see your vet right away. 

Once the prolapse is diagnosed, your vet will try to determine if there’s an underlying cause. Treating the underlying cause can sometimes resolve the condition. Underlying causes of rectal prolapse include intestinal parasites, rectal masses, stenosis of the rectum (narrowing), or an enlarged prostate. All of these conditions can cause your cat to strain while pooping, which can lead to rectal prolapse. 

A stool sample should be checked to rule out intestinal parasites. Bloodwork and x-rays of the abdomen and may be recommended if the underlying cause of the prolapse is not obvious based on physical examination alone. 

Treatment for Rectal and Anal Prolapse in Cats
Your cat may have a simple rectal prolapse, or they may require rectal prolapse surgery, where part of the rectum must be surgically removed. You will also need to treat the underlying cause of the rectal prolapse.

Simple Rectal Prolapse

Treatment of rectal prolapse usually requires your cat to be anesthetized during the procedure. Reducing a prolapsed rectum can be painful, and a prolapsed cat will already be in pain and distress. 

After your cat is safely sleeping, the rectal tissue will be carefully and thoroughly cleaned. It there is swelling, your vet may use medications or hypertonic saline (a special type of saline solution with a higher salt concentration than regular saline solution) to help decrease swelling. A rectal exam should also be performed to rule out a rectal mass or other abnormality. 

If the rectal tissue is still healthy, your veterinarian can usually manually reduce the prolapse after flushing the rectum thoroughly with sterile saline. Once clean, the rectum will be lubricated and gently replaced inside the pelvic cavity.

Once the prolapse is reduced, a technique known as a purse-string suture is used to make the anal opening smaller so the rectum cannot prolapse again while your cat heals. 

Rectal Prolapse Surgery

If the rectum has been prolapsed long enough for the tissue to become necrotic (black and dying), the dying portion of the rectum must be surgically removed. Healthy rectal tissue is then surgically reattached to more healthy tissue. 

Depending on how much rectum must be removed, this can result in fecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements) or other elimination issues. These may be temporary or long-term.

Colopexy

If a cat has a history of repeat rectal prolapses—or if surgery is required to remove dead tissue—a procedure called a colopexy may be performed. In a colopexy, the rectum is attached to the abdomen wall using an internal suture (stitch). This is an extensive abdominal surgery, but it can help prevent repeat prolapse events. 

Treating the Underlying Cause

To avoid recurrence of rectal prolapse, the underlying cause of the prolapse must also be treated. This treatment will depend on the underlying cause. 

If the prolapse is due to birthing kittens, your cat must be spayed so it won’t happen again. 

Intestinal parasites can be treated by deworming, while a urinary stone or obstruction will need its own treatment, and so on. 

Recovery and Management of Rectal Prolapse in Cats
If your cat has diarrhea during the healing period, contact your vet right away. Your cat will likely need additional treatment. Diarrhea increases the risk of another rectal prolapse. 

After surgery, most cats will be prescribed pain medication, stool softeners, and possibly antibiotics. Their medications depend on the health of their rectal tissue at the time of surgery. Epidurals are sometimes used to eliminate the urge to strain when your cat goes to the bathroom, and as a form of pain control. 

A cat who receives an epidural and/or who has a surgical repair of their rectal prolapse may require hospitalization for 1-3 days, depending on how they are doing. If your cat received a purse-string suture, they may be sent home the day of the procedure. 

The period of rest after a rectal prolapse repair depends somewhat on whether a purse-string was performed, or whether part of the rectum had to be surgically removed. The more serious the repair, the longer and stricter the rest period will be.



Recovery After a Simple Rectal Prolapse

Recovery from a simple rectal prolapse, where the rectal tissue was healthy and could be reduced without complication, requires that the purse-string suture remains in place for 5-7 days while your cat heals. 

During the recovery period, your cat must wear an E-collar to prevent licking, which can cause the suture to fall out early and increase the risk of infection. 

Soft foods and stool softeners will be prescribed to reduce pressure on the purse-string suture while your cat poops. After your cat is healed, the purse-string suture should be removed by a veterinarian, who will clear your cat for regular food. 



Recovery After Prolapse Surgery

Recovery after a prolapse repair that required surgical removal of part of the rectum will take a bit longer. After surgery, most cats will need to wear an E-collar and be on soft food and stool softeners for 10-14 days or longer. 

Potential complications for prolapse repair include a recurrence of the prolapse (meaning that the repair is unsuccessful), fecal incontinence, and infection. 



Recurrence of Prolapse

If your cat experiences another prolapse, it will look very similar to the first occurrence, with rectal tissue protruding from the anus. If it’s infected, the tissue will be red and swollen, and you may see discharge around your cat’s anus.

Fecal incontinence, or not being able to control pooping, is uncommon, but it is possible if part of the rectum had to be surgically removed. 
Rectal Prolapse in Cats FAQsCan a rectal prolapse heal itself in cats? No. While cats are amazing at healing, a rectal prolapse should always be treated by a veterinarian to prevent serious complications. This is a serious and painful condition and should be treated as soon as it is noticed. 
What happens if a rectal prolapse goes untreated in a cat? If a rectal prolapse is not treated promptly, the rectum will swell, develop sores, and begin to dry out. This can then lead to necrosis (death) of the tissue and may cause infection, sepsis, and death. 
How can you tell the difference between hemorrhoids and rectal prolapse in cats? Cats do not truly get hemorrhoids the same way humans do, although they can get inflammation around the anus from diarrhea or anal sac disease. 



If your cat shows any sign of swelling, redness, and inflammation around the anus, veterinary attention is necessary. If you have any question about whether your cat’s rectum may be prolapsed, contact your vet or an emergency clinic right away. 



You also need to contact your veterinarian if your cat has been straining to pee or poop. Not only could this indicate a medical emergency, but it could also result in rectal prolapse.

155,Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats,"What Is Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats?
The rectum is the last part of the colon, where stool is stored until a cat has a bowel movement and the stool passes through the opening to the outside (the anus). If the rectum or anus becomes inflamed, it’s called proctitis.

There are several conditions that can lead to proctitis in cats. When the entire colon is inflamed, this is called colitis, a common condition in cats. Colitis proctitis means the colon, rectum, and anus are all inflamed. Proctitis alone (inflammation of just the rectum and anus) is less common.

Because the rectum has an important role in helping a cat absorb water and firm up their stool, it does not function properly when inflamed. This can cause a cat to have diarrhea.

The anus may turn red when it’s inflamed. This is because chronic diarrhea may lead to a condition called rectal prolapse, and when this happens, pink tissue from the rectum protrudes from a cat’s anus.

Fortunately, proctitis is rarely a medical emergency when addressed by a veterinarian within a few days. However, if your cat is experiencing lethargy, vomiting, weakness, or fever in addition to their proctitis, bring them to an emergency vet. Prolonged diarrhea can lead to significant dehydration and more serious illness, and potentially death. 

Symptoms of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
Common symptoms of rectal and anal inflammation in cats include:


	
	Diarrhea
	



	
	Frequent small, loose stools
	
	
	Straining to have bowel movements
	
	
	Increased urgency to go to the bathroom
	
	
	Accidents outside the litterbox
	
	
	Mucus or fresh blood on feces
	
	
	Redness or ulceration of the anus and surrounding tissue
	
	
	Prolapse of rectal tissue out the anal opening
	
	
	Licking of the anus
	


Causes of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
Rectal and anal inflammation can be caused by many things.

Parasites

The most common cause of colon and rectal inflammation in young cats is parasites, like intestinal worms and protozoa.

Parasites Giardia or Tritrichomonas foetus can lead to chronic diarrhea and straining. This may irritate the lining of the rectum and make the anus inflamed and raw.

Infections

Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can also lead to inflammation of rectum and anus. Campylobacter, clostridium, salmonella, and E. coli are all common bacterial agents that can irritate the lining of the large intestine. Feline parvovirus and feline coronavirus are viral agents that often lead to gastrointestinal inflammation and diarrhea.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can affect the GI tract in cats in the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missouri river valley regions.

Allergies

Some cats may develop dietary intolerance or food allergies that lead to colitis proctitis. Allergies—usually to the protein source in the food—cause inflammation in the GI tract and subsequent gastrointestinal symptoms.

Foreign Body Ingestion

Occasionally, cats will ingest non-food items. Linear foreign bodies, like string, are especially enticing to young cats. The string-like objects can cause the intestines to bunch up and irritate the lining of the intestines. This can also occur when cats ingest sharp objects like animal bone shards, needles, or pins.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Underlying infections and allergies can lead to a chronic condition called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

While IBD more commonly affects the stomach and small intestine, it can also affect the large intestine. This can lead to colitis and proctitis. This condition is more common in middle-aged and older cats and its symptoms are similar to those of gastrointestinal lymphoma, which is the most common cause of intestinal cancer in cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
To diagnose rectal and anal inflammation, your veterinarian will start with getting a thorough history of your cat.

Let your veterinarian know about any fecal abnormalities. They may ask the following:


	
	How often is your cat having diarrhea? Is it small amounts, more frequently, or voluminous?
	
	
	Is your cat straining when trying to have bowel movements?
	
	
	Are they having fecal accidents outside the litterbox?
	
	
	How long ago did the issue start?
	
	
	How is their appetite?
	
	
	Are they vomiting as well?
	


Additionally, let your vet know if your cat is allowed outdoors or does any hunting. Cats that go outdoors are more likely to be exposed to infectious diseases from other cats and to internal parasites from hunting. Also share if you have acquired any new cats and whether you use regular parasite prevention products.

Your veterinarian will then do a complete physical exam of your cat. They will palpate your pet’s abdomen and examine their anus.

They may recommend a fecal testing, blood work, and X-rays of your cat’s abdomen depending on their history. Sometimes additional testing—like an abdominal ultrasound or fecal PCR testing—is performed as well.

Treatment of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
Treatment will be based on the underlying cause of your cat’s inflammation.

If your cat has parasites, they may be prescribed anti-parasitic medications.

Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, and fungal infections with antifungal medications. Viruses often only require supportive care. This may entail fluid therapy and hospitalization if your cat has had prolonged or protracted diarrhea and has become dehydrated.

If your cat has ingested a string or another foreign body, surgery may be needed.

Diet trials are often helpful for cats with suspected food allergies. Special diets have novel (new) proteins or hydrolyzed proteins that are broken down to be so small that they don’t trigger an allergic response.

For example, Blue Buffalo® NP is made with alligator meat and Hill’s® Food Sensitivities d/d is made with venison, both novel protein diets. Hill’s® z/d and Royal Canin® HP are examples of hydrolyzed protein diets.

Cats affected by inflammatory bowel disease or GI lymphoma are often prescribed steroid medications to reduce inflammation in the bowel. Your veterinarian may also talk to you about vitamin B12 injections, as most affected cats are unable to properly absorb this vitamin from their diet.

If your cat has a rectal prolapse, it will need to be surgically replaced.

Recovery and Management of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
Recovery from rectal and anal inflammation is usually quick, following appropriate treatment. If your cat is undergoing treatment for colitis proctitis, closely watch all intake and their bowel movements for any abnormalities.

Contact your veterinarian if your cat has persistent diarrhea despite treatment, or if they stop eating, become lethargic, or begin vomiting.

Probiotics may be helpful if your cat had diarrhea caused by rectal or anal inflammation.

There’s always bacteria in stool, but GI disturbances can lead to an imbalance in normal, healthy bacteria in the gut. Probiotics may be helpful in some patients to restore healthy gastrointestinal flora. Products like Purina® FortiFlora and Nutramax® Proviable are good probiotic options.

Prevention of Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats
While some causes of rectal and anal inflammation are unavoidable, some conditions are.

Try to keep your cat from eating anything that is potentially harmful, such as foreign objects, rodents and other hunted prey, and human food. Keeping your cat indoors and avoiding exposure to community cats can reduce their risk of infectious disease.

If your cat does develop diarrhea, be sure to get them in to see their regular veterinarian within a day or two, rather than wait it out. Persistent diarrhea and straining can lead to secondary rectal prolapse and proctitis.
Rectal and Anal Inflammation in Cats FAQs What does rectal prolapse look like in a cat?Rectal prolapse looks like pink tissue protruding from the anus. Sometimes it’s just a small amount of fluffy pink tissue and other times you may see a tubular protrusion of fleshy pink tissue that extends several centimeters to inches. The tissue may be raw and readily bleed when bumped or dragged across surfaces, like carpet.
What are home remedies for swollen anus in cats?A cool compress may be beneficial for an inflamed anus. Consider taking a soft washcloth, running it under cool water, and wringing it out. Alternatively, place the wet washcloth in the refrigerator for an hour prior to gently applying it to your cat’s backside, if tolerated.
Why is my kitten’s anus protruding?If your cat’s anus is red and protruding, it may be inflamed. This may occur secondary to diarrhea or irritation if your cat is licking their backside a lot. If pink tissue is sticking out of the anus, they may be suffering from a rectal prolapse.

156,Rat Poisoning in Cats,"What Is Rat Poisoning in Cats?
If your cat has eaten any type of bait used to control rodent infestation, it is important that you seek veterinary attention immediately.

There are various types of rat baits sold in stores. Symptoms shown by cats who consume rat poison, and veterinary treatment plans, differ depending on the type of bait ingested.

Types of Rodenticides

Anticoagulant rodenticides function by interfering with vitamin K recycling in the body, which ultimately leads to a bleeding condition called coagulopathy. There are multiple types of compounds in this category, which are further divided into first- and second-generation anticoagulants.

Bromethalin is a neurological toxin that causes brain swelling, loss of normal brain function, and death.

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) causes calcium to be held in the body and leads to high blood calcium and mineralization of tissues in the kidneys, lungs, heart, and blood vessels.

It is often difficult to figure out the amount of rat bait your cat has ingested. Therefore, consider ANY possible contact or ingestion of rodent bait by a cat toxic exposure, and seek veterinary attention immediately.

Symptoms of Rat Poisoning in Cats
Anticoagulant rodenticide: Clinical signs may not occur until several days or even weeks after ingestion. Signs may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Bruising (on the skin, gums, whites of the eyes)
	
	
	Black stool
	
	
	Vomiting up blood
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Swelling of the joints
	
	
	Blood in the urine
	


Bromethalin: Signs noted with toxicity depend on the amount your cat ingested. If a large amount, symptoms usually begin within a few hours. These may include muscle tremors, hyperthermia (high body temperature), seizures, or death.

If a small amount of bait is eaten, signs may not be noted for 1 to 4 days after ingestion. Usually, your cat will show signs of weakness and incoordination of the limbs, muscle tremors, paralysis, or cranial nerve abnormalities such as unequal pupil sizes or abnormal eye movements.

Vitamin D3: Clinical signs can be seen even at low exposure doses. A cat may become lethargic, start vomiting, drink more water than normal, have a higher volume of urine than normal, and have seizures. Death is possible.

Causes of Rat Poisoning in Cats
Rat poisoning occurs when cats come into contact with or consume rat bait or traps, or when a cat hunts and eats a rodent that has ingested the bait. Pet parents may see their cats consuming the bait or they may see evidence that a trap or bait has been tampered with, and suspect their cat got into it.

What Happens if a Cat Eats a Rat That Has Been Poisoned?

Relay toxicosis, where a cat eats a rodent that has consumed bait, can occur. Cats that eat multiple rodents over time could be at higher risk for toxicity because the toxin can build up in tissues. Anticoagulant and vitamin D3 poisons are stored in the liver of the rodent that ingests them. As a result, the more bait ingested by a rodent over time means a higher dose of toxin exposure for a feline hunter.

Alternatively, with bromethalin-containing baits, only a small amount needs to be ingested by a rodent to cause the rodent’s death. A larger amount needs to be ingested by a cat to see signs of toxicity. Therefore, a cat eating a rodent who consumed a bromethalin bait is not likely to die from it.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Rat Poisoning in Cats
Most often, veterinarians diagnose rodenticide poisoning based on a client history of seeing an exposure.

When arriving at the hospital, a veterinarian will ask what type of rat poison your cat was exposed to, how much, and how long ago. Bring the package of rat bait with you if possible. Since there are multiple types of rat poison and treatment varies depending on the type of bait ingested, it is important to come with as much information as possible.

Based on the type of bait your cat ingested or was exposed to, your veterinarian will most likely recommend baseline lab work, including a complete blood count and chemistries to check liver, kidneys, and electrolytes.

Anticoagulant rodenticide: If it has been a long enough time after exposure to this type of rodenticide, there may be evidence of bleeding (anemia) and prolonged coagulation times. If the cat is treated immediately after exposure, lab work may not be done initially; instead, it will be done at the end of the vitamin K treatment period.

Bromethalin: A specific diagnostic test is typically unhelpful. General lab work, including a complete blood count and chemistries may be performed.

Vitamin D3: A complete blood count and chemistries are performed. Bloodwork abnormalities include high blood calcium and phosphorus levels and elevated kidney values.

Unfortunately, there is no one superior “rat bait test.” Diagnosis of rat bait toxicity is made based on a combination of history, physical exam findings, and lab work.

Treatment of Rat Poisoning in Cats
Immediate treatment after ingestion or exposure to rat poison provides the best possible outcome, so you must take your cat to the veterinarian right away.

Giving hydrogen peroxide orally to induce vomiting is not advised, as the dose needed to cause vomiting can cause severe stomach swelling. Only a veterinarian should induce vomiting in a cat.

Decontamination is performed immediately at the veterinary clinic. Vomiting is induced using special medication. Once the veterinarian is satisfied with what the cat vomits up, medication will be given to cease further vomiting. Activated charcoal may be given to bind any possible toxin in the gastrointestinal tract of the cat so it can be eliminated from the body in the feces.

Anticoagulant rodenticide: If a cat gets to the vet immediately after exposure, he is likely not to be showing any signs of toxicity. Decontamination will be performed. The patient is usually treated on an outpatient basis with vitamin K and will have coagulation time and lab rechecked after treatment. The length of vitamin K treatment needed depends on the type of anticoagulant rodenticide ingested. Treatment for first-generation products, which are less toxic, is about 10 days, and for second-generation products it can be up to 4 weeks.

Once a cat is showing signs of bleeding, vitamin K alone will not be effective. The cat at this point it critically ill. Plasma transfusion to correct deficiencies in coagulation factors, a blood transfusion, and/or oxygen therapy may be needed. A cat in this state needs 24-hour care and may die despite the most intensive treatment.

Bromethalin: Treatment is supportive, as no antidote is available. Decontamination is performed, and multiple doses of activated charcoal may be given. Other medications include:


	
	Muscle relaxers to treat tremors
	
	
	Diuretics to reduce brain swelling
	
	
	Anti-seizure medications to control seizures
	
	
	Intravenous lipid emulsion to help eliminate the toxin from the body
	


Depending on the amount of exposure to the poison, treatment may vary.

Vitamin D3: Treatment is largely supportive, as there is no antidote. Intravenous fluids, intravenous lipid emulsion (early after exposure), and medications to help rid the body of excess calcium can be given. Bloodwork will be monitored over time to observe response to treatment. Prognosis is unclear once a cat is showing clinical signs, as kidneys and other tissues have already been damaged.

Recovery and Management of Rat Poisoning in Cats
In general, the sooner a cat is treated after toxin ingestion, the higher the likelihood is for a positive outcome. Depending on the toxin and the length of time that has passed since ingestion, the cat may be able to go home the same day with treatment or may be hospitalized for several days to a couple of weeks.

If toxicity is not addressed immediately, the damage caused by the toxin may not be reversible. The cat may develop lifelong health problems or even die.

Prevention of Rat Poisoning in Cats

The best way to decrease the risk of exposure to rat poison is to avoid having any poison around your home. Consider using pet-safe products to eliminate rodents. If you must use a product containing a toxin, block off pet access to bait stations.

Cats that are avid hunters are at a high risk for relay toxicosis by eating rats that have eaten toxins. Again, consider pet-safe alternatives or prevent access to rats by keeping your cat indoors and preventing access to a space where rats have been seen.

Types of Rodenticides

Anticoagulant rodenticides function by interfering with vitamin K recycling in the body, which ultimately leads to a bleeding condition called coagulopathy. There are multiple types of compounds in this category, which are further divided into first- and second-generation anticoagulants.

Bromethalin is a neurological toxin that causes brain swelling, loss of normal brain function, and death.

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) causes calcium to be held in the body and leads to high blood calcium and mineralization of tissues in the kidneys, lungs, heart, and blood vessels.

It is often difficult to figure out the amount of rat bait your cat has ingested. Therefore, consider ANY possible contact or ingestion of rodent bait by a cat toxic exposure, and seek veterinary attention immediately.

Symptoms of Rat Poisoning in Cats
Anticoagulant rodenticide: Clinical signs may not occur until several days or even weeks after ingestion. Signs may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Bruising (on the skin, gums, whites of the eyes)
	
	
	Black stool
	
	
	Vomiting up blood
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Swelling of the joints
	
	
	Blood in the urine
	


Bromethalin: Signs noted with toxicity depend on the amount your cat ingested. If a large amount, symptoms usually begin within a few hours. These may include muscle tremors, hyperthermia (high body temperature), seizures, or death.

If a small amount of bait is eaten, signs may not be noted for 1 to 4 days after ingestion. Usually, your cat will show signs of weakness and incoordination of the limbs, muscle tremors, paralysis, or cranial nerve abnormalities such as unequal pupil sizes or abnormal eye movements.

Vitamin D3: Clinical signs can be seen even at low exposure doses. A cat may become lethargic, start vomiting, drink more water than normal, have a higher volume of urine than normal, and have seizures. Death is possible.

157,Rapid Heart Rate in Cats,"Sinus Tachycardia in Cats
 
Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (i.e., the automatic impulses of the system that control such actions as breathing and heart rate). Sinus tachycardia (ST) is clinically described as a sinus rhythm (heartbeat) with impulses that arise at a faster-than-normal rate: greater than 240 beats per minute in cats.
 
Severe tachycardia can compromise cardiac output, as too rapid rates shorten the diastolic filling time, the point in which the chambers of the heart dilate and fill with blood -- which occurs in the space between heart beats. Particularly in diseased hearts, the increased heart rate can fail to compensate for decreased volume, resulting in decreased cardiac output, decreased coronary blood flow and a concurrent increase in oxygen demands. This is the most common benign arrhythmia in cats. It is also the most common rhythm disturbance in postoperative patients. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Often      no clinical signs because condition is a compensatory response to a      variety of stresses
    If      associated with primary cardiac disease, weakness, exercise intolerance,      or loss of consciousness may be reported
    Pale      mucous membranes if associated with anemia or congestive heart failure
    Fever      may be present
    Signs      of congestive heart failure, such as shortness of breath, cough, and pale      mucous membranes may be present when ST is associated with primary cardiac      disease

Diagnosis
 
Because there are so many things that can cause this condition, it is difficult to diagnose and differentiate from other similar diseases. Your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by a deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you have provided and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, which may show infections of the blood or disorders of the organs (e.g., heart, kidneys). 
 
Your doctor may also order chest X-rays to look for possible evidence of primary cardiac disease or tumors. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) is essential for evaluating the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), and may show structural cardiac diseases that are affecting the heart. Ultrasound and angiography are also very useful for evaluating adrenal masses. Your doctor may also conduct a thyroid scan to evaluate your cat for hyperthyroidism. If the tachycardia is found to be related to congestive heart failure, the prognosis is generally poor, even with treatment.
 
Treatment
 
Your veterinarian will develop a treatment plan for your cat once a diagnosis has been confirmed. If there is an underlying cause, that will be the primary focus of treatment. For infections, antibiotics will be administered, and for dehydration, your cat will be given fluid therapy until the body fluids have stabilized. Digoxin may be prescribed for cases of chronic hyperthyroidism.
 
Living and Management
 
The care of your cat following diagnosis will depend on the specific disease that is found to be causing the sinus tachycardia. Restricting your cat’s activity so that its heart rate does not increase excessively may be called for, but only if your cat’s health is being adversely affected by the increased heart rate."," and Types

158,Rapid Heart Rate in Cats,"What Is Rapid Heart Rate in Cats?
Cats normally have a much higher heart rate than humans to fit their high activity levels and small size. A rapid heart rate in cats, called sinus tachycardia, is when a cat’s heart rate is greater than 180 beats per minute.

Most commonly seen when cats are stressed, sinus tachycardia may also occur when they are in pain, when the heart is struggling to function properly (such as when there is blood loss, shock, or heart failure) or with diseases like hyperthyroidism and asthma.

Sinus tachycardia is extremely common for cats to experience at the vet, as they are often stressed or may be in pain. Rapid heart rate in cats while at home is much more concerning, though it can be hard for pet parents to notice when it happens.

Most cats will not show any outward signs of sinus tachycardia, but if you notice symptoms like rapid breathing, panting, vocalizing, or weakness with a rapid heart rate, take your cat to the vet immediately.  While rapid heart rate on its own is not usually life-threatening, conditions that cause it can be.

Symptoms of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
Symptoms of rapid heart rate in cats include:


        
        Heart rate exceeding 180 beats per minute
        
        
        Panting
        
        
        Lethargy and weakness
        
        
        Decreased appetite
        
        
        Loud vocalizations
        


Causes of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
The causes of rapid heart rate in cats are almost always associated with an underlying disease, stress, or pain.

Trauma, blood loss, shock, and heart failure can increase a cat’s heart rate as the body tries to improve poor blood flow. A cat’s heart rate may also rise due to respiratory illness like asthma or pneumonia as the body tries to compensate for lower oxygen levels.

Hyperthyroidism is commonly linked with sinus tachycardia in both humans and cats as a direct response to the increase in the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine.

Sinus tachycardia can be seen in any age, sex, or breed of cat.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
Rapid heart rate in cats is normally diagnosed during a physical exam by your veterinarian and is usually related to the stress of the vet visit. If there is concern due to other findings or abnormal behaviors noted at home, your vet may recommend a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry, urinalysis, and thyroid testing to look for contributing factors.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) can help verify that this is sinus tachycardia and not another type of arrhythmia that leads to high heart rate. Radiographs, ultrasound, and echocardiogram may also be recommended to help diagnose the cause of the high heart rate.

Treatment of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
A rapid heart rate in cats is rarely, if ever, treated directly. Most treatments will be aimed at the underlying cause as determined by your veterinarian. Stress at the veterinary hospital may be managed with medications like gabapentin or pheromones.
Mentioned in this ArticleFeliway  Classic Calming Spray for Cats, 60-mLRated 0 out of 5 stars0Reviews$20.00Chewy PriceShop on ChewySome causes of rapid heart rate in cats can be managed at home, while others may require hospitalization and even surgery. Your vet will help guide you through treatment and prognosis based on your cat’s test results.

Recovery and Management of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
Recovery from rapid heart rate in cats depends on the underlying cause. Stressed cats will usually recover well once they are home in a more secure environment.

Hyperthyroidism, joint pain, and asthma usually respond well on an outpatient basis to oral medications and routine follow-up.

Severe trauma may require hospitalization and intensive care.

Primary heart disease often requires close management with your veterinarian and frequent follow-ups to monitor heart function and rhythm.

Monitoring a cat’s heart rate at home is rarely needed. Instead, pet parents should focus on their cat’s breathing, appetite, and behavior to make sure they’re recovering well.

Prevention of Rapid Heart Rate in Cats
To prevent the most common cause of rapid heart rate in cats, try to make vet visits and travel as stress-free as possible. Leave your cat carrier in active parts of your home to allow your cat to get used to it, and encourage them to nap or even eat in their carrier.

Hard-topped carriers that open from the top or can be taken apart easily are best. Ask your vet about medications that may reduce stress during their visits.
Annual vet visits, routine blood work, and vaccinations will help prevent illnesses and injuries that can lead to sinus tachycardia.

159,Raccoon Disease in Cats,"Baylisascariasis in Cats

 
The Baylisascaris procyonis larvae is found in a large part of the animal population, including humans -- making this a zoonotic disease, which means that it can be spread from an infected animal to other animal species, which includes humans. Most commonly called ""raccoon disease"" because of its prevalence in the raccoon population, baylisascariasis comes from contact with raccoon feces, and from ingesting animal tissue that is infected with the B. procyonis parasite. This parasite is commonly referred to as roundworm. Raccoons are the optimal carriers of this worm, since the health of the raccoon is not adversely affected, making it the ideal host and disseminator of the parasite. The B. procyonis larvae is typically spread through the fecal material into the environment. Any contact with the feces, or with soil that has been used by an infected raccoon, may lead to systemic infection. Therefore, it is essential to practice methods of avoidance and caution in areas where raccoons are prevalent.

Intermediate carriers are birds, rabbits, and rodents, amongst other animals. The larva is known to migrate to the brain, where it affects the nervous system. In this weakened state, the small animal becomes an easy catch, and the larva is ingested when the predator animal (i.e., a cat) ingests tissue from the infected animal. This is another way in which the worm is disseminated to other animals.

This disease is known to occur throughout the United States, with reported outbreaks in zoos and on farms. However, an outbreak can occur wherever animals are kept together in large groups.

While this infection can often be treated in adult cats, it is almost always fatal for kittens. In addition, because the worm sometimes attacks the brain and nervous system, this infection may be mistaken for rabies. If rabies is suspected, you may wish to ask your veterinarian to test for the presence of the B. procyonis parasite.

Symptoms and Types

Two types of baylisascariasis have been reported in cats: intestinal infection and visceral disease. The development of the roundworm begins with ingestion of the roundworm eggs. They then migrate to the intestines, where they further develop before their final migration into the viscera (the organs that occupy the abdominal cavities), the nervous system, or the eye. These types of infections are referred to, respectively, as larval migrans; visceral larval migrans (VLM); neural larval migrans (NLM); and ocular larval migrans (OLM).

The intestinal form is most commonly found in adult cats, while infection of internal organs, particularly the brain and spinal cord (visceral disease) is more common in kittens. Often, there are not any outward symptoms associated with early onset of the disease, but occasionally cats will show signs of neurological disease due to the worm attacking the nervous system. Signs of neurological disease (NLM) include:


    Unsteady walking/loss of 	coordination or muscle control (ataxia)
    Difficulty eating/swallowing 	(dysphagia)
    Lethargy, lying down excessively (recumbency)
    Circling
    Seizure
    Confusion, lack of attention


Infection of the viscera (VLM) may present symptoms of liver and/or lung disease, while infection of the eye (OLM) may not be apparent until your cat has lost the use of its vision.

Causes

The most common method of acquiring the infection  originates from sharing an area with infected raccoons. A cat can become infected with the disease from coming into contact with raccoon feces, from ingestion of  B. procyonis eggs, which may remain viable in the soil long after the raccoon feces has disintegrated or been removed, from ingestion of animal tissue that is infected with the roundworm (e.g., rabbits, birds, etc.), or from close contact with other infected animals. Because cats frequently scratch at dirt after urinating or defecating onto it, a cat may pick up roundworm eggs on its paws and ingest the eggs while self grooming.

Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected. Knowing the path the parasite has taken is essential for treating the infection appropriately.

The intestinal form of baylisascariasis is found by examining the cat's feces, while the larval form may be found in association with other diseases such as rabies, canine distemper, and congenital neurological defects. A direct fecal smear test will detect the intestinal form of the disease, while the larval form can usually be found through an eye (ophthalmoscopic) examination, or by a laboratory examination of a tissue sample.



Treatment

If your cat tests positive for this parasite, there are several medications that can be administered.

For the intestinal form:


    Pyrantel Pamoate
    Febantel
    Praziquantel
    Ivermectin
    Mibemycin Oxime


For the larval form:


    Corticosteriods
    Long-term albendazole


Living and Management

A follow-up visit is recommended two weeks after the initial treatment, in order to analyze the feces for worms, and then again after a month to check for the intestinal form of the disease. This is a zoonotic disease, transmissible to humans and other animals, with children being at the highest risk of acquiring the infection and of suffering the worst effects. Accidental ingestion of roundworm eggs can cause serious disease in humans. Ingestion may occur as a result of playing in sand that has been used by raccoons or other infected animals, from contact with soil that is infected with the eggs, or from contact with infected feces (during the course of cleaning it up or changing the litter box). It is essential to be especially cautious until you have been assured that your cat has entirely recovered from the infection and is no longer shedding the eggs through its feces. Disposable gloves should be worn while changing the litter box and when handling your cat's waste materials. In addition, hygiene regarding the hands and nails will need to be a priority if you live in an area that is occupied by raccoons.

The location where your cat contracted the roundworm should be well observed and monitored, and neighbors should be notified of the risk to their own pets.

Prevention

The most important preventative step is to keep pets away from areas with raccoons and to prevent pets from ingesting animal tissue. Other steps that can be taken to protect your family and pet from this parasite are to keep sand boxes covered, check your property for raccoon droppings and deceased animals, and make sure that your cat or kitten has been dewormed."," and Types

160,Rabies in Cats,"What Is Rabies in Cats?
Rabies is a viral disease that is nearly always fatal in affected animals, including cats. The good news is that you can prevent rabies in your cat with a simple vaccine. It’s always a good idea to ensure your cats are current on their vaccinations.  

Rabies acts by attacking the central nervous system (CNS), spreading through the nervous system until it reaches the brain. Infected animals experience paralysis that inevitably involves the respiratory system and leads to death.  

Rabies can affect any mammal, including humans. Animals that host and spread viruses like rabies are known as reservoirs for the disease. Host reservoirs for rabies include skunks, weasels, and bats. Cats are relatively resistant to the dog rabies variant, but are not considered a reservoir species for the virus.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Cat Rabies
Early symptoms of rabies may be gradual and hard to spot. During the first 2-4 days of infection, your cat may have a fever, less energy than usual, and decreased appetite. Symptoms tend to progress quickly to weakness or paralysis of the legs, seizures, difficulty breathing, hypersalivation (too much saliva) due to difficulty swallowing, and abnormal behavior. Changes in behavior can range from extreme aggression to extreme depression or coma. 

Classical rabies has two forms, paralytic and furious. Cats may show signs of either or both. If the furious phase develops, cats can become aggressive and occasionally delusional. They may seem to hallucinate and attack their surroundings with no trigger. The paralytic phase may also occur, in which patients start to develop paralysis of various muscular systems, and often lose the ability to swallow. This leads to hypersalivation and foaming at the mouth—which some people consider to be a classical sign of rabies virus infection. 

Eventually, coma and death occur after paralysis or prolonged seizure activity. 

Causes of Rabies in Cats
The most common way for a cat to become infected is through a bite from an infected animal where the virus is transmitted by the saliva. Rarely, the saliva or nerve tissue of an infected animal can contaminate a cat’s open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth, leading to transmission of the virus without a bite occurring.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Rabies in Cats
There is no way to definitively diagnose rabies in a living animal, so it’s essential to observe the signs and accurately interpret symptoms. If a vet suspects rabies based on the cat’s symptoms, a diagnosis can be made by testing the brain tissue after the cat has died. The brain tissue is examined using a method called direct fluorescent antibody testing.

Treatment for Rabies in Cats
There is no treatment for rabies in cats, and humane euthanasia is recommended if the disease is strongly suspected. For this reason, it is critical to keep your cat up to date on their rabies vaccine to ensure their health and safety should they become exposed to this disease.

Recovery and Management of Rabies in Cats
Rabies is almost 100% fatal, and there is no hope of recovery or long-term management of the disease once a cat has been infected and has started to show symptoms. It’s critical to take the cat to an emergency vet once symptoms appear or if you suspect a rabies infection.
Rabies in Cats FAQsCan you test for rabies in cats?Yes, but the testing can only be done after death. This is because brain matter is required for accurate diagnosis of the disease, using a method called direct fluorescent antibody testing.
What should I do if my cat has been bitten by a rabid animal?If you suspect that your cat has been exposed to rabies, take them to an emergency vet immediately. Cats that have been vaccinated against rabies can be revaccinated as a preventive measure.
How common is rabies in cats?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that more than 250 cats in the United States are infected with rabies each year.
How long does it take to see signs of rabies in cats?The amount of time between infection and the onset of rabies symptoms is called the incubation period. This ranges from 2-24 weeks, with an average of 4-6 weeks. The length of time depends on how much virus was injected by the bite, how close the bite is to the brain, and whether the cat has been vaccinated.
What are the first signs of rabies in cats?The first signs are changes in behavior, when a cat acts in different ways than they would normally—they can become more outgoing, more reclusive, more aggressive, or mentally dull.
Is there rabies virus in a cat scratch?Rabies is usually transmitted through the saliva, so it is unlikely that rabies could be transmitted through the scratch of an infected cat. Any minimal possibility of spread through a scratch is because scratching is often associated with hissing and biting, which can aerosolize and transmit the virus to another individual.
Does the rabies vaccine prevent a cat from getting rabies?The rabies vaccine can prevent rabies infection. It is considered a core vaccine (one that all cats should receive) and can be administered to a kitten starting at 12 weeks of age. A booster vaccine should then be given in 1 year, and every 1-3 years after.
How long can a cat live if it has rabies?Most cats will die within 10 days of acquiring rabies.

161,Q Fever in Cats,"Bacterial Zoonotic Disease in Cats

Q fever is a disease caused by an infection with Coxiella burnetii, a pathogenic bacterium that is structurally similar to the Rickettsia bacteria but genetically different.

A cat will most commonly become infected with the organism if it ingests infected bodily fluids (i.e., urine, feces, milk, discharges), tissues, or diseased carcasses (e.g., those from cattle, sheep, or goats). The bacteria can also become airborne and is transmittable through fleas or lice, which carry C. burnetii in its parasitic form.

Q fever is an worldwide endemic, affecting cats and dogs of any age, gender, or breed, and as a zoonotic disease, it is transmissible to humans. Care must be taken when dealing with bodily fluids, organs, and/or tissue material of any animal, particularly farm animals. Dispose of all birth remains properly and feed your cat pasteurized products only.

If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Lungs are thought to be the main portal of entry into systemic circulation. C. burnetii will then replicate in the organ's lining, causing widespread vasculitis. Inflammation of the cat's blood vessels will result in the death of its blood cells and hemorrhaging of the lungs, liver, and central nervous system.

Once the cat has contracted the disease it may display some of the following symptoms:


    Fever
    Lethargy
    Anorexia
    Depression
    Miscarriage
    Incoordination
    Seizures (not common in cats)


The types of symptoms your cat displays and the severity of the Q fever will ultimately depend on the particular strain of organism your cat is infected with. Often, animals with C. burnetii will undergo a period of latency (inactivity). However, during the birthing process the bacterium may reactivate, resulting in large numbers of bacteria entering the placenta, and the host's bodily fluids, urine, feces, and milk.

Causes

Exposure to animals infected with C. burnetii (especially those that have just given birth), ticks, fleas, and lice.

Diagnosis

Providing a detailed history of your cat's health and its lifestyle leading up to the onset of the symptoms will assist your veterinarian in the diagnosis.

Your veterinarian will then conduct a complete blood profile on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Once collected, the cat's blood serum will be refrigerated to assist in the identification of the organism's type. The veterinarian will also collect a tissue sample (e.g., from the placenta) and refrigerate it for later use as an inoculator.



Treatment

There are medications that are effective in eliminating the bacterial infection, and your veterinarian will guide you in creating an effective treatment plan for the cat. However, be aware that C. burnetii is more resistant to eradication than other types of Rickettsiae, a similar type of bacteria.

Because of the zoonosis of Q fever, take extreme care when handling infected animals. To lessen the risk of transmitting the disease, your cat should be immediately hospitalized once it is found to have Q fever.

Living and Management

It can be difficult to determine the success of therapy because many animals will spontaneously improve. However, even asymptomatic cases should be aggressively treated because of the potential for human infection.

By the time a diagnosis is made in a cat, human exposure and infection have more than likely occurred. Therefore, anyone who has been in contact with the cat should seek immediate medical attention. The incubation period from the time of contact until the first signs of illness is 5 to 32 days.

Humans typically contract the disease by inhaling infected aerosols (i.e., airborne material), especially after an animal has given birth; children are commonly infected from ingesting raw dairy milk, but are usually asymptomatic. Person-to-person transmission is possible but rare."," and Types

Lungs are thought to be the main portal of entry into systemic circulation. C. burnetii will then replicate in the organ's lining, causing widespread vasculitis. Inflammation of the cat's blood vessels will result in the death of its blood cells and hemorrhaging of the lungs, liver, and central nervous system.

Once the cat has contracted the disease it may display some of the following symptoms:


    Fever
    Lethargy
    Anorexia
    Depression
    Miscarriage
    Incoordination
    Seizures (not common in cats)


The types of symptoms your cat displays and the severity of the Q fever will ultimately depend on the particular strain of organism your cat is infected with. Often, animals with C. burnetii will undergo a period of latency (inactivity). However, during the birthing process the bacterium may reactivate, resulting in large numbers of bacteria entering the placenta, and the host's bodily fluids, urine, feces, and milk.

162,Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency in Cats,"A deficiency in the enzyme Pyruvate Kinase (PK) impairs the red blood cells' (RBCs) ability to metabolize, which in turn may cause anemia and other blood-related issues. Breeds more prone to PK deficiency include the Abyssinian, Somali, and domestic shorthair cats.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Anemia
	Weakness
	Muscle wasting
	Jaundice (rare)
	Pale mucous membranes
	Elevated heart rate (tachycardia)
	Inability to perform routine exercises


 

Causes

 

PK definciency is typically associated with a genetic defect acquired at birth.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC).

 

Blood testing may reveal an increased number of platelets as well as white blood cells (leukocytosis), anemia with abnormally large, pale red blood cells (RBCs),  abnormally-shaped RBCs called poikilocytes (poikilcytosis), and a variation in RBC color (polychromasia). The biochemistry profile, meanwhile, may show an excess of iron in the blood (hyperferremia), mild increase in bilirubin, and slight increase in liver enzymes. Lastly, urinalysis may reveal high levels of bilirubin.





 

Treatment

 

Bone marrow transplantation is the only available treatment for PK deficient cats. However, this treatment is expensive and potentially life-threatening.

 

Living and Management

 

Cats that undergo a bone marrow transplant may have a normal lifespan. Unfortunately, those that are left untreated will typically die by four years of age as a result of bone marrow or liver failure. Most of these patients develop severe anemia and accumulation of fluid in abdominal cavity (ascites) during the terminal stage of the disease.

163,Pyometra in Cats,"What is Pyometra in Cats?
Pyometra is an infection in the uterus. The term stems from the Latin words “pyo” (which means pus) and “metra” (which means uterus or womb). Translated, it means pus in the uterus. This condition occurs more frequently in older, unspayed female cats that have had several heat cycles in their lives without getting pregnant. Pyometra most commonly occurs in cats that have been in heat within the past month.  

When a cat is ready to mate and have kittens, she goes into “heat.” Heat is a term describing hormone changes inside the female animal’s body that makes them more receptive to getting pregnant. During this phase, your cat may be excessively vocal (yowling often) or stick her rear end up in the air. Following a heat cycle, hormones change, making it easier for bacteria to enter the uterus, grow and cause an infection.  

While pyometra is an uncommon condition in cats it can be life-threatening and requires emergency medical treatment.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Pyometra in Cats
The symptoms of pyometra can vary from subtle (almost unnoticeable) to severe lethargy, vomiting and weakness. Symptoms vary greatly because of a female cat’s opening from the vagina to the uterus called the cervix. This part of the body opens, or dilates, during labor and delivery, as well as during heat. It then closes following heat (or after a cat gives birth). If the cervix is still open, when pyometra develops, the pus can drain out of the body. Cats with an open cervix, or “open pyometra,” are much less sick than those with a closed cervix, “closed pyometra.”  

When the cervix is closed, it traps the pus inside the uterus which can result in the pet becoming septic and toxic shock developing quickly.  

Common signs of pyometra include:  


	
	Pus draining from the vulva: This can be difficult to spot because cats are very meticulous about grooming. Watch for any drainage around the base of the tail or on bedding.  
	
	
	Lethargy, depression, or weakness 
	
	
	Anorexia or decreased appetite 
	
	
	Increased thirst 
	



	
	Vomit or diarrhea 
	
	
	Fever 
	


Causes of Pyometra in Cats
Pyometra occurs in older intact female cats who have never given birth. This is because when a cat undergoes a heat cycle, several hormonal changes occur inside her uterus including thickening of the uterus walls. These changes are meant to prepare her body for pregnancy. Chronic thickening of the uterus walls without pregnancy may lead to a cyst forming in the walls of the uterus. Uterine cysts release fluid that feeds bacteria.  

The cat’s cervix also opens to allow sperm to enter. Meanwhile, her white blood cells that usually protect her from infection, are prevented from the uterus to protect the sperm. Unfortunately, this also protects bacteria, allowing it to rapidly multiply and grow in the uterus. As bacteria grows, pus accumulates and causes pyometra in cats.  

Rarely, a spayed cat may develop a pyometra, which is called a “stump pyometra.” When a female cat is spayed, her entire reproductive tract is removed, including the ovaries and the uterus. A stump pyometra occurs when an infection happens in the small amount of tissue (‘stump’) left behind after a spay is completed. This is very uncommon in cats.  

How Veterinarians Diagnose Pyometra in Cats
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough exam and review your cat’s health history. The veterinarian may ask the date of your cat’s last heat cycle and about any unusual behaviors at home including excessive drinking, wet spots, or discharge on your cat’s bedding.  

Your veterinarian will also perform tests, which may include: 


	
	X-rays  
	
	
	Blood work  
	



	
	Urinalysis 
	


Diagnosing a pyometra in cats can be challenging when it is an open pyometra. Your vet may perform an ultrasound because this technique is more sensitive than x-ray and can detect changes in uterine size.  

Treatment of Pyometra in Cats
Pyometra in cats is most commonly treated by spaying the animal and removing the source of the infection. This involves surgically removing both the ovaries and the uterus.  

Surgically removing the entire infected uterus is the preferred treatment for pyometra, but there are possible alternatives that may potentially be used to treat cats that pet parents are planning to breed in the future.  

These alternate treatments are less reliable and carry more risks, but may be an option for breeding cats. One option is administering prostaglandins, a type of hormone, that induce uterine contractions and open the cervix. This may help expel the bacteria and be managed with antibiotics after the procedure.  

Recovery and Management of Pyometra in Cats
Routine spay surgeries typically require very little hospitalization time however, cats who undergo surgery to treat a pyometra are often quite sick. They typically stay in the hospital on IV fluids for a few days following surgery. Recovery time may vary depending on how sick the pet is prior to surgery.  

Following surgery, limit your cat's activity for about 2 weeks to allow time to completely heal. During this time, your cat should not run or jump, and may require being kept in a large crate that has room for her litter box and water bowl.  

You should also regularly check her incision for excessive redness or drainage. To prevent her from licking or chewing at her incision, she may require an E-Collar (plastic or cloth cone). She will likely require oral antibiotics; however your veterinarian may be able to administer a long-acting antibiotic instead. Please be sure to follow your veterinarian’s instructions and do not discontinue her antibiotic before the medication course is completed.   
Pyometra in Cats FAQsHow does pyometra occur?Pyometra occurs in older, intact female cats that have undergone multiple heat cycles without getting pregnant. It occurs when hormone changes make the uterus more susceptible to bacterial infections. Following these chronic changes, bacteria travels into the uterus from the vulva and replicates, forming pus. This pus makes the pet feel sick as their immune system struggles to fight the bacteria.
When does pyometra occur?Pyometra most commonly occurs in cats that have had a heat cycle in the past 4 weeks.
What happens if pyometra goes untreated?If left untreated, a pet with pyometra may become septic as the bacteria travels from the uterus into the bloodstream. This can result in toxic shock, and even death.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected.

Urinalysis will be used to determine the cause of the symptoms, if possible, before using more invasive procedures. Your doctor may also do a microscopic examination of urinary sediment, prostatic fluid, urethral or vaginal discharges, or biopsy specimens, which will be obtained either by catheter, or by needle aspiration. A survey by abdominal x-ray and ultrasound imaging also may be used if your veterinarian has not been able to settle on a conclusive diagnosis.

Treatment

Treatment varies depending on the underlying cause and the specific organs involved.

Your veterinarian will set up a schedule with you so that your cat's progress can be followed. Further urinalyses tests will show whether the treatment is working. If the expected benefit outweighs the risk of introducing bacteria into the urinary tract, your veterinarian will most likely settle on a catheter for withdrawing the urine samples. If the benefit does not outweigh the risk, and if your cat is already ill from an infection or otherwise, your doctor will probably collect urine specimens using a more sterile method in order to avoid contamination, such as by direct fine needle aspiration from the bladder. Infectious and noninfectious inflammatory disorders of the urinary tract can cause primary renal (kidney) failure, urinary obstruction, blood poisoning, and even death.","

165,Pus in the Chest Cavity of Cats,"Pyothorax in Cats

Pyothorax occurs when pus, the body's natural immune response to an invasion of bacteria, accumulates in the chest (pleural) cavity. Made up of white blood cells (neutrophils) and dead cells, pus gathers at the site of an infection. Eventually, the white blood cells die, leaving the thick whitish-yellow fluid that is characteristic of pus.

Pus that accumulates in the chest cavity, however, differs from an abscess, in that it does not create an enclosed wall of tissue to inhibit the bacteria from spreading. Instead, the pus forms into sacs that line the pleura, eventually scarring the cavity and severely impairing lung function.

A bacterial infection that settles in the cat's chest cavity can enter from the lungs or esophagus. Cats generally get these types of infections from bite wounds, but they can also get them from inhaling foreign bodies, or from the spread of a lung infection, such as pneumonia, into the chest cavity.

The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how pyrothorax affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Cats with pyothorax commonly display such symptoms as shock and sudden respiratory distress; they may also collapse.

Causes

The most common causes for pyrothorax include infections with the bacteria:


    Pasteurella 	Multocida
    Bacteroides
    Peptostreptococcus
    Fusobacterium


Other causes include:


    Cancer
    Parasitic 	infestation (e.g., Spirocerca lupi)
    Lung 	torsion (twisting of a lung lobe)
    The 	presence of foreign objects within the chest cavity
    Rupture 	of inflamed, granulated tumor in the esophagus


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health to the veterinarian, as well as its symptoms and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as any fight wounds or chest injuries your pet might have sustained.

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, checking your cat’s chest for inflammation of cellular tissue (cellulites) or scarring. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, electrolyte panel. In addition, a urinalysis sample of fluid from the chest cavity will be sent to the laboratory for cytologic (microscopic) evaluation and gram staining -- a procedure that makes bacteria more visible by causing it to stand out from the other cells.



A sample of the fluid in the pleural cavity will be sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures (bacteria that need oxygen, and bacteria that does not, respectively), and for serological testing to detect the presence of a fungal agent. If the parasite S. lupi  is suspected, an examination of the esophagus (esophagoscopy) can be done.

Your veterinarian can also use X-ray and ultrasound imaging to examine the interior of the cat's chest cavity. These images will show fluid in the chest cavity, possible lung hardening (consolidation), lung collapse, and/or masses.

Treatment

Cats with this condition should be hospitalized in the intensive care unit for treatment. It may take several days to weeks to fully eradicate the infection.  Drainage of the chest cavity through a tube is critical; otherwise, the condition cannot be resolved. The chest cavity will be rinsed out (through the chest tube) every six to eight hours with warm, sterile saline.

Coupage -- a technique that involves rapidly slapping the chest wall, but not with enough force to injure the animal -- may help remove debris from the chest cavity. A bacterial culture will be repeated if your cat's condition does not improve.

The infected cat should be encouraged to lightly exercise -- 10 minutes every six to eight hours -- to promote breathing and speed up the recovery process. If there are abscesses in the lungs, stiffening of the lining of the chest cavity, lung-lobe twisting, extensive clumping of pustules, or if the mediastinum is involved, surgery will be indicated.

Surgery will also be necessary for removing a foreign body if your veterinarian can find it on X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

If your veterinarian chooses to perform a thoracotomy, your pet will be treated with pain medication following the procedure, and antibiotics to prevent infection from the incision. The type of antibiotics may be changed depending on the results of the culture and sensitivity tests.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-up appointments for your pet after it is discharged from the hospital, including complete blood counts and X-rays to follow its progress. While there may be some lung damage remaining in the chest cavity, resulting from the pus formations, fluid should be absent.

An antibiotic regimen should be continued for at least a month after the infection has cleared, or when the blood work results are normal or there is no evidence of fluid re-accumulation on the cat's X-ray. This antibiotic treatment regimen is generally between 3 to 12 months, although it may take longer.

The prognosis is fair to excellent with continuous antibiotic therapy and sufficient drainage of the chest cavity. Your cat’s exercise level can gradually be returned to normal over a period of two to four months."," and Types

Cats with pyothorax commonly display such symptoms as shock and sudden respiratory distress; they may also collapse.

166,Protozoan Infection (Trichomoniasis) in Cats,"Trichomoniasisin Cats



The protozoa are single-celled microorganisms belonging to the kingdom Protista, which includes several other single celled microorganisms. The protozoa stand out for their animalistic behavior, in that they are able to move from place to place on their own, and consume organic matter as a source of energy, as animals do.



Some protozoa have been discovered to be harmful to animals and humans, taking on a parasitic form and infecting a host animal. Trichomoniasis is a disease caused by a type of anaerobic (capable of living without oxygen) protozoan called trichomonas. Normally inhabiting the large intestine, Trichomonas cause inflammation of the large bowel.



Young cats under the age of one year are most disposed to this infection. Although it is very unlikely to be passed to humans or dogs, care must be taken to prevent the spread of this infection to other cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Intermittent diarrhea
	Diarrhea may contain blood and mucus
	Swelling and redness of the anus
	Pain in the anal area
	Protrusion of the rectum through the anus in severe cases




Causes



Protozoan infection



Diagnosis



You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical exam on your cat. Standard laboratory work will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, a fecal analysis, and a urinalysis in order to determine the exact origin of the symptoms and the exact organism responsible. The laboratory test results are often within normal range in affected cats, except for the derangements related to the diarrhea.



If your cat is unable to produce a fecal sample, another method for taking a sample is by a fecal swab, by which a cotton swab is inserted into the anus to collect a sufficient amount for analysis. The parasite, if it is present, will be obvious under a microscope by its characteristic tails, and will differentiate it from other parasitic forms. This type of fecal culture can also be used to grow the parasite for confirmatory diagnosis.



A more specific and advanced test called PCR (polymerase chain reaction) may also be available for the confirmatory diagnosis. This is the best test for confirming, since it is more sensitive and will show the presence of the genetic material that makes up the trichomonas organism. Whether this test can be used for diagnostic purposed will depend on whether your veterinarian has fast access to a laboratory that can perform the analysis.







Treatment



The disease may resolve on its own in some animals, but generally, treatment is needed for the successful eradication of the infection.



Living and Management



A relapses of diarrhea is common, even when appropriate therapy is employed. It is important to consider that stress, travel, dietary changes, and treatments for other conditions may lead to a relapse of this disease.



While trichomonas has not been found to be transmissible to humans, thus far, the same precautions should be taken as with any disease that is capable of contagion. Wearing disposable gloves while changing the litter box, and cleaning the hands and surrounding area thoroughly and regularly are standard recommendations. In addition, cat owners who are immune compromised should avoid cleaning the litter box at all.

167,Prostate Inflammation (Prostatitis) in Cats,"What Is Prostate Gland Inflammation (Prostatitis) in Cats?
The prostate gland in male cats is located behind the bladder and is part of the male reproductive system. It covers the top and sides of the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder through the penis to outside of the body). While not required for sperm production, the prostate gland produces fluid needed in semen, nourishes the sperm cells, and improves their movement. The colon also runs along the top of the prostate gland.

Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland and causes its enlargement. Enlargement of the gland compresses the urethra and colon, causing symptoms.

Prostatitis is rare in cats and is divided into two categories:


	
	Acute prostatitis—the result of a sudden onset of a bacterial infection.
	
	
	Chronic prostatitis—the result of an untreated or undetected infection.

Acute Prostatitis:


	
	Straining to urinate or defecate
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Painful abdomen when touched or lying down
	
	
	Bloody discharge from the penis
	
	
	Stiff walking pattern
	


Chronic Prostatitis:


	
	Straining to defecate or no stool production
	
	
	Dribbling urine
	
	
	Vocalizing when attempting to urinate
	
	
	Discharge of blood or pus from the penis (even without urine)
	

Causes of Prostatitis in Cats
Although not known for certain, it is suspected that prostatitis starts from a bacterial infection in the urine or bladder, and is transferred to the prostate because of their close proximity and connecting tubes. In some cases, that infection can progress to a prostate gland abscess (a pus-filled sac on the prostate gland) that may rupture, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.

Other risks factors for developing an enlarged prostate gland are functional testicles (in an intact, non-neutered cat), history of receiving hormones (for treating chronic conditions and some behavior problems), and a compromised immune system.

The factors that predispose a cat to a urinary tract infection also predispose them to prostatitis, including:


	
	 Bladder crystals or stones
	
	
	 Feline lower urinary tract diseases (FLUTD)
	
	
	•Cancer in the urinary tract
	
	
	•Injuries to the urinary tract• Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), where male hormones cause increased cell production, resulting in enlargement of the prostate
	


All male cats are susceptible to prostatitis. Fortunately, prostate gland cancer in cats is rare. When it does occur it typically progresses very quickly.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Prostatitis in Cats
To diagnose prostatitis, a veterinarian will first perform a thorough exam, then work to rule out other common causes of similar symptoms. Tests are based on the physical exam findings, the cat’s history, and previous test results. Tests that may be recommended include:


	
	Urinalysis: To determine the presence of a urinary tract infection, identify suspicion of cancer, and highlight kidney function.
	
	
	Blood work: To determine kidney function and identify changes in hydration and red and white blood cell concentration.
	
	
	Rectal exam, X-rays: To check for enlargement of the prostate gland.
	
	
	Prostatic wash and cytology: To collect a sample that is analyzed for abnormal cells and infectious agents.
	
	
	Biopsy: To differentiate between BPH, prostate gland cancer, and prostatitis—though obtaining a sample is not always possible.
	
	
	Urine Culture: To determine the exact bacterial organism and the appropriate antibiotic if an infection is present.
	

Treatment of Prostate Gland Inflammation (Prostatitis) in Cats
For unneutered male cats, neutering is recommended to reduce the hormonal component of the disease. Antibiotics are used to treat infections. Selection of the most effective antibiotic is based on the urine culture results.

Short-term use of an anti-inflammatory medication (such as Onsior®, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone acetate) may be needed to quickly relieve compression of the urethra and colon. However, anti-inflammatory medications are not recommended for long-term use in cats, due to their risk of causing sudden onset kidney failure, heart failure, or death.

Additional care to alleviate urinary straining or spasms or fecal straining (such as stool softeners or stool lubricators) may be recommended.

In severe cases, surgery to redirect the urine flow may be needed. Surgery might also be required to clean the abdomen of material in cases where an abscess on the prostate gland has ruptured.
Recovery and Management of Prostatitis in Cats
Medical treatment of prostatitis can take two to six weeks to fully resolve. Recovery after neutering surgery is seven to 10 days. However, the time it takes to see the effects of the lower hormone levels on the prostate gland can range from six to eight weeks. During that time, cats with prostatitis may still experience symptoms, but as time progresses the symptoms will become less severe.

Cats with a ruptured prostate gland abscess have a longer recovery time and a more guarded prognosis, but recovery is possible. Prostatitis can reoccur even if treated once.
Prostate Gland Inflammation in Cats FAQsIs an inflamed prostate gland in cats a sign of cancer?Not for most cases. Tumors of the prostate gland are extremely rare in cats. If a tumor is present, the symptoms, including bloody urine and straining to urinate or defecate, are usually sudden and progress quickly.
What does an inflamed prostate gland in cats look like?Although you cannot see or feel a prostate through the skin, signs such as straining to urinate or defecate, bloody discharge from the penis, and a stiff-hind-leg walking pattern warrant a visit to your veterinarian.

168,Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Prostatic Adenocarcinoma in Cats

The prostate gland is an important part of the male reproductive system. It contains many valuable and essential enzymes, including calcium and citric acid,and also plays an important role in the protection and motility of sperm. The liquid secreted by the prostate gland aids in the liquefaction of semen after ejaculation, and in the protection of sperm in the vagina.

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland is reported in cats but is relatively rare in this species as compared to dogs. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland originates in the glandular tissue and can grow and  metastasize rapidly to other parts and organs of body. Llike other types of carcinomas, adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland typically affects older cats, usually those that are older than eight years of age.

Symptoms and Types

In adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the symptoms may vary depending upon the presence, extent, and location of metastasis to other parts of the body. Following are the symptoms commonly seen in adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland:


    Ribbon-shaped stool
    Poor appetite
    Weight loss
    Difficulty in passing urine
    Complete urine blockage
    Pain, especially when the affected 	area of the prostate is touched
    Fever
    Difficult breathing


Causes


    Idiopathic - the exact cause is 	still unknown
    Hormonal imbalance is suggested as 	one possible cause


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination on your cat, including blood tests and a biochemistry profile. Urine tests are an important part of the diagnostic process. The urine will be examined for the presence of white blood cells, infection, and malignant cells. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasonography will also be performed to view the symmetry, size, and outline of the prostate gland. Prostate tissue will also be taken by prostatic biopsy to help confirm the diagnosis.

  

Treatment

There is no single definitive treatment in cats with adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are sometime the chosen therapy for cats and may increase the survival time. Treatment should be conducted and supervised by a veterinary oncologist. Due to the close association of the prostate gland with the urethra, removal of the prostate gland by surgery is difficult and mostly unrewarding. In addition,  postoperative complications are high and difficult to manage. An alternative solution to disorders of the prostate, castration, does not help with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as this tumor does not respond well afterward.

Living and Management

For cats that have suffered from adenocarcinoma of the prostate, many face permanent difficulties with urination and defecation. Inability to urinate and defecate properly is often accompanied by severe pain, restlessness and great discomfort. Observe your cat especially during its urination and defecation routines and inform your veterinarian if your cat is not able to pass urine or feces effectively. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines, especially in giving chemotherapeutic agents at home. Many chemotherapeutic agents can be hazardous to your health if not handled properly, consult with your veterinarian on the best handling practices. During this period you can improve your cat's quality of life by providing extra care and affection."," and Types

169,Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats,"What Is Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats?
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a genetic disorder of the retina that can, over time, lead to blindness in both eyes.

Considered rare in cats, PRA affects the retina which converts light to electrical and chemical signals. These signals are transmitted through the optical nerve to the brain to form pictures. The retina is composed of specialized photoreceptor cells called rods and cones. Rods function better in dim lighting and help detect motion and shapes, while cones work better in bright light and have a greater sensitivity to detect colors.

Types of PRA in Cats

Progressive Retinal Atrophy is a general term for several inherited disorders affecting the retina. However, the disorders can be grouped into two main types. The types differ in when PRA develops and whether the inherited gene is recessive (requiring a recessive gene from each parent) or dominant (only one gene is required).


	Photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptor cells gradually deteriorate, with symptoms developing around three to five years of age. This type is recessively inherited and plays a role in rod development.
	Photoreceptor dysplasia. This form is only seen in Abyssinian cats, occurring when photoreceptor cells do not develop properly early in a kitten’s life. Symptoms develop early, with blindness within a few months of birth. This type has a dominant mode of inheritance.


Symptoms of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Most cats will begin to experience night blindness initially, because the condition affects the rod photoreceptor cells first. Vision loss will gradually worsen over the months and years. PRA affects both eyes.

Other symptoms you may notice include:


	Disorientation and bumping into objects
	Difficulty finding food and water bowls, or toys
	Reluctance to go up or down stairs, or enter a dark room
	Reclusive at night
	Dilated pupils
	Sluggish pupillary light reflexes, as well as diminished or loss of other eye-related reflexes
	Greater reflectiveness (sheen) of the eye
	Cataracts, which often manifest as white-opaque crystalline deposits in the eyes, occur usually as a secondary complication


Causes of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
PRA is an inherited condition, meaning one or both parents have a gene that causes the condition. Abyssinians are the breed most often associated with PRA. Other breeds predisposed to PRA include:


	
	Persian
	
	
	Siamese
	
	
	Somali
	
	
	Ocicat
	
	
	Oriental shorthair
	
	
	Bengal
	
	
	Cornish Rex
	


Males and females are equally affected, and because this condition is inherited, it is most noticeable in kittens and younger cats. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Your veterinarian may initially suspect PRA during a routine eye exam, especially in kittens because there are notable changes in the appearance of the retina. Diminished or absent eye reflexes may be noted as well, but they may not always show up in the earlier stages of the disease, and a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist may be necessary. 

The ophthalmologist often will evaluate the eye with specialized lenses and may recommend a more advanced procedure called electroretinography (ERG), in which electrical signals are measured against the retina and recorded. This test can determine if the retina is functioning properly. 

Other tests such as blood work, urine testing, blood pressure analysis, testing for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and taurine blood levels may be recommended. The results from these tests not only provide a baseline but can also help exclude other conditions that also cause blindness. 

Additionally, there are genetic/DNA tests available which can identify carrier animals so breeders can make well-informed ethical breeding decisions. Affected cats should not be bred. 

Treatment of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Although no effective treatment or cure exists, it does not cause pain. No medications or supportive care, other than some environmental modifications, are required and it does not require future follow-up visits. 

Over time, your cat will become blind, and if you notice your pet bumping into objects or seems to be disoriented, reach out to your veterinarian for advice on how to manage this new development.

Recovery and Management of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats
Most cats adapt well to this condition because the loss of vision is progressive, and cats have time to adapt and learn to rely on their other senses. The key to managing this condition is ensuring a safe home environment:


	
	Minimize relocating furniture
	
	
	Block off access to the stairs, pools, etc.
	
	
	Keep the floor free from clutter
	
	
	Keep your cat indoors
	
	
	Apply padding to sharp edges and corners
	


Be sure to get your cat’s attention prior to approaching or petting her to prevent startling her.  Voice commands can be useful when navigating around the home. 

Proper diet is important, as well as including the amino acid taurine in their diet. This ingredient can be helpful in preventing retinal disease. Most commercially prepared diets have enough taurine already included. Be sure to look for diets that are AAFCO approved or ask your veterinarian for recommendations. 
Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) in Cats FAQsHow common is PRA in cats?Thankfully, PRA is an uncommon condition in cats, but purebreds are at a higher risk especially Abyssinians. Responsible breeding can play a role in reducing this disease in the cat population.
What causes PRA in cats?PRA is an inherited condition. The defect is attributed to either the CRX or CEP290 genes, which play a role in proper retina function, as the retina of the eye converts light into electrical impulses which further creates vision. 
Can PRA be cured in cats?Unfortunately, there is neither a treatment nor cure for this condition, but it does not cause the cat pain. Cats can adapt to their blindness and can continue to have a good quality of life.

170,Poxvirus Infection in Cats,"Viral Skin Infection in Cats

The poxvirus infection is caused by a DNA virus from the Poxviridae virus family, specifically from the Orthopoxvirus genus. This is a relatively common transmitted virus, but it can be readily inactivated by several types of viral disinfectants.

Cats of all ages, genders, and breeds are susceptible to the poxvirus infection, and both domestic and exotic cats can contract a poxvirus infection. It is important to note, however, that the virus is geographically limited to Eurasia, the continents of Europe, and Asia.

Symptoms and Types

Skin lesions are one of the primary symptoms of poxvirus infection in cats. These lesions may develop immediately, or they may be secondary, developing after one to three weeks. The lesions are generally circular and crusty, and multiple lesions usually develop on the head, neck, or forelimbs. In approximately 20 percent of cases, lesions appear in the mouth (oral lesions).

In some cases, additional systematic symptoms may appear, including anorexia, sluggishness, vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, and discharge from the eyes (conjunctivitis).

Causes

The poxvirus infection is caused by the Orthopoxvirus, from the family Poxviridae. This virus is found in wild rodents, and infection is thought to be acquired through bites from infected rodents. Bites typically occur when a cat is exhibiting normal hunting behavior.  Lesions will often develop at the site of the bite wound (see symptom details referring to lesions). There are also some cases of cat-to-cat transmission, although these instances are rare. Most cases of poxvirus infection occur between the months of August and October, when small wild mammals are most active, and are at maximum population.

Diagnosis

The poxvirus infection may be diagnosed by isolating the virus from scab material taken from the surface of the lesions. This is one method of definitive diagnosis, with a 90 percent chance of correctly identifying the virus if it is present. A microscopic skin biopsy can also be useful.

If the poxvirus is not present, other diagnoses may include bacterial or fungal infections, or an irregular cell growth, such as a tumor.



Treatment

There is no specific treatment available for treating the poxvirus infection in cats, but supportive treatment may be given to help treat the symptoms. This can include antibiotic therapy for the prevention of secondary infections. An Elizabethan collar (a cone shaped collar placed around the neck) may be used to prevent self-induced damage caused by excessive licking, or from scratching at face and head lesions.

Living and Management
 
Most cats that have been infected by the poxvirus will recover spontaneously within one to two months. Healing may be delayed by secondary bacterial skin infection, but this can be prevented by regular administration of antibiotics, as prescribed by your veterinarian. Symptoms should be monitored in case additional precautions need to be taken."," and Types

171,Pouch-like sacs on the Esophageal Wall in Cats,"Esophageal Diverticula in Cats

Pulsion diverticula is a pushing outward of the wall of an internal, hollow organ, in this case, the esophagus. It is caused by increased pressure from within the esophageal cavity (intraluminal). This is directly related to esophageal diverticula, which is characterized by large, pouch-like sacs on the esophageal wall. Traction diverticula occurs secondary to inflammation, where fibrosis and contraction pull the wall of the esophagus out into a pouch, resulting in obstruction or failure of the esophageal muscles to move food through to the stomach. 

Diverticula most commonly occurs at the inlet to the esophagus or near the diaphragm, with food being taken into the mouth and getting caught in a pouch as it travels down the esophagus toward the stomach. Organ systems affected include the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and respiratory. Although no genetic basis has been proven, it may be congenital (present at birth), or acquired. There is no specific breed or gender predisposition for this disease.

Symptoms and Types


    Regurgitation following eating, difficult swallowing, lack of appetite, coughing
    Weight loss, respiratory distress (aspiration pneumonia)

 
Causes


    Pulsion Diverticulum
    Embryonic developmental disorders of the esophageal wall
    Esophageal foreign body or failure of the muscles to move food through
    Traction Diverticulum
    Inflammatory process associated with the trachea, lungs, lymph nodes, or lining of the stomach; causes fibrous tissue formation around the esophagus


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct an esophagram, or an esophagoscopy to examine the diverticula in order to determine whether there is a related mass. An X-ray of the chest area, and a fluoroscopal examination to evaluate the movement of food through the esophagus will give your doctor a better idea of where the diverticula is placed in the esophageal wall. An injection of a radiocontrasting agent into the esophageal passage may be used to improve visibility on an X-ray so that an exact determination can be made, as the substance flows down the esophagus, filling the pouches as is does.

  

Treatment

If the diverticulum is small and is not causing significant clinical signs, your veterinarian may only recommend a change in diet for your cat. A soft, bland diet, given frequently and followed by copious liquids, will most likely travel through the esophagus to the stomach unhindered. If the diverticulum is large, or is associated with significant clinical signs, surgical resection will probably be recommended. The potential for food being drawn into the lungs, and leading to aspiration pneumonia makes the importance of dietary management key to avoiding fatal complications. Fluid therapy, antibiotics, and aggressive care will be called for if aspiration pneumonia is present. Nutrition given via tube will also be necessary. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications for your cat on the basis of the diagnosis.

Living and Management

Your doctor will want to monitor your cat for evidence and prevention of infection or aspiration pneumonia. You will need to maintain a positive nutritional balance throughout the disease process. Cats with diverticula and impaction (i.e., food material that is packed tightly) are predisposed to perforation, fistula, stricture, and postoperative rupturing of the incision. For this reason, your veterinarian will want to revisit your cat on a regular schedule. Prognosis is guarded in patients with large diverticula and overt clinical signs."," and Types

172,Postpartum Low Blood Calcium in Cats,"Postpartum Eclampsia in Cats

Eclampsia is a deficiency of blood calcium (hypocalcemia) that develops in the weeks after giving birth, although it may develop prior to birth or during lactation. Also called ""milk fever,"" eclampsia is usually due to an underactive parathyroid gland, the gland that is responsible for regulating the parathyroid hormone, which in turn regulates the amount of calcium that is stored in the bones, to be removed as needed for use in the blood. As the parathyroid gland has not being signaled to stimulate the parathyroid hormone to release calcium from the bones into the body, when the nursing queen's milk comes in and the demand for calcium suddenly increases, the parathyroid gland is unable to respond quickly enough for her needs to be met.  The lack of calcium results in tonoclonic contractions of the skeletal muscles, where the muscles in the body contract convulsively, limiting movement.

Kittens are often not affected by eclampsia because their nutritional needs, including calcium, are being taken care of by their mother. In addition, symptoms in the nursing queen typically become apparent in the first 40 days after giving birth.

Symptoms and Types


    Poor 	maternal behavior
    Restlessness, 	nervousness
    Disorientation
    Panting, 	whining
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Clumsy 	walking, stiff gait
    Facial 	itchiness
    Muscle 	tremors, tetany (entire body goes stiff), convulsions
    Cat 	lies down with paws rigidly extended (usually seen 8–12 hours 	after the first onset of symptoms)
    High 	body temperature, fever over 105 degrees Fahrenheit
    Rapid, 	heavy breathing
    Dilated 	pupils which are slow to contract when exposed to light


Causes


    Calcium 	supplementation during pregnancy
    Inappropriate 	calcium to phosphorous ratio in the diet while pregnant
    Poor 	nutrition during pregnancy
    First 	litter


Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Make sure to provide your veterinarian with the type of pregnancy supplement you have been giving to your cat, and details of the diet you have been feeding her.
Standard tests will include a chemical blood profile, complete blood count and an electrolyte panel. As soon as the electrolyte panel is ready, the total serum calcium will be verified by a blood test. If the concentration is less than 7 mg/dL, your cat will be diagnosed with eclampsia and will be given calcium supplementation immediately. Low blood sugar and low blood magnesium levels may also be present. These can also be supplemented. Serum potassium is high in 56 percent of cases. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showing the heart's electrical rhythm will often be abnormal.

  

Treatment

This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition, but it can be treated quickly and the cat's health stabilized if she is treated as soon as symptoms become apparent. If your cat has a high fever, your veterinarian will try to cool her down with a cool water soak and fan to bring the body temperature down to a normal range. Your veterinarian will treat your cat with intravenous calcium until her levels have increased to a safe level, and until her body alone is able to maintain calcium levels.
Your veterinarian will advise you to take the kittens away to prevent them from nursing, to be hand fed with a commercial milk for 24 hours, or  until the queen's serum calcium is stabilized. If, after the mother stabilizes, you opt to let the kittens continue nursing, you will need to return to your veterinarian to monitor calcium levels in your cat's blood. Depending on whether her body is able to begin producing sufficient amounts of calcium on its own, she may need to remain on calcium supplements for some time. Your doctor will determine this.

Living and Management

If the kittens are not hand-raised and continue to nurse, it is very likely that your cat will need to be given calcium supplements for the duration of the nursing period, until the kittens have been weaned. Her serum calcium levels will need to be monitored frequently through the nursing period. Ensuring that she eats a diet containing a 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 calcium to phosphorus ratio, before pregnancy and during pregnancy, will help to prevent eclampsia with future litters.

Calcium supplementation must also be avoided while your cat is pregnant, unless specifically prescribed by your veterinarian. Also advised is avoiding high phytate foods, such as soybean mean, barley, rice, wheat bran and wheat germ, as high phytate  foods can interfere with the body's absorption of calcium."," and Types

173,Posterior Displacement of the Bladder in Cats,"Pelvic Bladder in Cats
 
A cat's bladder may be displaced from its normal position due to anatomical irregularities, which can in the course of time affect the urethral size and/or position of the urethra, leading to concurrent infections of the urethra and/or bladder.
 
With posterior displacement of the bladder, the bladder is displaced caudally (i.e., near the tail). This condition is also referred to as caudal displacement, and as pelvic bladder, as the bladder is found in the pelvic area, rather than closer to the abdominal area.
 
When compared to dogs, this condition is rarely seen in cats. Many suspect this is because the cat has a longer urethra than a dog of similar size. In addition, it may occur in cats of both sexes, either intact or neutered.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Some cats may not exhibit any symptoms, while in others the following may be seen:
 

    Involuntary passing of urine (urinary incontinence)
    Inability to urinate more than a few dribbles at a time
    Urgency to urinate without ability to pass urine
    Urine scalding of tail and adjacent area

 
Causes
 
Displacement of bladder from its normal position may be due to a congenital defect (birth defect). It is also thought to be caused by obesity in some cats, and is generally associated with urologic abnormalities, aside from the obvious incontinence.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including background history of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your pet’s veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. If infection is suspected, your veterinarian will take the urine sample and will send it to a laboratory to culture and hopefully identify the causative organism. Urinalysis, meanwhile, may reveal urinary tract infection like presence of pus, blood, bacteria in urine.
 
Other diagnostic procedures include adbominal X-rays and contrast cystourethrography. Radiographic examination of the urethra and urinary bladder after introduction of contrast medium may reveal a short, widened, or irregularly shaped urethra. Your veterinarian may also perform an ultrasound to examine kidneys and urinary bladder for stones, masses, distention of kidneys, and other abnormalities related to urinary system.

 


Treatment
 
In case of underlying urinary infections, your cat’s veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics to treat such infections. The cat will also require surgery to reposition the displaced bladder and urethra. On occasion, antidepressants are used to calm the animal.
 
Living and Management
 
You may need to visit your pet’s veterinarian for follow-up examinations to evaluate progress of treatment and identify possible complications. In case of urinary infections, regular antibiotic medication is often required until the infection subsides. Watch your cat for untoward symptoms and call your veterinarian immediately if anything unusual arises. Your veterinarian will also brief you about the side-effects of medications commonly used in these cases."," and Types

"
174,Polycythemia in Cats,"What Is Polycythemia in Cats?
Polycythemia in cats is a rare condition that is characterized by an abnormally high number of red blood cells (RBCs). This thickens the blood, making it more difficult to flow easily through smaller veins and capillaries. Inadequate blood flow leads to poor oxygen delivery to tissues and can result in severe circulatory problems, including heart failure.

The brain and muscles require the most nutrients and oxygen. When polycythemia inhibits blood flow to these organs, cats can experience lethargy, weakness, and potentially seizures.

If left untreated, polycythemia can damage the heart. Polycythemia is a serious condition that can be fatal. If you notice symptoms of polycythemia in your cat, bring them to the veterinarian immediately.

Types of Polycythemia in Cats

Types of polycythemias in cats include:


	
	Absolute—Absolute polycythemia can be further classified as:

	
		
		Primary—Primary polycythemia, also known as polycythemia rubra vera, causes uncontrolled RBC production by the bone marrow. White blood cells (WBCs) and platelets may also be elevated. Often, an affected cat’s packed cell volume (PCV), the percentage of the blood composed of RBCs, is 65% or higher. Cats with primary polycythemia have been reported to live five years or more.
		
		
		Secondary—Erythropoietin is a hormone produced by the kidneys that signals the bone marrow to produce more RBCs. Secondary polycythemia is caused by conditions that increase erythropoietin production. Examples include heart disease, chronic respiratory problems, kidney disease, and hyperthyroidism. The prognosis for cats with secondary polycythemia depends on the underlying cause.
		
	
	
	
	Relative—Relative polycythemia refers to an increase in PCV secondary to dehydration. Because the blood contains less water, the cells compose a greater percentage of the overall volume. This rarely results in a PCV greater than 60% in cats.
	
	
	Transient—Transient (short-lived) polycythemia is caused by contraction of the spleen, resulting from excitement or stress, which releases RBCs into the bloodstream. This type of RBC elevation is not long-term.
	


Symptoms of Polycythemia in Cats 
Symptoms of polycythemia in cats can include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Red gums or skin
	
	
	Lack of coordination
	
	
	Excessive thirst and urination
	
	
	Unexplained or excessive bleeding, such as nosebleeds
	
	
	Seizures
	


Causes of Polycythemia in Cats
Polycythemia in cats is a rare condition, and no breed, age, or gender is identified as being at higher risk. One cause, polycythemia rubra vera, is a bone marrow disorder that results in RBC overproduction.

Other causes of polycythemia include:


	
	Dehydration—Dehydration is the most common cause, as it leads to an increase of RBCs in proportion to fluid in the blood. Dehydration can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, or decreased water intake.
	
	
	Stress—Stress can cause the spleen to contract, resulting in transient polycythemia.
	
	
	Conditions that inhibit blood flow—When a cat has a condition (such as obesity, chronic heart or lung disease, cancer, hormonal disease, or kidney disease) that inhibits oxygen delivery to the tissues, their body may compensate by producing additional RBCs to keep up with oxygen demand.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Polycythemia in Cats
Diagnosis of polycythemia in cats involves not only determining if your cat has an increased RBC level but also diagnosing the underlying cause. Diagnostics may include:


	
	Complete blood count (CBC)—A CBC evaluates your cat’s RBCs, WBCs, and platelets to assess the cells’ size and determine if levels are appropriate.
	
	
	Total protein—If your cat’s total protein is also elevated, dehydration is likely causing the polycythemia.
	
	
	Biochemistry—A biochemistry profile can help your veterinarian determine if your cat has an underlying condition causing the polycythemia.
	
	
	Oxygen saturation—Oxygen saturation measures the amount of oxygen in the blood. If your cat’s oxygen saturation is low, your veterinarian will perform further diagnostics to identify what could be causing the issue.
	
	
	Erythropoietin—If erythropoietin levels are elevated, your cat is likely affected by an issue, such as heart or lung disease, cancer, or a hormonal disease, which triggers excessive erythropoietin production.
	
	
	Imaging—Imaging, such as X-rays and/or ultrasound, may be needed to rule out underlying issues.
	
	
	Bone marrow biopsy—A bone marrow biopsy can provide more information to facilitate a polycythemia diagnosis.
	
	
	Heart evaluation—Because polycythemia can affect your cat’s heart, your veterinarian may recommend a cardiac workup that includes an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram.
	


Treatment of Polycythemia in Cats
Treatment of polycythemia in cats depends on the condition’s underlying cause and may include:


	
	Intravenous (IV) fluids—If dehydration is the cause of your cat’s polycythemia, IV fluids will be administered to rehydrate them.
	
	
	Oxygen therapy—Your cat may need oxygen therapy if their blood oxygen saturation is low.
	
	
	Phlebotomy—Phlebotomy involves placing an IV catheter, removing a certain volume of blood, and replacing the blood with IV fluids to dilute the blood cell concentration.
	
	
	Hydroxyurea—Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy drug that works by slowing the bone marrow’s production of RBCs. RBCs live about 120 days, so positive effects won’t be observed for a while. Potential hydroxyurea side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, and lack of appetite.
	

Recovery and Management of Polycythemia in Cats
During recovery, your cat must get plenty of rest and be kept quiet.

Your veterinarian will likely recommend rechecking your cat’s bloodwork once a week for the first month, monthly for the next three months, and every three months thereafter to check the bone marrow’s response to treatment.

Some pets can be weaned off hydroxyurea after a year or two, but others must remain on medication for life.

Prevention of Polycythemia in Cats
There are no known measures to prevent primary polycythemia in cats. However, you can reduce your cat’s risk for other forms of polycythemia by:


	
	Keeping your cat well hydrated

175,Poisoning by Petroleum Products in Cats,"Petroleum Hydrocarbon Toxicosis in Cats

When a cat is exposed to refined petroleum oil products, or ingests products of this type, it can result in a severe and disease-like physical reaction, which is referred to as petroleum hydrocarbon toxicosis.

Petroleum products that commonly poison small animals are fuels, solvents, lubricants, and waxes, as well as some pesticides and paints that have a petroleum base. Petroleum products like benzene and turpentine are more likely to be inhaled into the lungs, causing chemical pneumonitis, a life-threatening condition in which the petroleum product spreads all over the surface of the lungs, causing inflammation. Products that have an aromatic, ring-like chemical structure, such as benzene, are most likely to cause systemic toxicity (throughout the body).

Putting petroleum products like gasoline or kerosene on a cat’s skin, or near its mouth, will poison it. Some animals are exposed to these products through exposure to accidental spills, and sometimes people will put gasoline, or other solvents, on a cat to remove something that has gotten onto its skin or hair, such as paint and other sticky substances.

Do not induce vomiting with this type of poisoning, as the substance may do more harm coming back through the esophagus than it did going down. Or, your cat could breath some of the toxin into its lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia.

Dogs are also susceptible to petroleum hydrocarbon toxicosis. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Causes


    Inhalation, 	ingestion, direct contact with petroleum hydrocarbons: gasoline, 	benzenes, kerosene, paint thinner, linseed oil, and turpentine (the 	last two are not hydrocarbons, but the toxic effect on the body is 	very similar)
    Toxicity 	can result from swallowing petroleum hydrocarbons, having petroleum 	hydrocarbons on the skin, having petroleum hydrocarbons in the fur, 	or from breathing fumes from petroleum hydrocarbons




Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by the toxin, as well as to be able to rule out other toxicities, such as ethylene glycol or drug exposure. If you can take a sample of your cat’s vomit to your veterinarian, treatment can possibly be administered with more immediacy.

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will test vomit or stomach contents for petroleum distillates. Some cats develop aspiration pneumonia from inhalation of a petroleum product. Your veterinarian will take X-ray images of the chest to look for evidence of inflammation and pneumonia, so that it can be treated immediately.

Treatment

Your veterinarian will give your cat activated charcoal to decontaminate and neutralize the toxin. If your cat  ingested the petroleum products recently, a stomach lavage (wash) will also be performed. Causing the cat to vomit is usually not wise under these circumstances, as the cat may contract aspiration pneumonia, a potential and very serious side effect of vomiting.

In all cases of uncomplicated petroleum hydrocarbon ingestion (i.e., not contaminated with some other, more toxic substance), the primary goal is to minimize the risk of aspiration into the cat's lungs. Your veterinarian may give your cat oxygen therapy, depending on the health of its lungs when it arrives at the veterinary hospital. If your cat had petroleum hydrocarbons on its skin or fur, it will be bathed at the hospital, and possibly given topical antibiotics to prevent infection of the skin due to irritation.

Living and Management

Keep all petroleum products and petroleum-based products out of your cat's reach, preferably in a locked or childproof cabinet, to prevent accidental poisoning. If your cat shows any signs of respiratory distress at home after it is released from the hospital, such as an increased breathing rate, panting, coughing, etc., call your veterinarian immediately and take your cat to a veterinary hospital for emergency treatment."," and Types

176,Poisoning by Hypercalcemic Agents and Their Treatments in Cats,"Hypercalcemic Agent Poisoning in Cats

Of the various types of substances that are poisonous to animals, there are those that include hypercalcemic agents. Hypercalcemic agents contain vitamin D, medically known as cholecalciferol, which works by raising the calcium content in blood serum to high toxic levels, resulting in cardiac arrhythmias, and eventually, death. The condition of hypercalcemia is defined as an abnormally elevated level of calcium in the blood.

Hypercalcemic agents are popular for use in rodent poisons, since rodents do not have resistance to cholecalciferol. In most cases, poisons containing cholecalciferol must be directly consumed by an animal for it to fall ill. The exception to this is when a poisoned rodent is ingested by another animal.

Cats that have consumed hypercalcemic poisons typically will not show immediate symptoms. Symptoms of poisoning may show 18 to 36 hours after the cholecalciferol containing poison was consumed. Left untreated, a cat can die from cholecalciferol poisoning and the resulting hypercalcemia. For the cat that does survive, it will continue to have elevated calcium levels for weeks after the poisoning, and this excess of calcium can lead to secondary health problems, such as renal (kidney) failure.

Symptoms


	Increased thirst
	Frequent urination
	Vomiting
	Generalized weakness
	Muscle spasms
	Seizures
	Fatigue
	Elevated blood serum calcium


Causes


	Ingestion of rodent poisons, or, ingestion of the rodent that ingested the poison
	Any poison that contains hypercalcemic agents


The main cause of hypercalcemic poisoning is from the ingestion of rodent poison. If you suspect that your cat has come into contact with rat or mouse poison, and you are seeing some of the symptoms listed above, you will need to have your cat seen by a doctor before its health becomes critical. Keep in mind that if your cat goes out of doors at all there is the possibility that it will come into contact with rodent poisons. The poison might be in a neighbor's yard, in a trash bag, in an alleyway, or the poison might have been ingested by a rat or mouse that your cat has caught and ingested parts from. Even if you do not live in an area where rats or mice are a concern, rodent poison may be used for other common suburban pests, like raccoons, opossums, or squirrels.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account your cat's background medical history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, and a complete blood count. Your veterinarian will conduct a blood test to check your cat's calcium levels and to confirm the presence of poison. If possible, you should take a sample of your cat's vomit with you to the veterinarian, so that it can also be examined for the presence of poison. If you actually have the poison that your cat ingested, you should take that to your doctor as well.

Treatment

One of the side effects of hypercalcemic poisoning is dehydration, which can lead to organ failure and seizures. You will need to make sure that your cat is getting plenty of water, and that it is actually able to retain the water it is taking in (i.e., not vomiting it back up). Adding a small amount of salt to the water you are giving to your cat will encourage fluid retention, since increased salt can both help to increase or maintain body fluid, and induce normal excretion by the kidney. Your veterinarian will work on correcting your cat's body fluids, electrolyte imbalances, and calcium levels using diuretics, prednisone, and oral phosphorus binders, along with a low calcium diet.

Living and Management

Animals that have survived poisoning due to hypercalcemic agents may continue to experience long term side effects due to the high level of calcium in the blood, and in the body's organs. The kidneys are commonly damaged as a result of hypercalcemia.

Prevention

The best prevention is to keep rodent poisons placed in areas that are not accessible to your cat, and to supervise your cat so that it does not get hold of a rodent that may have ingested poison containing a hypercalcemic agent. If you observe your cat with a rodent, try to get the rodent away from your cat before it is able to ingest a substantial amount of it."," of poisoning may show 18 to 36 hours after the cholecalciferol containing poison was consumed. Left untreated, a cat can die from cholecalciferol poisoning and the resulting hypercalcemia.

177,Pneumonia (Interstitial) in Cats,"Interstitial Pneumonia in Cats

Pneumonia refers to an inflammation in the cat's  lungs. Interstitial pneumonia, meanwhile, refers to a form of pneumonia in which the inflammation occurs in the walls of the cat's alveoli (the air cells of the lungs), or in the interstitium (the spaces between the tissue cells of the alveoli). The alveoli are cellular components of the cat's airway -- where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged.

Interstitial pneumonia can occur in both cats and dogs, with some breeds being more susceptible than others. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the disease. Some symptoms that may appear in the cat include tachypnea, coughing, dyspnea, mild fever, and discharge from the eyes. Exposure to toxic elements, for example, may also result in gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and a decreased amount of urine production.

Causes

There is a wide range of conditions that can lead to interstitial pneumonia in cats. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, a congenital (birth) defect, is characterized by inflamed airways and surrounding tissues, and increased odds of interstitial pneumonia.

Other causes include lung cancer, and metabolic disorders such as uremia, in which excess levels of urea and other nitrogenous waste products, which normally are excreted through the urine, appear in the cat's blood.

Infectious diseases such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and exposure to toxic elements through inhalation of dust, gas, or vapor, are also suspect in the diagnosis of causative factors.

Diagnosis

There are a wide variety of diagnostic procedures that can be used if symptoms related to interstitial pneumonia appear, including a urine analysis, blood tests, X-ray imaging of the pleural cavity (the area between the chest wall and lungs), and an electrocardiography (ECG) test, used for measuring the electrical impulses of the heart, and for the detection of irregular heart rhythms related to increased pressure on the lungs.

Two more diagnostic procedures that are common when pneumonia is suspected are a tracheal wash, which involves a collection of the fluids and substances lining the trachea, and a bronchoscopy, by which a small tube with a tiny camera attached is inserted into the mouth and led into the bronchial airway so that a visual inspection can be made.



Treatment

Cats with severe symptoms should be actively treated in hospital. This is especially important if your cat is exhibiting respiratory distress, in which case an oxygen mask will be used for administering oxygen therapy. Antimicrobial medication to prevent secondary bacterial infection is often prescribed.

Additional medication is dependent upon the underlying cause for the interstitial pneumonia; your veterinarian will advise you on the appropriate medications and home treatment.

Living and Management

Following initial treatment, activity should be restricted, and exposure to any harmful substances, such as dust, vapor, chemical fumes, or tobacco smoke, should be avoided. Administer medications on a regular basis and in full, as prescribed by your veterinarian, and schedule regular follow-up visits.

Prevention

While there are many causes of interstitial pneumonia, there are a few things cat owners can do to help prevent the development of this disease.


    Properly vaccinate your cat.
    Bring it to your veterinarian for regular deworming.
    Place inhalation hazards, such as materials that give off toxic fumes, in a safe and secure area that is out your pet's reach."," and Types

178,Pneumonia in Cats,"What Is Pneumonia in Cats?
Lungs play a vital role in the health of all creatures. The lungs of a cat function like those of other mammals by removing used air (carbon dioxide) and supplying the body with fresh oxygen. 

Lungs don’t just move air in and out of the body; they also transfer oxygen directly to the bloodstream. Pneumonia occurs when this transfer of oxygen is disrupted.

In a cat with pneumonia, this oxygen disruption occurs because of inflammation and infectious material in the lungs. This causes a physical barrier between the air in the lungs and the bloodstream where the oxygen needs to go. 

If your cat is showing any symptoms of pneumonia, it is important to take them to the veterinarian immediately.

Types of Pneumonia in Cats 

There are four types of pneumonia in cats:


	
	Aspiration pneumonia: This occurs when a cat breathes in a substance that inhibits the transfer of oxygen.
	
	
	Infectious pneumonia: This results from a bacterial and/or viral infection.
	
	
	Fungal pneumonia: This is also called mycotic pneumonia, and is uncommon in cats.
	
	
	Parasitic pneumonia: This is also very uncommon in cats; however, kittens and feral and outdoor cats are known to be prone to this type of pneumonia.

Is Pneumonia Contagious to Other Cats?

Certain infectious (viral or bacterial) types of pneumonia can be contagious to other cats, and even dogs, but this is rare.

If your veterinarian suspects a contagious cause of your cat’s pneumonia, it is recommended to separate your sick cat from other pets in your household.

Certain infectious organisms can live on your sick pet’s food, water bowl, litter box, and toys. These items should not be shared between healthy and ill pets and should be washed often. Also, wash your hands after you tend to your sick kitty to prevent the spread of germs.

Causes of Pneumonia in Cats
There are several causes of pneumonia in cats, depending on the type of infection.

Aspiration pneumonia is caused by:


	
	Inhalation of vomit/stomach contents, medications, liquids, or other foreign material
	
	
	 Weak or inhibited gag reflex or weak esophageal muscles, which may result from megaesophagus, seizures, or recent anesthesia
	


Infectious pneumonia is caused by:


	
	Bacterial infections, which occur most commonly from complications of viral infections or aspiration in cats; pathogens may include Chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma, E. coli, and Staphylococcus
	
	
	Viral infections, which may include feline calicivirus, feline viral rhinotracheitis, and feline herpesvirus
	
	
	Co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus, which has been shown to make cats prone to other infectious pneumonia types
	


Fungal pneumonia:


	Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection in cats and these fungal spores are breathed in, most often from contaminated soil


Parasitic pneumonia is caused by:


	Two species of lung worms: Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior. These affect kittens and outdoor and feral cats exposed to the worm larvae in infected water or prey species


How Veterinarians Diagnose Pneumonia in Cats
Your veterinarian may suspect your cat has pneumonia after discussing their history and symptoms with you. During your cat’s physical exam, your vet may do the following:


	
	Listen to the lungs for any labored breathing
	
	
	Order chest x-rays to inspect the lungs
	
	
	Order a blood test to check red and white blood cell levels, glucose level, and electrolyte and organ function. Elevated levels of white blood cells usually indicate an infection.
	
	
	Order an upper respiratory panel to test for viruses and bacteria that commonly cause pneumonia
	
	
	Take a fluid culture from your cat’s trachea or nasal passage to test for type of bacteria and how best to treat it
	


Treatment of Pneumonia in Cats
Treatment for pneumonia depends greatly on its type and the severity of symptoms.

Certain viral pneumonia may be treated on an outpatient basis with supportive care if your cat is otherwise doing well.

Aspiration pneumonia and infectious pneumonia are generally treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

If your cat shows moderate to severe symptoms, they may need to be hospitalized.

Additional treatments may include supportive care such as intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, nebulization to keep airways moist, supplemental oxygen, and nutrition therapy through a feeding tube.

If other infectious agents are present, antifungals or other medications may be needed.

Recovery and Management of Pneumonia in Cats
Many cats with aspiration and bacterial pneumonia require 1-3 days of hospitalization, as they might require supplemental oxygen.

Antibiotics may be prescribed to your cat for a minimum of 14 days. Viral infections may clear up on their own in 1-2 weeks but may lead to secondary bacterial infections, so close monitoring at home is important.

Most cats do not have any lingering lung problems once they have fully recovered. Certain cats with underlying disease may be susceptible to a recurrence of pneumonia.

179,Pneumonia (Fungal) in Cats,"Fungal Pneumonia in Cats

When your cat's lungs become inflammed due to a deep fungal infection, known as mycotic infection, it may have fungal pneumonia. The inflammation in this form of pneumonia may occur in the interstitial tissues (the spaces between the tissue cells); in the lymphatic vessels (the vessels within the body that transport white-blood-cell-rich lymph liquid); or in the peribronchial tissues of the lung (the tissues surrounding the bronchi -- the airways going from the windpipe to the lungs).

Both dogs and cats may develop fungal pneumonia, although this type of pneumonia occurs less commonly in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of fungal pneumonia may include a history of anorexia and corresponding weight loss, fever, discharge from the nose or eyes, coughing, difficulty breathing, lameness, and eye problems, possibly as severe as sudden blindness. A physical exam may also reveal depression, emaciation, and a crackling sound in the cat's lungs while breathing.

Causes

There are a number of fungi that can cause mycotic (deep fungal) infections; some of these include Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Aspergillus. Fungal pneumonia is geographically varying, as the different fungi responsible for mycotic infection are found in various areas of the United States. Blastomycosis, from the Blastomyces organism, for example, is found in the Southeast and Midwest, while Aspergillosis, from the Aspergillus organism, is widespread throughout the United States.

Contact with one of the fungi capable of causing mycotic infection may lead to fungal pneumonia. The exact method of contraction varies depending on the specific type of fungus. Blastomyces dermatitidis, for example, primarily enters the body by inhalation into the cat's lungs, while the Cryptococcus neoformans fungal organism generally enters the body through the nasal cavity and then migrates into the eyes and/or central nervous system from this point of entry.

Environmental exposure to any of the fungi responsible for causing fungal pneumonia may lead to the development of this disease. Thus, exposure to soils rich in organic matter, bird droppings, or fecal matter may increase the odds of contracting it.

Diagnosis

The only way to definitively diagnose fungal pneumonia is to identify the potential organism through the analysis of a skin nodule sample, or biopsy of a lymph node. Further diagnostic procedures may include urine analysis, thoracic X-rays of the chest and lungs, and abdominal ultrasounds.

If fungal pneumonia is not the cause of the cat’s symptoms, other forms of pneumonia, such as parasitic or bacterial-induced pneumonia, may be to blame. Other alternate diagnoses include chronic bronchial disease or pulmonary edema.



Treatment

If your cat is still eating, your veterinarian will prescribe medication to be given at home. If it has developed severe symptoms, such as drastic weight loss due to anorexia and dehydration, hospitalization may be necessary to stabilize your cat so that further treatment can be given. Administration of fluids, potassium, oxygen, and antibiotics should be given as necessary.

Note that less than 70 percent of dogs, and an even smaller percentage of cats are likely to respond to treatment for fungal pneumonia. Treatment is expensive and generally required for a minimum of two months -- the exact treatment and length of treatment, however, is dependent on the particular type of fungus that is responsible for the illness.

Living and Management

To avoid dehydration, the cat should be given plenty of fluids and its activities should be restricted. A high-protein diet of calorically dense food is recommended, and all medications will need to be given on a regular basis for the entire amount of time prescribed by your veterinarian. Checkups should be performed regularly, specifically, thoracic X-ray imaging, before the treatment program is completed.

Prevention

To avoid fungal pneumonia, it is advised you clean your cat’s living environment of feces or other toxic organic matter."," and Types

"
180,Pneumonia (Bacterial) in Cats,"While pneumonia refers to an inflammation of the cat's lungs, bacterial pneumonia refers specifically to an inflammation of the lungs in response to a disease-causing bacteria. This inflammation is characterized by an accumulation of cells and fluid in the lungs, airways, and alveoli (the portion of the airways in which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged).



Prognosis for bacterial pneumonia is generally good if properly treated. However, there are two secondary effects (hypoxemia and sepsis) that may result from bacterial pneumonia, and which are associated with increased fatalities. Hypoxemia refers to severely low levels of oxygen in the blood, while sepsis refers to the presence of pus-forming bacteria and their poisons in the cat's blood stream.



Bacterial pneumonia may occur in both dogs and cats, although this condition is more common in dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include cough, fever, difficulty breathing, lack of appetite and consequent weight loss, sluggishness, nasal discharge, dehydration, and rapid breathing. Intolerance to exercise due to breathing difficulties may also be apparent. Listening to the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal abnormal breathing sounds, a diagnostic process known as auscultation. Symptoms may include short rough snapping sounds known as crackles and whistling sounds known as wheezes.



Causes



Causes of bacterial infection in a cat's lungs may vary -- no single bacterium is responsible for this condition. In cats, the bacterial organisms Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella, and Moraxella are most frequently reported in cases of bacterial pneumonia. Although, cats seem less likely to contract bacterial pneumonia than dogs.



Some risk factors that may increase the risk of bacterial pneumonia include a pre-existing viral infection, difficulty swallowing, metabolic disorders, and regurgitation.



Diagnosis



Bacterial pneumonia is just one cause of pulmonary dysfunction. Additional causes may include aspiration pneumonia, in which the lungs become inflamed due to inhalation of material, such as a foreign body, or vomit. The symptoms of bacterial and aspiration pneumonia may be similar, and diagnosis must properly determine between them in cases of pulmonary dysfunction.



If bacterial pneumonia is suspected, there are a number of diagnostic procedures that may be done on the cat. A tracheal wash may be performed to gather material (fluids and cells) lining the trachea for analysis. Because the bacteria cannot always be seen via microscope, any specimens taken should be cultured for further examination. Other tests may include visual imaging, specifically X-rays of the cat's chest and lungs. Blood analysis, and urine analysis tests will also be conducted.







Treatment



Medication is necessary in cases of bacterial pneumonia; the proper antimicrobial can be selected based on results of bacterial cultures taken from a tracheal wash, for example. Additional treatment depends on the severity of signs. If multiple symptoms occur, such as anorexia, high fever, and weight loss, your cat will be actively treated in a hospital to start.



If respiratory distress is apparent, oxygen therapy may be necessary. To avoid dehydration, the veterinarian may recommend administering electrolytes by intravenous (IV) fluid therapy.



Restrict your cat's activities throughout treatment, except as part of physiotherapy, or to help improve clearing of the lungs and airways. Along with rest, be attentive to your cat's needs, and prevent it from lying in one position for long periods of time.



Living and Management



After initial treatment, your cat should be fed a diet high in protein and energy density. Your veterinarian will monitor your cat's progress with blood tests, and if needed, x-rays of the chest and lung cavity. Any prescribed antimicrobial medications should be administered regularly, as prescribed by your veterinarian.



Prevention



One way in which bacterial pneumonia can be prevented is by ensuring that your cat receives its regular vaccinations.

181,Pleural Effusion in Cats (Fluid Around the Lungs),"What Is Pleural Effusion in Cats?
For cats to breathe easily, their lungs need to be able to fill with air and expand. A buildup of fluid between the lungs and the chest wall can stop this from happening. This condition is called pleural effusion, and it can be life-threatening if not dealt with quickly.

The pleura are thin membranes that cover the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest cavity. Normally a tiny amount of fluid is present to help keep the pleura healthy and act as a lubricant when the lungs inflate and deflate.

Many health problems can lead to more fluid collecting between the pleural membranes. Small amounts of pleural effusion may not have much of an effect, but a lot of extra fluid will significantly reduce a cat’s lung capacity.

Pleural effusion is different from pulmonary edema. Both conditions can make it hard for cats to breathe, but pleural effusion is fluid around the lungs while pulmonary edema is the buildup of fluid within lung tissue. The causes and treatments for pleural effusion and pulmonary edema are also different.

Symptoms of Pleural Effusion in Cats
Cats with pleural effusion typically have a combination of the following symptoms:


	
	Rapid breathing
	
	
	Shallow breathing
	
	
	Working harder than normal to breathe
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Depending on how long the effusion has been present, how severe it is, and its underlying cause, you may also notice:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Blue-tinged or pale mucous membranes (around the eyes, nose, and mouth)
	
	
	An enlarged abdomen
	
	
	Signs of discomfort or pain
	
	
	Weakness
	


Take your cat to a veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately if they are having trouble breathing or the symptoms seemed to come on suddenly. Your cat’s life may be in danger if you wait too long.

On the other hand, mild symptoms that come on slowly (over the course of days or weeks rather than hours) are rarely an emergency. Call your regular veterinarian for advice if your cat doesn’t seem to be in distress, particularly if you already know the cause of your cat’s pleural effusion. You can also chat with a veterinary expert through Chewy’s Connect With a Vet service for insight on next steps.

Causes of Pleural Effusion in Cats
A study published in 2018 revealed the most common causes of pleural effusion in cats. Combined, these six conditions made up almost 95% of the cases of pleural effusion.


	
	Congestive heart failure (40.8%): Advanced hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other diseases that affect heart muscle often lead to congestive heart failure. This is the most common cause of pleural effusion in cats.
	
	
	Cancer (25.8%): Lymphoma, carcinoma, and other types of cancer within the chest cavity can lead to pleural effusion.
	
	
	Pyothorax (14.5%): Infections may result in a buildup of pus inside the chest cavity, which is called a pyothorax.
	
	
	Idiopathic chylothorax (6.3%): Chyle is a milky liquid that is formed in the intestines. It transports fats and other substances around the body. Cats will be diagnosed with idiopathic chylothorax when, for no apparent reason, chyle leaks out of a duct that normally drains into a large blood vessel in the chest.
	
	
	Trauma (4.2%): Being hit by a car, falling off a balcony, being attacked by a dog, or other traumatic injuries can lead to bleeding within the chest cavity or a rupture of the duct that carries chyle.
	
	
	Feline infectious peritonitis (3.2%): Young cats that have a protein-rich fluid within their chest or abdominal cavities are often diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).
	


Most of these conditions are very serious. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are important for improving a cat’s prognosis and quality of life.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Pleural Effusion in Cats
Cats that are having trouble breathing may need emergency care to stabilize their condition before a veterinarian can start looking for an underlying cause. The doctor may give your cat oxygen or do a chest tap to remove pleural effusion, which will allow their lungs to better fill with air.

When it’s safe to do so, the veterinarian will perform a physical examination and ask you about your cat’s health history, including any symptoms you’ve seen at home, when they started, and how they’ve progressed. They will also want to know if your cat goes outside or could have been injured indoors.

Diagnostic testing is usually needed to figure out exactly what is causing a cat’s pleural effusion. This may include:


	
	Examining a sample of the pleural effusion
	
	
	Chest X-rays
	
	
	Ultrasound of the heart, lungs, and chest cavity
	
	
	Advanced imaging like a CT scan or MRI
	
	
	A blood chemistry panel, complete blood cell count, and other lab work
	


 Treatment of Pleural Effusion in Cats
Often, a chest tap is the first line of treatment if a pleural effusion is greatly affecting a cat’s ability to breathe. Chest taps do not merely help diagnose the underlying cause; they can also give immediate symptomatic relief. These chest taps can be repeated if fluid returns, or the veterinarian may place a chest tube in your cat to allow for more continuous drainage.

Recovery and Management of Pleural Effusion in Cats
Additional treatments will focus on treating or managing the cat’s underlying health problem.


	
	Congestive heart failure in cats can usually be managed with medications that improve heart function and symptoms.
	
	
	Cancer is often treated with chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or palliative care. The right combination of treatments depends on the specifics of a cat’s case.
	
	
	Pyothorax that is caused by a bacterial infection will usually respond to antibiotic therapy combined with drainage of the fluid.
	
	
	Idiopathic chylothorax treatment can include feeding a low-fat diet and medications that decrease the flow of chyle. Surgery may also be necessary to tie off the duct that carries chyle into the chest cavity.
	
	
	Traumatic injuries may heal on their own with rest, pain relief, and other types of symptomatic and supportive care, but surgery is needed in some cases.
	
	
	FIP is usually fatal, but symptomatic and supportive care may improve a cat’s quality of life. New treatments are being developed and may be available in specific cases. Talk to your veterinarian about options.

182,Plague in Cats,"What Is Plague in Cats?
Plague is a rare but potentially fatal bacterial disease that affects humans and other mammals including cats. It is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis which is primarily transmitted by the fleas of rodents. 

Nicknamed “Black Death,” this disease killed millions of people in the Middle Ages, so it was classified as a pestilence or plague. Today, modern antibiotics used to treat plague are lifesaving. 

A few plague cases occur every year in the United States and throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America.  According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there has been an average of six human plague cases a year in the U.S. with the majority in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and California. 

Symptoms of Plague in Cats 
In mammals, plague is transmitted through flea bites (bubonic), contact with contaminated fluid or tissue (septicemic), or infectious droplets (pneumonic). 

Cats are most commonly affected by bubonic plague. The bacterium enters the body through the cat’s mouth after ingesting an infected animal, or through the skin from a flea bite that travels to the lymph nodes. Onset of symptoms is one to four days after exposure and includes:


	
	Fever (up to 106 F)
	
	
	Decreased appetite (anorexia)
	
	
	Lethargy          
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes, especially under the jaw
	


Septicemic plague occurs when the bacterium continues to spread through the bloodstream and affects organs including the spleen, liver, and heart. In this case, lymph nodes will not be enlarged, but the cat will likely still have the other signs of bubonic plague. Additional symptoms may include: 


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Elevated heart rate
	
	
	Trouble breathing
	
	
	Shock
	


Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. Cats with pneumonic plague have all the clinical signs of septicemic plague in addition to:


	
	Cough
	
	
	Abnormal lung sounds, such as crackles and wheezes
	


Causes of Plague in Cats 
Rodents are hosts of the bacterium Yersinia pestis usually transmitted via flea bites. The most affected rodents are prairie dogs, mice, woodrats, squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits. All mammals, however, are susceptible to plague including humans (zoonosis disease). 

Cats are infected with plague primarily by getting bitten by an infected flea or eating an infected rodent.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Plague in Cats 
Your veterinarian collects a detailed history including any travel, flea exposure, and outdoor activities such as hunting to determine if your cat has been exposed to plague.

He or she will then examine your cat for any fever, enlarged lymph nodes, or breathing difficulty. The vet may also recommend a complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis for a baseline evaluation. Plague is rare in cats, and your vet can confirm the diagnosis by ruling out more common illnesses such as other bacterial or viral infections.   

Often, Yersinia pestis can be visually identified by examining samples of blood under a microscope, as well as samples of blood, saliva, or fluid from your cat’s lymph nodes. Cultures and specialized lab testing may also be submitted to help with the diagnosis.

Treatment of Plague in Cats 
Without rapid treatment, plague in cats can be fatal. Treatment typically includes antibiotics and hospitalization for supportive care such as IV fluids and treatment of any vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Oxygen therapy may be needed for cats that have trouble breathing. 

Plague is a reportable disease, which means that doctors and veterinarians are required to report it to a public health authority for contact tracing and infection tracking.  
Recovery and Management of Plague in Cats 
Early and aggressive treatment is key to successful plague management. Cats remain infectious for up to 72 hours after starting antibiotic treatment and should stay hospitalized during that time.

Antibiotics are usually prescribed for 10-21 days, and your cat should improve within the first few days of treatment. Most cats that respond favorably to initial treatment make a complete recovery and go on to live normal lives. 

Prevention of Plague in Cats

Transmission from flea bites is a common source of plague in cats, so regular flea and tick prevention treatment is highly recommended.

If you live in an area where there are known cases of plague, it may be wise to keep your cat indoors to minimize exposure and risk. It is also a good idea to reduce the rodent habitat around your home by removing brush, rock piles, and outdoor clutter. 

Additional public health education, resources, and general information regarding plague, can be found on the CDC website.

There is currently no vaccination available for humans or pets against plague in the U.S., so prevention is the best defense.

183,Pink Growths in the Nose and Pharynx in Cats,"Nasal and Nasopharyngeal Polyps in cats

Nasal polyps refer to protruding pink polypoid growths that are benign (not cancerous), and that are found to arise from the mucous membranes - the moist tissues lining the nose. Nasopharyngeal polyps refer to similar benign growths, but in this case may be found extending into the ear canal, pharynx (throat), and nasal cavity. Kittens and young adult cats between the ages of four months to approximately seven years are especially susceptible to the development of nasopharyngeal polyps.

The symptoms caused by nasal polyps can mimic illness, but do not respond to antibiotic therapy.

Symptoms and Types

Nasal polyps

    Nasal congestion
    Nasal discharge that is unresponsive to antibiotics
    Sneezing
    Decreased nasal airflow
    Noisy breathing, especially when inhaling


Nasopharyngeal Polyps

    Many of the same symptoms as nasal 	polyps
    Trouble with swallowing (dysphagia)
    Trouble breathing in (dyspnea)
    Frequently tilting head to the side
    Ear infection, inflammation of the ear canal (otitis)
    Symptoms of Horner's Syndrome: drooping of eyelid, sunken eye, protruding third eyelid, abnormally small pupil


Causes

The causes of nasal polyps are unknown. It is suspected that congenital processes may be to blame (in which the tendency to develop this type of condition is passed on to offspring while in utero), or alternately, that these may develop secondary to chronic inflammatory processes.

Diagnosis

If nasal or nasopharyngeal polyps are suspected, in many cases the cat will need to be anesthetized so that a veterinarian can examine the palate (the roof of the mouth cavity) in search of evidence of polyps. Another diagnostic procedure is a caudal rhinoscopy, in which a spay hook and dental mirror, or flexible endoscope (a thin rod with a small camera attached), is inserted into the nose for examination. A rostral rhinoscopy also allows for visualization, while also making it possible for your doctor to take tissue samples so that a biopsy analysis may be taken of any apparent masses. This is in order to differentiate the mass as benign or malignant (cancerous).

Additional diagnostic tests may include X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI) scans in order to detect lesions of the nasal cavity, or nasopharnyx. These imaging techniques are especially useful in pinpointing other causes for the cat's symptoms.

If nasal polyps or nasopharyngeal polyps are not found to be responsible for the cat's symptoms, alternate diagnoses may include an obstruction in the upper airway, a neurologic disease, or a foreign body in the airway.



Treatment

The primary method of treatment for nasal or nasopharnygeal polyps is surgery. It is important that both the root and base, or stalk, of the polyp are completely removed in order to prevent recurrence. After surgery, medications will be prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial or yeast infection of the affected areas. Your veterinarian can recommend the appropriate drugs based on a culture from the removed mass and sensitivity testing.

Living and Management

After the initial treatment, your cat's symptoms should be closely monitored for recurrence of the polyps. It is not uncommon for recurrence due to incomplete removal of a polyp or the stalk it grew from. However, if removal was complete, the prognosis for all patients is generally excellent.

Prevention

Because the cause of nasal polyps and nasopharyngeal polyps are not known, there is no specific prevention technique that can be recommended."," and Types

184,Pillow Foot (Pododermatitis) in Cats,"What Is Pillow Foot in Cats?
Feline plasma cell pododermatitis (PCP), also known as cat pillow foot, is a skin disease afflicting the paw pads in cats. The flesh of the paw pads is invaded by plasma cells, causing the pads to swell, resembling a pillow.

Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell activated in response to an infection or an inflammatory process. This infection or inflammation causes activation of the immune system’s plasma cells, then secretions against the infection or inflammatory process. The secretions build up in the paw pad, creating ballooning or swelling.

With PCP, the paw pads:


	Are swollen or puffy, and smooth
	
	
	Are affected on multiple feet
	
	
	Initially have no ulcerations, but deep fissure lines (deep linear cracks) are present
	
	
	Are deep pink or purple in color with multiple white striations 
	
	
	May indent in response to pressure, then become puffy when pressure is removed
	
	
	Eventually may break open, resulting in limping or lameness
	
In some rare cases, the following symptoms can also be seen due to the increased numbers of plasma cells being generated in the body:


	Swelling at the bridge of the nose
	
	
	Upper respiratory tract infection 
	
	
	Inflammation of gum tissue and the lining of the mouth (stomatitis) 
	
	
	Glomerulonephritis (inflammation and dysfunction of the capillaries in the kidneys)
	
	
	Eosinophilic granuloma (a mass or nodular lesion containing white blood cells called eosinophils, usually found on the back of the thighs, on the face, or in the mouth)
	
What Does Pillow Foot in Cats Look Like?
Photo of pododermatitis or pillow foot in cats - Image Credit: Dr. Heather ZarrellaPhoto of pododermatitis or pillow foot in cats - Image Credit: Dr. Heather ZarrellaCauses of Cat Pillow Foot
The exact cause of pillow foot is unknown. It behaves like an autoimmune condition, so food allergies or environmental allergies could be a trigger. Contributing factors to the development of PCP are viral infections like feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

Most cats with PCP are domestic short-haired cats, but PCP has been reported in non-short-haired breeds. Male cats are more frequently affected than female cats. Outdoor cats may be more likely to be affected than indoor cats due to their increased exposure to environmental factors.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Pillow Foot
Based on the signs and symptoms listed above and a thorough history, PCP might be a working diagnosis (meaning the most likely cause of the symptoms, without a definite test to confirm). If other possibilities seem less likely, treatment may be started.

However, for a definite diagnosis, a biopsy of the paw pad lesions, while swollen, is needed. A biopsy determines if the lesions are from PCP, an eosinophilic granuloma, or a neoplasia, and if there is a bacterial and fungal component that will also require treatment. Cats with plasma cell pododermatitis may have elevated numbers of circulating plasma cells and high globulin levels. These changes support a diagnosis of PCP, but alone are not enough for a diagnosis.
Treatment of Cat Pillow Foot
Treatment is aimed at reducing swelling, pain, and discomfort and addressing any secondary bacterial or fungal infections.

Since plasma cells are activated from the immune system, focusing on the immune system to control symptoms is the first step in therapy. Initially, this may include anti-inflammatory oral glucocorticoids (like prednisolone), long-acting glucocorticoid injections (like methyl prednisolone), the antibiotic doxycycline, and the immunosuppressive cyclosporine. Improvement should be seen within one to two months with oral medications.

In extreme cases, surgery to remove the affected areas of the paw pads may be needed if they are severely ulcerated.
Recovery and Management of Cat Pillow Foot
The effects of PCP can be cleared, but reoccurrences can happen. Once a pet has developed PCP, it is possible to develop it again. Some cats may require medication for life to keep symptoms controlled.

In cases where surgical excision was performed, recovery time can be between two and four weeks. Recovery time is based on many factors: how immobile a cat is during the healing process (decreasing trauma to the surgical site), how extensive the damage from PCP was, and the ability to keep the paw pads clean.

When left untreated, the higher levels of plasma cells and globulins (a type of protein) in the can be fatal. 
Cat Pillow Foot FAQsCan pillow foot in cats be cured?Pillow foot can be well controlled, but not cured entirely. It is possible that symptoms may reoccur. Most cats can achieve remission, with their paw pads returning to normal with appropriate therapy. However, some cats may require medication for life to keep PCP controlled.
Is pododermatitis in cats serious?Yes, pillow foot can be serious. While not usually fatal, when left untreated, pillow foot affects other organs, especially the kidneys.
Is pillow foot painful for cats?Because cats may limp on the affected foot and lick the affected paw, pillow foot may not always cause discomfort and pain from the paw’s swelling. However, secondary infections can cause pain.

185,Pica in Cats,"What Is Pica in Cats?
Pica is defined as the consistent chewing, sucking, or consumption of inappropriate and inedible materials, most commonly seen with cardboard, fabric, paper, plants, plastic, rubber, soil, and wood.

Pica is not very common, but because the material ingested is inedible, it will cause stomach upset and can also become lodged in the gastrointestinal tract causing multiple conditions, including being life-threatening if left untreated. Surgery is often required.

The science of this disorder is not well understood, but the behavior eventually becomes obsessive due to increased reward sensations from the behavior itself, which promotes more of the behavior.

Pica isn’t always the sign of an underlying health issue, but the results can be devastating—including health risks to the cat, damage to the pet parent’s belongings, and erosion of the human-animal bond.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Pica in Cats
The hallmark symptom noted with pica is the actual behavior itself—chewing, sucking, or ingesting non-edible materials. Cats can also exhibit other symptoms associated with pica or its results, such as:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Lack of appetite or thirst
	
	
	Constipation, straining to defecate
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Causes of Pica in Cats
Pica can be challenging to pinpoint to a single cause, although several have been implicated, such as:


	
	Behavioral conditions that arise from anxiety, stress, boredom, or compulsion: The behavior may have started innocently, but has become obsessive over time.
	
	
	Early weaning or lack of socialization: Pica is seen more often in younger cats.
	
	
	Endocrine diseases: such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, anemia (low red blood cell counts), and liver disease.
	
	
	Genetics: Some breeds, such as Siamese and Burmese, have higher incidences of pica than others, although any cat can be affected.
	
	
	Gastrointestinal disease
	
	
	Neurologic disease
	
	
	Parasites and other infections, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)
	
	
	Poor diet or malnutrition
	
	
	Pyruvate kinase deficiency: Lack of an enzyme needed for red blood cells results in anemia.
	
	
	Teething-related difficulties
	


 How Veterinarians Diagnose Pica in Cats
If your cat is displaying signs of pica, seek veterinary attention to help rule out underlying medical conditions. Screening tests such as baseline bloodwork, urine testing, and stool examinations will most likely be performed, in addition to a detailed history and physical exam.

There is no diagnostic test specifically for pica, so often a combination of the above and other tests may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis. 

Treatment of Pica in Cats
Treatment of pica in cats is often complex and multi-layered, and consultation with a veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment for your cat is recommended. The following are some protocols that can help:

Diet

If pica stems from a nutritional deficiency, then consult with your veterinarian and consider altering your cat’s diet to a high-quality, commercially fed cat food or prescription-based food such as Royal Canin®/MD Calm or Hill’s c/d MultiCare. These diets, which contain nutrients like hydrolyzed milk protein and L-tryptophan, also help decrease stress in cats. 

Medication

Certain medications are often prescribed to aid in eliminating or treating compulsive or anxiety-related behaviors. Partner with your veterinarian to find the correct drug, dose, and frequency, then adhere to all follow-up appointments, as these drugs often require monitoring bloodwork.

Other medications such as dewormers and supplements (EFAs, omega-3, EPA, and DHA) may be recommended to aid brain health and improve cognition, and also probiotics and prebiotics to improve gut health. 

Enrichment and Exercise

To help curb pica that stems from boredom and anxiety, you can provide some new activities that help to engage or calm your cat, such as:


	
	Teaching your cat how to walk on a leash, or playing with them more often
	
	
	Installing a “catio,” or more perches or cat trees in your home
	
	
	Using feeder puzzles or toys
	


You may also want to consider more chew toys as suitable alternatives.

Stress can be a major factor in inappropriate behavior in cats. Sometimes just moving the furniture around can put them in a bewildered mood.

By making sure your cat has easy access to plenty of litter boxes, and their food and water bowls, and ensuring positive cat-to-cat interactions within the home, you help keep your cat’s stress levels down.

Calming products such as a synthetic pheromone spray, collar, or diffuser, may also be helpful in decreasing stress in the home.

Avoidance/Prevention

Pica-proofing your home and preventing access to your cat’s preferred items can certainly curb this behavior. While easier said than done, using baby gates, shutting doors, closing trash cans and cupboards, and even using a harness and leash when supervised can prevent a trip to the emergency room. 

Deterrents

No-chew sprays can be used as a deterrent for preferred objects. Additionally, canned air or loud noises such as yelling “No!” or shaking a can of rocks when caught in the act can be effective at deterring the behavior.

Natural Remedies for Pica in Cats

Unfortunately, there is not a lot of research to show whether natural remedies can aid in eliminating pica behavior. As for other home remedies, be careful with over-the-counter products, as cats are extremely sensitive to many, and toxicities can develop even with the smallest of doses, including essential oils.

Always discuss with your veterinarian the proposed benefits and risks of any home remedies before you try them with your cat.

Recovery and Management of Pica in Cats
Pica can be a difficult and challenging condition to treat, let alone manage, and being patient and working closely with your veterinarian while being open to trying different recommendations is paramount to success. Fortunately, for most cats this condition can be managed effectively, while most kittens simply grow out of the behavior. 

If you catch your cat in the act, redirecting the behavior toward something else or offering a tasty treat may be enough to curb the behavior in the moment.

Limiting or blocking your cat’s access to preferred items can also be a simple way to keep your cat safe.

Should you notice your cat ingesting anything inappropriate, an immediate trip to the veterinarian for treatment may prevent a costly surgery.

Be vigilant for signs of a gastrointestinal obstruction, which can include lethargy, decreased appetite or thirst, failure to pass stool or straining while defecating, and vomiting.

186,Peritonitis in Cats,"What Is Peritonitis in Cats?
Peritonitis is inflammation (swelling) in the peritoneal, or abdominal, cavity. It contains all the abdominal organs, including the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, small and large intestines, kidneys, and adrenal glands.

The abdominal cavity and organs are lined with a thin membrane called the peritoneum. This membrane supports abdominal organs and acts as a passageway for nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels and nodes.

When the peritoneal cavity is injured, this membrane becomes inflamed. The inflammation can range from slight to severe, depending on the underlying cause. This condition is usually quite painful, but a veterinarian can investigate the cause and provide proper treatment.

Symptoms of Peritonitis in Cats
Common symptoms of peritonitis in cats include:


	
	Abdominal pain: You may notice your cat vocalizing when you pick them up, or they may have a bloated, firm abdomen and not move around much due to discomfort.
	
	
	Increased heart rate or breathing rate, often associated with discomfort
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Restlessness or not being able to get into a comfortable position. Your cat may also get into a stretching position where their head is lowered and rear end is up; this helps relieve pressure from the abdominal organs.
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy/weakness/collapse
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Jaundice: Yellow discoloration of the skin, eyes, and ears can be a sign of specific types of peritonitis associated with liver/gallbladder disease or certain viruses, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).
	


Causes of Peritonitis in Cats
Any foreign material or infections released into the peritoneal cavity cause irritation and start a systemic inflammatory response. This causes white blood cells to move into the peritoneal cavity, as well as more leaking of the blood vessels and lymphatics in the region.

The loss of fluid, white blood cells, and proteins into the abdomen decreases the movement of oxygenated blood through body tissues and organs. This eventually leads to cell death and organ failure if untreated or, unfortunately, sometimes even with treatment.

Causes of peritonitis in cats include:


	
	Spread of infection through the bloodstream: bacterial, fungal, or viral (for example, FIP)
	
	
	Opening of surgery sites in the gastrointestinal tract: This leads to leakage of material from the digestive tract and bacteria into the abdominal cavity.
	
	
	Wounds that penetrate the abdomen
	
	
	Liver abscesses (walled-off infections)
	
	
	Blunt-force trauma to the abdomen: This leads to rupture of viscous (or balloon-like) organs such as the gallbladder, common bile duct, or urinary bladder. This fluid leakage encourages inflammation and bacterial contamination.
	
	
	Severe pancreatitis
	
	
	Pyometra (infected uterus in female cats that are not spayed)
	
	
	Cysts or abscesses in the prostate (in male cats): This is rare.
	


 How Veterinarians Diagnose Peritonitis in Cats
Your veterinarian will take a thorough history and do a complete physical examination to look for the underlying cause of peritonitis. Full blood work—including a complete blood count, biochemistry panel, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis—is often the first step.

Chest and abdominal X-rays are often the next steps to assess for fluid/gas in the abdomen and any obvious masses or foreign objects. Abdominal ultrasound is used to check all the abdominal organs for disease, leakage, or tumors.

If the vet finds fluid, they will usually take a sample with a needle, often with ultrasound guidance. This fluid is examined and sent to a laboratory for evaluation of blood, protein, bacteria, fungus, white blood cells, and cancerous cells.

If no fluid is noted, a peritoneal lavage may be considered. Sterile fluid is put into the abdomen to wash the lining of the peritoneal cavity. It is then removed from the abdomen to test for cells.

Treatment of Peritonitis in Cats
Cats with peritonitis should be hospitalized for the right fluid therapy and pain relief, as this is a painful disease. Specific therapy depends on the underlying cause:


	
	Spread of infection through the bloodstream: Treatment includes surgery in some instances, as well as antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral therapy.
	
	
	Opening of surgery sites in the gastrointestinal tract: The vet will conduct surgical exploration to find the source of infection and repair the sites. Fluid therapy, pain relief, and antibiotic therapy is given at the vet clinic.
	
	
	Wounds that penetrate the abdomen: Surgical exploration is done to find the source of trauma, and repairs are made as needed. Fluid therapy, pain relief, and antibiotic therapy is given at the vet clinic.
	
	
	Liver abscesses (walled-off infections): Treatment will include surgical exploration and/or drainage of the abscess as well as antibiotic and fluid therapy.
	
	
	Blunt-force trauma to the abdomen: The vet will do surgery to find the source of the leakage and make repairs. They will then give fluid therapy, pain relief, and antibiotic therapy.
	
	
	Severe pancreatitis: This is treated at the vet hospital with intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, pain medication, anti-emetics, and antacid therapy.
	
	
	Pyometra (infected uterus): The recommended treatment is surgical removal of the uterus to take out the source of infection, followed by fluid and antibiotic therapy.
	
	
	Cysts or abscesses in the prostate: Treatment will be surgical exploration and/or drainage of the abscess as well as antibiotic and fluid therapy.
	


Recovery and Management of Peritonitis in Cats
It can take days to months for a cat to recover from peritonitis, and unfortunately, peritonitis can worsen even with the right diagnosis and therapy. Peritonitis can be fatal, and it usually is if left untreated.

If surgery is required to treat your cat, post-operative care is needed to heal from the surgery itself and will be at least two weeks long. Healing time is necessary for any underlying trauma also. It is important to give your cat pain and antibiotic medications at the times your veterinary team tells you to avoid unnecessary pain or resistance to therapies.

Ensuring that your cat is eating well is important, and you will probably need to feed them a bland diet for a few days to a few weeks as their abdomen heals. These diets may be recommended as lifelong treatment in certain cases of peritonitis.

187,Pennyroyal Oil Poisoning in Cats,"Pennyroyal Oil from Poisonous Plant for Cats



Pennyroyal oil is derived from plants within the mint family known as Labiatae. It is frequently used in flea powders, sprays, and in fragrances. It can be toxic to cats, particularly when ingested.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms expected with pennyroyal oil poisoning include:




	Listlessness
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Coughing up blood
	Difficulty breathing
	Bloody nose
	Lethargy
	Coma
	Seizures
	Death




Causes



The active poison in pennyroyal oil is a chemical known as pulegone, which is toxic to the liver and can cause severe liver damage.



Diagnosis



Physical examination findings consistent with pennyroyal oil poisoning together with a history of exposure to plants, or flea products containing pennyroyal oil may prompt suspicion of toxicity.



Blood tests reveal abnormalities consistent with liver damage, including elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartine aminotransferase, gamma-glyamyl transferase) and evidence of bleeding (anemia and prolonged clotting times.)



Evidence of hemorrhage (bleeding) may be seen in internal organs, such as the lungs, liver and kidneys.



A definitive diagnosis may be obtained by finding pulegone on gas chromatography (a specialized laboratory test that analyzes for specific chemicals.)







Treatment



Vomiting can be induced if the cat is not comatose, having respiratory difficulties or having seizures. Gastric lavage (washing out the stomach) may be performed and activated charcoal is frequently administered to bind the toxin.



Bathing with a mild shampoo to remove any pennyroyal oil on the skin and hair coat is recommended.



Fluid therapy may be necessary along with supportive nursing care. N-acetylcysteine may be recommended as well as liver protectants such as S-Adenosylmethionine, Ursodeoxycholic acid, or vitamin E. Gastrointestinal protectants such as cimetidine and/or carafate and antiemetic medications to control vomiting may also be used. Antibiotics are frequently administered also.



Prevention                



Use precaution when applying flea products containing pennyroyal oil on cats. Apply only to areas of your cat's body where it cannot be licked off, and if you have multiple cats, keep them separated until the product has dried completely. Be sure to follow label directions carefully to avoid overdosing.



Also, keep cats away from garden plants and other products which contain pennyroyal oil. Though pennyroyal oil poisoning is rare, it is believed that cats may be particularly susceptible."," and Types

188,Pelger-Huët Anomaly in Cats,"Pelger-Huët anomaly is an inherited disorder in which the neutrophils become hyposegmented (i.e., the nucleus of the cells has only two lobes or no lobes at all). For the most part, this is a harmless disorder which affects domestic shorthair cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
There are two types of this benign defect: heterozygous and homozygous. The heterozygous version is more common and is recognized because the cat's mature neutrophils resemble bands (slightly immature neutrophils) and metamyelocytes (a predecessor of granular leukocytes). Heterozygous anomaly is not associated with immunodeficiency, with predisposition to infection, or with abnormalities of leukocyte (white blood cell) function. Conversely, the homozygous anomaly is usually lethal in utero. Cats that survive may have leukocytes with round to oval nuclei on a stained blood smear.  
 
Skeletal abnormalities and abnormal development of cartilage were reported in one stillborn homozygous kitten; however, a direct link with Pelger-Huët anomaly has not been conclusively confirmed. 
 
Causes
 
Limited breeding studies may suggest autosomal (non-sex linked) dominant transmission of the anomaly in cats. 
 
Diagnosis
 
In most cases, veterinarians discover the anomaly in your cat by accident while conducting routine blood tests. On a stained blood smear, nuclear hyposegmentation of neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes will be visible, whereby the nucleus of the cells has only two lobes or no lobes at all. The hereditary nature of disease is revealed by examination of blood smears from parents and siblings. 


 


Treatment
 
No treatment is required, as there is clinical disease associated with Pelger-Huët anomaly.
 
Living and Management
 
If breeding is a concern, genetic counseling can help with eliminating the trait from future generations."," and Types

189,Pediatric Behavior Problems in Cats,"Behavioral Problems in Cats (or Kittens)



Pediatric behavior problems refer to undesirable behaviors exhibited by kittens between birth and puberty. It is important to address this as early as possible, because behaviors acquired during this age range may be difficult to change later. Preventative measures to avoid such behaviors are essential, as kittens are very vulnerable to physiological and environmental influences.



The most common problems are related to play, fearfulness, defensive aggression, and elimination (i.e., urinating and defecating in the house, also known as house-soiling). While there are no breeds known to be especially inclined to certain behavioral issues, there may be some genetic factors, as it is believed that parental influence may increase the odds of fearfulness in kittens.



Symptoms and Types



Issues involving play may include increased roughness, such as fully extended claws and increased biting. Fear and defensive behavioral problems may include hiding, fleeing, and aggression. These behaviors are characterized by hissing, flattening the ears, and dilated pupils. Elimination problems refer to a problem with litter-box use, including house-soiling, urinating or defecating in the house, or in other unsuitable areas.



Causes



While many behavior problems in kittens are species-typical, there are some causes that can worsen behavioral issues, many of them related to treatment by people, or to the kitten’s general environment. One cause for over aggressiveness, such as attacking people, may be an absence of other outlets for play. For example, an orphaned, hand-reared kitten that has had no other cats to play with will lack the social skills it would have learned though pretend aggression play with its litter mates. Rough play may also be inadvertently encouraged due to the kitten being teased by people. Likewise, fear and defensive behavior problems may be the result of rough handling by people, often related to correction techniques (e.g., if a person spanks, shocks, yells at, hits, or chases the kitten).



Diagnosis



Diagnosis is often largely based on a historical examination of the patient’s past behavior, because a physical examination is generally normal and will reveal nothing out of the ordinary. Some behaviors may be examined by testing your kitten’s reactions to various stimuli. One test may include a urine analysis, as extremely frightened kittens may have elevated levels of glucose and other specific substances in their urine. If a serious issue with the nervous system is suspected, further diagnostic tests will be necessary.



 



Treatment



Any behavioral problems in kittens aside from those that might stem from a serious neurological problem (which is unlikely) can be treated at home. Medication should not be necessary, except in rare cases of extreme anxiety. Specific measures that should be undertaken depend on the behavior exhibited by your kitten.



If aggressive play directed towards people is an issue, the most effective treatment is to acquire an additional kitten for your kitten to play with. Do not hit, kick, or snap the kitten on the nose, as this often elicits more aggressive behavior. Trimming the claws can help reduce damage to people and objects. If your kitten is exhibiting aggressive behavior toward other cats in the household, it might help to take a more proactive role with your kitten. Daily interactive play, using stimulating toys or objects that move, is advised. Toys on strings can entice the kitten to play peacefully.



If your kitten is exhibiting fearful and defensive behaviors, it should be exposed to people gradually, and generally kept in a calm environment. Most importantly, let your kitten make the advances -- avoid scaring it by attempting to hold it if it does not want to be held, or continuing to hold it if it is uncomfortable. If fearful or defensive behaviors are a result of early trauma, the stimulus responsible for eliciting the fearful behavior should be identified.



Modification of handling techniques, such as punishment methods, is imperative. Your veterinarian can recommend behavior modification techniques that will not harm the kitten, or cause further psychological damage.



Living and Management



Make any necessary environmental changes, as recommended by your veterinarian. A healthy diet is also a good plan for ensuring normal development and behavior.



A check-in with your veterinarian to report improvement, or lack thereof, can be conducted over the phone, or during subsequent visits.



Prevention



Behavioral problems can be prevented. Kittens should be exposed to positive experiences with people when they are between the ages of three to seven weeks, and owners with children should prohibit roughhousing with kittens. Avoid punishing your kitten, as this can lead to fear, anxiety, and defensive aggressive behavior. Consult your veterinarian for proper training and handling techniques for young cats if you are in doubt.

190,Pectus Excavatum in Cats,"What Is Pectus Excavatum in Cats?
Pectus excavatum, Latin for “hollow breast,” describes a chest wall deformity where the rib cartilage and sternum (chest bone) are not formed correctly. This condition may also be called flat-chested syndrome in kittens, or funnel chest. It is an extremely rare condition in cats.

This congenital (present from birth) defect occurs during fetal development and results in the ribs and sternum not forming properly. The result is a concave or sunken chest wall, starting at approximately the third to fifth rib and extending to the tip of the sternum. The abnormally shaped chest space causes the heart to be moved to the left side of the chest cavity, causing squeezing of the right side of the heart. Parts of the lungs are also squeezed, resulting in decreased lung function.

Although kittens are born with this defect, clinical symptoms are not always noticed right away. Mild symptoms can worsen as the kitten grows, but once growth is done, any symptoms already present tend to settle at a certain level. In severe cases, breathing or heart problems can occur from a very young age.
Symptoms of Pectus Excavatum in Cats
While some kittens with pectus excavatum may appear normal, symptoms may include:


	Palpable concavity of the chest wall
	Trouble breathing
	Increased breathing rate
	Failure to thrive or inadequate growth rate
	Coughing
	Increased heart rate
	Cyanosis (blue-tinted skin from lack of oxygen)
	Heart murmur
	Exercise intolerance

Causes of Pectus Excavatum in Cats
The exact cause of pectus excavatum in cats is unknown. Because pectus excavatum is a congenital defect (occurring in the growing fetus), genetic factors may be at play. Bengal and Burmese cat breeds seem to have a predisposition to developing pectus excavatum.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Pectus Excavatum in Cats
Pectus excavatum is often diagnosed during a physical exam and feeling of the chest wall. X-rays and a CT scan of the chest can be done to confirm the diagnosis and find the severity of the problem. The CT scan can be particularly useful in showing the amount the heart has been moved (and potential heart dysfunction), which doesn’t always match the amount of skeletal deformity.

Other congenital defects can occur along with pectus excavatum and may need echocardiography or other testing.
Treatment of Pectus Excavatum
In cats not showing symptoms, treatment may not be necessary, but for patients showing clinical symptoms, treatment of pectus excavatum involves surgical repair of the chest wall deformity. Surgical repair is most often done by a surgical specialist at either a veterinary medical school or specialty referral hospital.

There are three types of surgical repair: external splinting, internal splinting, and a combination of external splinting combined with pinning of the sternum.

The external splinting technique is recommended for symptomatic kittens whose bones and cartilage of the chest are still flexible. External splinting involves using stitches to attach a splint to the chest wall. The splint then applies gentle and constant force to the sternum to correct the deformity. The splint is worn for four to eight weeks. If external splinting doesn’t fix the problem, internal splinting is recommended.

Internal splinting involves inserting a plate in the cat’s body, attaching it to the inside of the sternum. The plate can act as a bridge between the deformed and nondeformed parts of the sternum. The plate helps move the deformed sternum ventrally (outward), to allow for a normal increase of space in the chest cavity, and to fix any heart displacement. In some cases, muscle attachments or pieces of bone or cartilage may need to be removed to help with plate placement and sternal repositioning. A chest tube manages air and fluid buildup in the chest cavity during the recovery process. Because of the invasiveness of the surgery, recovery involves 24-hour monitoring in an intensive care unit where the patient is given IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain medication. The cat is also watched for post-operative breathing and heart complications.

A combination of internal surgery followed by external splinting may be required for some patients.
Recovery and Management of Pectus Excavatum in Cats
Recovery and management of pectus excavatum depends on the severity of the abnormality and what methods were used for repair. During recovery, pain medications are given to keep the cat comfortable. Antibiotics may also be used to prevent or treat infection.

External splints are worn for four to eight weeks, and the cat is examined weekly to make sure they are healing well. X-rays are also taken periodically to check the patient’s progress.
Pectus Excavatum in Cats FAQsCan pectus excavatum in cats go away on its own?Unfortunately, no. Cats who show symptoms need surgery to recover.
What happens if pectus excavatum in cats is left untreated?In asymptomatic cats, treatment may not be necessary. However, asymptomatic patients should be watched closely for clinical symptoms. In cats who show symptoms of heart or lung problems, failure to treat pectus excavatum could result in severe illness or death.

192,Parasitic Stomach Worm (Ollulanis) Infection Cats,"Ollulanis Tricuspis Infection in Cats

Ollulanis infection is a parasitic worm infection that occurs mainly in cats. It is caused by Ollulanus tricuspis, which spreads in the environment through the vomit of other infected hosts and goes on to take up residence in the stomach lining. Ollulanus tricuspis is a small nematode parasite which lays its eggs in the mucosal lining of the stomach wall, where it irritates the stomach, inducing vomiting in the cat and further spreading into the environment and into other hosts. These infections are commonly seen in colonies of cats, as well as in stray cats in urban areas that are heavily populated with cats and in cats that are frequently outdoors. Even captive cheetahs, lions, and tigers are susceptible to this infection.

The adult worms coil into the stomach's inner lining, causing ulcers, inflammation, and fibrosis (abnormal development of fibrous tissue).

Symptoms and Types


    Vomiting (chronic)
    Poor appetite
    Weight loss
    Death due to chronic stomach 	infection



Causes

Ollulanus tricuspis worm infection is usually transmitted through ingesting the vomit contents from an infected host.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including background medical history, details of the onset of symptoms, your cat's usual routine, and any events that may have led to your cat's condition. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination, including a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of these laboratory tests may reveal dehydration due to vomiting and diarrhea. 

Your veterinarian will also examine your cat's feces and vomit contents for evidence of parasites. In this case, the ollulanis worm is digested if it enters into the digestive tract, so an analysis of the vomit is the only way your veterinarian can make a more conclusive diagnosis. Unless you are able to take a fresh sample of your cat's vomit with you to the veterinary clinic, your veterinarian will need to induce vomiting by giving your cat vomit inducing medications, or the doctor may decide to perform a stomach lavage, which gathers the contents of the stomach by washing them out.

An abdominal ultrasound may also reveal a thickening of the stomach wall due to chronic irritation and infection.



Treatment

Drugs to kill parasites residing in the stomach may be used, but often, complete removal is not achieved on the initial treatment. Symptoms may improve after the first treatment. You will need to revisit your veterinarian to retest for the presence of the stomach worm.

Living and Management

Watch your cat for vomiting or other symptoms which might show recurrence and call your veterinarian to schedule a second round of treatment. If your cat is vomiting, immediately remove the vomit contents, using strong cleaners to clean the area. Keep a sample of the vomit, if possible, to give to your veterinarian. The stomach worm can live for up to 12 days in the vomit content, so it is not necessary to do anything special with the saved contents immediately. If there are other cats in the home, do not allow them to go near the vomit contents."," and Types

193,Parasitic Infection of the Respiratory Tract in Cats,"Respiratory Parasites in Cats



Respiratory parasites can be worms, or insects such as maggots or mites that live in the respiratory system, either in the passages or in the blood vessels. The infestation might affect the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, throat, and windpipe, or the lower respiratory passage, including the bronchi and lungs.



Such parasites affect all of the host’s systems: the respiratory system, the cardiovascular system (the heart), the circulatory system, and the endocrine system (the liver and kidneys).



Animals that live in multiple pet households, and pets living in unsanitary conditions have a higher risk of transmission. Exposure to the infected feces of other animals that are carriers of the parasite can also make an animal more susceptible. This can include being in an environment such as a shelter or boarding facility, but your cat is also more at risk if it goes outdoors, as it has more opportunities to come into contact with other animals and their feces and urine.



These parasites often begin their life cycles in shellfish, crabs, lizards, and worms, spreading to other animals opportunistically.



Symptoms and Types




	May show few or no signs
	Sneezing
	Runny nose
	Bloody nose
	Wheezing
	Harsh lung sounds
	Behavioral changes (brain migration of parasites)
	Coma (brain migration of parasites)




Causes




	Eating earthworms
	Digging or sniffing around rodent burrows
	Touching noses and/or other mucous membranes with infected cats or dogs
	Being sneezed upon by an infected animal
	Eating infected rodents
	Eating infected martens and mink or being exposed to their feces
	Eating infected birds
	Eating sheep offal
	Eating infected crayfish
	Eating snails (uncooked)
	Eating infected ants
	Eating infected cockroaches (roundworms, hookworms)
	Exposure to infected feces of other cats and dogs
	Kittens can be infected prenatally and through their mother’s milk while nursing if the mother is infected




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities, including recent history of boardings, outings, and experiences with other animals or with pests. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical exam on your cat. Standard laboratory work will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis in order to determine the exact origin of the symptoms. A differential diagnosis may find parasites, but it may also find a bacterial respiratory infection.



Your veterinarian will specifically examine your cat's urine and feces for parasite eggs or pieces of parasites. In feces, these are found by microscopically examining a solution of your cat's feces. A sample of sputum (cough discharge) can also be microscopically examined for parasite eggs.





X-ray imaging of the lungs is crucial for visualizing abnormal lung changes that may be indicative of a parasitic infestation. A rhinoscopy or bronchoscopy (direct visualization of the nose and bronchioles with a small camera) is an even better way to look for respiratory parasites.





Treatment



Cats with respiratory parasites are usually treated on an outpatient basis with dewormers. Anti-inflammatory agents are also given to patients to decrease their body’s negative immune reaction to so many dead parasites. Some types of parasites can only be removed surgically one at a time.



If your cat is having trouble breathing, it should be hospitalized and given oxygen therapy until the parasite infestation has been resolved.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to examine your cat's respiratory passages with a bronchoscope and to reexamine fecal and urine samples for parasite eggs. Preventing your cat from eating insects, rodents, and wild animals is the best way of protecting your cat against parasite infections. Also, avoiding contact with unknown cats and dogs, or even separating your own pets (if you have others) when they appear to be ill are some ways in which you can prevent or mitigate a parasitic infection.



Most animals recover well from respiratory parasites, unless the infection has been chronic (long term). If parasites have migrated to the brain, causing your pet to show symptoms of neurological impairment, a cure will not be possible.



If you suspect that your cat is infected with parasites, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. If your cat has already begun to show symptoms of neurological change or degeneration, call your veterinarian for an emergency appointment."," and Types

194,Parasitic Infection (Microsporidiosis Encephalitozoonosis) in Cats,"Encephalitozoonosis (microsporidiosis) in Cats

Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi)  is a protozoal parasitic infection which spreads and creates lesions on the lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain, significantly effecting their ability to function normally. It is rarely seen parasitic infection in cats -- occurring more commonly in rabbits and dogs -- but is still of concern in cats, as cats spend time outdoors with other cats and in environments that are inhabited by other animals, like wild rabbits.

This disease is also commonly called microsporidiosis, as the E. cuniculi is a parasite belonging to the species of microsporidia. It appears to be acquired by the oronasal (mouth and nose) route, when an animal licks/sniffs the spore-infected urine of another animal. For this reason, animals that are kenneled are at greater risk for it. However, because microsporidia can survive for extended periods in the environment, it is reasonable to assume that almost any cat that goes outdoors is susceptible to infection. Conversely, cats that are kept indoors are at a greatly decreased risk of acquiring this parasite.

Treatment is experimental, with supportive therapy being the most dominant treatment. In most cases infected cats will recover fully without medical treatment, but it is often fatal when acquired by kittens (most often acquired while developing in the womb, or while nursing). Kittens may be stillborn, or will die while young from failure to thrive.

In addition, this parasitic infection is zoonotic and is therefore contagious to humans, particularly those who are immunocompromised. Sanitizing the environment is essential; a 70 percent ethanol solution should be used to clean up any infected urine and throughout the cat's living area.

Symptoms and Types

Neonatal 	infection (appears around three weeks of age)

    Stunted 		growth
    Poor 		hair coat, small size
    Failure 		to thrive
    Advances 		to kidney failure
    Neurological 		complications


Adults

    Brain 		abnormalities
    Aggressive 		behavior
    Seizures
    Blindness
    Progress 		to kidney failure


Causes


    E. 	cuniculi 	in spore-infected urine, usually spread/acquired by licking and 	sniffing


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical exam of your cat after taking a complete history from you. You will then need to provide as much background information as possible about your cat's health and all of the symptoms leading up to the visit. If your cat has recently given birth, or you have kittens being treated, the kittens may be very small with a poor, dull-looking hair coats.

Because there are symptoms that are similar to other diseased conditions, such as uncharacteristic aggression, your veterinarian may want to test for rabies, as well as for toxoplasmosis. If your cat is an adult, it may have limited vision, complete blindness, or it may be having occasional seizures. Your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis to see which organs are being most affected by the parasitic infection. The infectious spores can be seen in urine that has been stained to make the spores visible under a microscope.

  

Treatment

Many cats will completely recover by themselves if the infection has not progressed to severe kidney or brain disease. Supportive therapy can be used along with a fungicidal drug until the infection has cleared from the body. If your cat has severe brain or kidney disease it may need to be euthanized.

Living and Management

Avoid all urine from a cat that is sick with this disease.  If possible, you might want to opt to keep your cat at the veterinary clinic until its urine is no longer infectious. If you do keep your cat at home, make sure to keep it in an enclosed area on a slick, easy to sanitize surface. This will allow you to pour the 70 percent ethanol solution over your cat's urine to kill the spores (should it get on the floor). Disposable litter pans and/or disposable litter pan liners can be used to minimize reinfection, and disposable floor coverings and blankets/sheets may be used to help make cleanup more thorough.

Immune-compromised people are most at risk for catching this disease from their pets, so if at all possible, these people should have someone else to take care of their cats until they are no longer infectious, or take all necessary precautions to protect themselves while caring for their cats (e.g., face masks, disposable gloves)."," and Types

195,Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats,"What Is Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats?
Parasitic blood infections are not overly common in cats, but they are important diseases for pet parents to be aware of.

External parasites—such as fleas, ticks, and flies—can cause infection in the blood of cats when they bite or are swallowed. They transmit blood parasites, such as mycoplasma, that are harmful to cats.

When a flea, tick, or fly bites or is swallowed by a cat, the blood parasite it transmits may enter the cat’s red or white blood cells and reproduce, causing infection. These blood parasites change the normal function and number of these cells and may travel to different organs in a cat’s body.

Damage to the cells and organs leads to extreme sickness in affected cats.

Parasitic blood infections should be treated quickly, and many of the symptoms they cause, such as pale gums and breathing difficulties, are considered medical emergencies.

If you notice any abnormal behaviors or new concerning symptoms in your cat, bring them to the veterinarian promptly to be checked.

While most cats recover well from parasitic blood infections, they can be fatal depending on the type and severity of the infection. Your cat has the best chance for recovery from a parasitic blood infection when treatment is started early.

Symptoms of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
Blood infections in cats can cause a variety of symptoms, which may include the following:


	
	Anemia
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Jaundice
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Breathing difficulties
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	


Cats with a weakened immune system or those with an underlying immune function disorder—such as FeLV or FIV—may have more severe symptoms than healthy adult cats.

Causes of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
Cats most commonly develop blood infections after being bitten by a parasite, such as a flea, tick, or fly. Cats who are allowed outside are more likely to get these infections, as they spend more time around parasites that could infect them.

Male cats more commonly develop infections compared to females. This is because male cats are more likely to escape outdoors where they may encounter fleas and ticks.

Also, cats who are not on monthly parasitic protection and those with a weakened immune system are more at risk for bloodborne infections. Certain blood infections—such as mycoplasmas—can also pass from mother to kitten during pregnancy.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
To diagnose a parasitic blood infection, a veterinarian will start with a head-to-toe check of the cat to find any abnormalities, such as pale gums, dehydration, or visible parasites.

Pet parents should share the cat’s thorough medical history to help with a diagnosis. This includes any medications the cat is taking, when symptoms started, if the cat is indoor or outdoor, and if the cat is taking any parasite prevention.

Other testing may include the following:


	
	Complete blood count—A veterinarian takes a small sample of blood from the cat’s vein. This test finds changes to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. A special slide called a blood smear can be viewed under a microscope to identify blood parasites.
	
	
	Serum chemistry—Using a small sample of blood from the cat’s vein, a veterinarian can look for problems in liver and kidney function, glucose levels, and other measurements that may change with an infection.
	
	
	PCR/serology—A special laboratory can use a sample of blood or serum to diagnose a blood infection through specific testing.
	
	
	SNAP® 4Dx—A few drops of blood are mixed with a special solution and then added to a test that finds several parasitic blood infections, including Anaplasma and Ehrlichia in cats.
	


Other diagnostics, such as imaging or other laboratory testing, may be recommended by the veterinarian as well.

Treatment of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
Parasitic blood infections in cats are treated primarily with antibiotics, antiparasitic medications, and supportive care.

Oral doxycycline is an antibiotic that is often used to treat mycoplasma infections in cats. However, it’s been associated with narrowing of the esophagus—so the dose must be followed by a syringe of water. Pet parents should follow their veterinarian’s instructions closely when giving this medication.

Many cats can be treated on an outpatient basis at home. However, if the infection has gone untreated for a while and the cat is very sick, hospitalization and supportive care will be needed.

Supportive care may include fluids given by vein or underneath the skin, anti-inflammatories, steroids, and oxygen therapy depending on the needs of the cat. In cats who are severely anemic, a blood transfusion may be needed for recovery.

Parasitic blood infections can be cured in most cases, but they must be treated right away.

Sometimes treatment cures the acute infection but leaves the cat a chronic carrier of the bacteria. In these cats, less stress and regular preventative veterinary care are important to stop a relapse of symptoms.

Recovery and Management of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
Recovery can take several weeks in affected cats. Sometimes cats will become chronic carriers, especially those with mycoplasma infections, and will later experience a recurrence of symptoms during times of stress.

Although most cats will fully recover with quick treatment and supportive care, one type of blood infection—cytauxzoonosis—is often fatal.

To help with recovery, pet parents should offer a private, quiet space for cats getting treatment for a parasitic blood infection.

Some cats like going to their carrier for quiet time, so pet parents can also try keeping a cat carrier opened and easily accessible for recovering cats to spend time in. Keeping the affected cat in one area of the home and away from other pets can help lower stress and make recovery faster.

Prevention of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats
Pet parents should keep their cats on monthly flea and tick prevention year-round to lower the risk of blood infections caused by these parasites. These products are available by prescription through your veterinarian and include Bravecto®Plus and Revolution® Plus.

Additionally, keeping cats indoors lowers the risk that they will encounter fleas, ticks, and other insects that could cause disease.

196,Parasite Infection (Leishmaniasis) in Cats,"Leishmaniasis in Cats

Brought on by the protozoan parasite Leishmania, leishmaniasis causes two types of disease in cats: a cutaneous (skin) reaction and a visceral (abdominal organ) reaction, which is also known as black fever, the most severe form of leishmaniasis.

The infection is acquired when sandflies transmit the flagellated  parasites into the skin of a host. The incubation period from infection  to symptoms is generally between one month to several years. Although  relatively rare in cats, when it does occur it often localizes in the  skin. There is no age, gender, or breed predilection; however, males are  more likely to have a visceral reaction.

The main organ systems affected are the skin, kidneys, spleen, liver, eyes, and joints. There is also commonly a skin reaction, with lesions on the skin, and hair loss. There is marked tendency to hemorrhage.

Affected cats in the U.S. are frequently found to have  acquired the Leishmania infection in another country, notably the Mediterranean basin, Portugal, and Spain. There have also been sporadic cases confirmed in Switzerland, northern France, and the Netherlands, and endemic areas found in South and Central America, and in southern Mexico. Endemic cases in Texas have also been reported in cat populations there as well.

It is important to note that leishmaniasis is a zoonotic infection, and the organisms residing in the lesions can be communicated to humans.

Symptoms and Types

Visceral – affects organs of the abdominal cavity

    Severe weight loss
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Diarrhea
    Tarry feces (less common)
    Vomiting
    Nose bleed
    Exercise intolerance


Cutaneous - affects the skin

    Hyperkeratosis — most prominent 	finding; excessive epidermal scaling with thickening, depigmentation 	(loss of skin color), and chapping of the muzzle and footpads
    Alopecia — dry, brittle hair coat 	with symmetrical hair loss
    Nodules usually develop on the 	skin surface


Causes

Traveling to endemic regions (usually the Mediterranean), where the cat can be exposed to sandflies -- a Leishmania host  -- is the  most common way of contracting the infection. However, receiving a  transfusion from another infected animal can also lead to leishmaniasis.



Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will be looking for evidence of such diseases as lupus, cancer, and distemper, among other possible causes for the symptoms. Tissue samples from the skin, spleen, bone marrow, or lymph nodes will be taken for laboratory culturing, as well as fluid aspirates. Since there are often related lesions on the skin's surface, a skin biopsy will be in order as well.

Most animals with leishmaniasis have high levels of protein and gammaglobulin, as well as high liver enzyme activity. Even so, your veterinarian will need to eliminate tick fever as the cause of the symptoms, and may test specifically for lupus in order to rule it out or confirm it as a cause.

Treatment

Unless your cat is extremely ill, it will be treated as an outpatient. If it is emaciated and chronically infected, you may need to consider euthanasia because the prognosis is very poor for such animals. If your cat is not severely infected, your veterinarian will prescribe a high-quality protein diet, one that is designed specifically for renal insufficiency if necessary. If your cat has a single dermal nodule, it is best to surgically remove it.

This is a zoonotic infection, and the organisms residing in the lesions can be communicated to humans. These organisms will never be entirely eliminated, and relapse, requiring treatment, is inevitable.

There are medications that can be helpful in treating symptoms and in addressing the disease. Your veterinarian will advise you on the best course.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat for clinical improvement and for identification of organisms in repeat biopsies. You can expect a relapse a few months to a year after the initial therapy; your veterinarian will want to recheck your cat's condition at least every two months after completion of the initial treatment. The prognosis for a successful cure is very guarded."," and Types

197,Paraneoplastic Syndromes in Cats,"Conditions Due to Abnormal Secretions from a Tumor in Cats

Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) are a group of disorders that result from  the abnormal secretions of a hormone or hormone-like product from a  cancerous tumor, or from the body's immune response to the tumor. These  secretions affect the related tissues or organs (that is, the tissues  and organs that are directly related to the affected organ) and generate  an abnormal clinical response in cats dealing with cancer.

Such a response is not due to the invasiveness of the primary tumor, but is a secondary response to the abnormal secretions that are produced by the malignant or benign tumor. Symptoms depend on the response of the tissue or organ that is being targeted.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms will vary greatly depending on the type of tumor and on the organ system being affected by the abnormal secretions from such tumors. This type of disorder is most commonly related to a malignant tumor, but it can also result from a benign tumor that is secreting hormones. This latter type of tumor is rarer than the malignant type, in this instance. The most common types of PNS in cats will display as symptoms of anorexia – a complete loss of appetite, in a wasting away of the body, and in dermatological disorders.


    Hair loss (alopecia)
    Exfoliative dermatosis
    Itch rash (pruritis); may present 	as severe ulcers or infections of the skin
    Fragile skin
    Fever
    Anemia
    Loss of appetitie (anorexia)
    Physical wasting and loss of 	weight (cachexia)
    Stomach and intestinal ulcers
    Draining nodules on the toes
    Low body glucose levels 	(hypoglycemia)


Other symptoms depend on the type, 	location, and stage of tumor.

Causes

Tumor and/or presence of cancer in the body; hormone or hormone-like secretions released by the tumor. Some of the cancers that may be affecting the cat are squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the bile duct, pancreatic carcinoma, feline thymoma, or adenocarcinoma of the bronchia and alveoli (bronchoalveolar) in the lungs.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a detailed physical examination. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These laboratory tests will return evidence of an immune system response to the cancer, and will also measure the effects the tumor secretions are having on various tissues and organs in the body.



Imaging studies will include radiographs of the thoracic (chest) cavity to rule out cancer in the lungs, and of the abdomen to confirm or rule out cancer of the organs situated therein. Ultrasound imaging will also be used to examine the structure of the internal organs and the adrenal glands. Biopsies of affected organs may be taken for further diagnosis, and if skin disorders are present, samples will betaken of the affected areas.

Treatment

Treatment of such disorders is highly individualized and will depend on the type, location, and stage of the tumor. If your cat has been suffering from anorexia and wasting, it will need to be placed on nutritional support and stabilized before further invasive treatments can begin. Invasive treatment is necessary, under the circumstances, as the type of tumor is most likely of a highly malignant nature. Your veterinarian will remove the tumor, if possible. Chemotherapy may also be an option, if the tumor is of the type that is likely to respond to chemical therapy. Your doctor will discuss these options with you.

For some patients, where the underlying tumor cannot be removed or treated, management of the clinical signs and treatments to improve the quality of life will be planned.

Living and Management

The overall prognosis depends on the underlying tumor and its treatment, but in general,  the malignant nature of the tumors that cause paraneoplastic syndromes often leads to a fatal outcome."," depend on the response of the tissue or organ that is being targeted.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms will vary greatly depending on the type of tumor and on the organ system being affected by the abnormal secretions from such tumors. This type of disorder is most commonly related to a malignant tumor, but it can also result from a benign tumor that is secreting hormones.

198,Paralysis of the Jaw in Cats,"Trigeminal Neuritis in Cats
 
Trigeminal nerve neuritis (inflammation) is characterized by the sudden onset of the inability to close the jaw owing to dysfunction of the mandibular (jaw) branch of the trigeminal nerves (one of the cranial nerves). This may be due to nerve injury, which ranges from neuritis, demyelination (loss of the fatty sheath around the nerve which helps conduct the signal), and sometimes to fiber degeneration of all the branches of the trigeminal nerve and the nerve cell body. 

This condition is uncommon in cats when compared to dogs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Acute onset of a dropped jaw
    Inability to close the mouth
    Drooling
    Difficulty in getting food in the mouth
    Messy eating
    No loss of feeling in the jaw or face
    Swallowing remains normal                 

 
Causes
 
The underlying cause of trigeminal nerve neuritis is currently uknown, though it is possibly immune-mediated.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background medical history, onset of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. Rabies is one of the more important disease conditions that will need to be ruled out. Diagnostic imaging like X-ray will be used to examine the skull and jaw bones, and bone marrow core biopsies and muscle biopsies can be used to rule out other possibilities for disease. 
 
Treatment
 
The most effective treatment is supportive care. Your cat will need assistance with eating and drinking. If you are able to provide sufficient care at home, your cat may be treated as an outpatient, but if you cannot care for your cat, it will need supportive nutritional care in the veterinary hospital so that it is receiving adequate nutrients.
 
If your cat is still able to lap and swallow food that is offered, you can use a large syringe that is placed in the corner of the mouth to feed the cat water and pureed foods, with the cat's head slightly elevated so that it can swallow easily. Fluids can also be administered subcutaneously (under the skin). Feeding tubes are rarely necessary for maintaining adequate food intake, but may be used if your cat is unable to take anything into the mouth or swallow the food that is given. 
 
Living and Management
 
This disease usually spontaneously resolves after two to four weeks. One result of this disease is shrinkage of the muscles used for chewing. Once the condition has stabilized and your cat is able to move its jaws normally again, you can help your cat to rebuild the jaw muscles. Your veterinarian will recommend exercises for doing this based on your cat's overall health and age."," and Types

199,Paralysis-inducing Spinal Cord Disease in Cats,"Myelopathy–Paresis/Paralysis in Cats



Myelopathy refers to any disease affecting the spinal cord. Depending upon the severity and location of the disease, it can cause weakness (paresis) or complete loss of voluntary movements (paralysis). Paresis or paralysis may affect all four of the cat's limbs (teraparesis/plegia), the hind limbs (para-), front limbs (hemi-), or just one limb (mono-).



Symptoms and Types



The severity and extent of the spinal cord disease, as mentioned above, will determine how severe the weakness and paralysis is. However, external stimuli will also often increase the effects. Such symptoms include:




	Uncoordinated movements
	Loss of muscle bulk
	Decreased tension of muscles (Hypotonus)
	Increased tension of muscles (Hypertonus)
	Bowel movement and urinating problems (fecal and urinary incontinence, respectively)




Causes




	Inherited
	Blood supply deficiency (ischemia)
	Neoplastic tumor(s)--lymphoma, meningiomas, histiocytic tumors, etc.
	Inflammatory and infectious—Bacterial meningomyelitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, FeLV
	Traumatic—secondary to bite wounds, vertebral fractures, or intervertebral disc disease




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which are typically within normal ranges. Your veterinarian will also test the cat for various infectious diseases like Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).



For further evaluation, the veterinarian may conduct CT-scan, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and X-rays on the spine, which often reveal underlying problems like fractures, inflammation, and tumors. Meanwhile, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, a protective and nourishing fluid that circulate around brain and spinal cord, may be sent to a laboratory to test for infectious organisms.





Treatment



The course of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the myeolopathy. For instance, cases involve trauma may require hospitalization to reset fractures, while infections may require corticosteroids. Just as important is the management of the cat during recovery.



Living and Management



Due to urination and fecal elimination problems, cats with myelopathy typically need someone to express the bladder every six to eight hours, as well as clean and dry the scalded area. If the cat is unable to sit, it should be turned every six hours to prevent decubital ulcers.



Physiotherapy is also very important for quick recovery and to prevent further muscle wasting and weakness. This can either be done at home or under the supervision of a veterinary physiotherapist. At-home care will require a detailed management plan, which will provided by your veterinarian.

200,Paralysis in Cats,"What is Paralysis in Cats?
Paralysis is the medical term for a loss of voluntary movement. A cat’s nervous system—made up of the brain, spinal cord and nerves—is much like a highway. The moving cars are the electrical signals sent from the brain to the rest of the body to tell it what to do: walk, jump, eat meow, etc. When that highly coordinated system is affected, the signals get lost or blocked. As a result, the affected body parts do not work as intended.

Paralysis and paresis often manifest as weakened or diminished movement, muscle fatigue, weak reflexes, decreased range of motion or decreased ability to perform certain motions. Paralysis can be broken down by body part:


	
	Hemiparesis: weakness on one side of the body
	
	
	Hemiplegia: inability to move one side of the body
	
	
	Paraparesis: weakness in the back legs
	
	
	Paraplegia: inability to move the back legs
	
	
	Tetraparesis: weakness in all limbs
	
	
	Tetraplegia: inability to move all limbs
	


Other body parts can also become weakened or paralyzed. Laryngeal paralysis is a relatively uncommon condition seen typically in older cats, where the nerves affecting the muscles that open and close the airway are affected. You may notice a change in your cat’s breathing or meow, or a coughing/gagging sound when your cat is eating or drinking.

Symptoms of Paralysis in Cats
Paralysis in cats can occur suddenly or become worse over time. You may notice the following:


	
	A lack of movement in any part of the body, including head, neck and limbs
	
	
	A wobbly gait
	
	
	Falling down
	
	
	Difficulty eating
	
	
	Difficulty drinking
	
	
	Difficulty urinating
	
	
	Difficulty defecating
	
	
	Trouble breathing
	
	
	Dragging limbs across the floor while walking
	


Causes of Paralysis in Cats
Both complete and partial paralysis are essentially due to a blockage in the signaling pathway from the brain to the limbs or body parts. This can be caused by the following:


	
	Cancer, either primary spine or brain cancer, or cancers originally found elsewhere that have spread to the spine or brain. Lymphosarcoma is the most common spinal tumor in cats.
	
	
	Drugs and/or chemicals, such as

	
		
		Hexachlorophene (disinfectant)
		
		
		Succinylcholine (a neuromuscular blocking agent) which prevents the signal from the nerve from reaching the muscle
		
		
		Pesticides
		
		
		Antifreeze
		
	
	
	
	Clot formation, either in the aorta or the spinal cord
	
	
	Infections, such as

	
		
		Cryptococcus
		
		
		Toxoplasmosis
		
		
		Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP in cats)
		
	
	
	
	Intervertebral disc disease
	
	
	Spinal trauma, caused by a motor vehicle accident, fall, projectile or attack
	
	
	Toxins, such as

	
		
		Botulism from eating uncooked or spoiled food
		
		
		Marijuana
		
		
		Tick bites
		
	
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Paralysis in Cats
Your veterinarian will conduct a physical exam, including a more extensive neurological exam aimed at trying to find the portion of the nervous system most likely affected. Following this, your vet may recommend the following:


	
	Blood work, urine testing, and X-rays to assess your cat’s overall condition, identify potential toxins and traumatic causes, and possibly screen for cancer.
	
	
	CSF “tap,” in which a sample of your cat’s spinal fluid is evaluated for the presence of infection or cancer cells.
	
	
	Advanced imaging, such as CT and/or MRI (often performed by a veterinary specialist) to identify spinal and brain disorders.
	
	
	Muscle or nerve biopsies, in which samples of specific tissues are taken and reviewed under a microscope.
	


Treatment of Paralysis in Cats
Caring for paralyzed cats can be extremely challenging, even for the most conscientious owner. Therapy can be classified as either primary or secondary:


	
	Primary treatment is aimed at eliminating or treating the underlying cause. For example, a spinal fracture will require surgery, medical management, and cage rest, whereas paralysis caused by a tick bite would require removal of the tick.
	
	
	Secondary treatment is aimed at improving comfort, controlling pain and inflammation with medication and physical therapy.
	


Management of most cases is done through supportive care and careful attention. Your cat will most likely be hospitalized for several days.

After discharge, follow-up appointments and communication with the veterinary team will be vital to ensure that secondary complications (such as decubital ulcers, urinary tract infections, muscle wasting and pneumonia) do not occur and progress is noted. Frequent turning of the cat and appropriate bedding is helpful to prevent ulcers, and placing extra bedding or “doughnuts” under bony prominences is recommended.

Recovery and Management of Paralysis in Cats
Prognosis for recovery is often correlated to the presence of deep pain. This is a test that can be performed by a veterinarian to assess a cat’s ability to respond to a painful stimulus. The nerves that transmit this information are the most protected, and a lack of response indicates that the damage is extensive and severe enough that sensation will not return. In these cases, your veterinarian may discuss long-term measures including quality of life, emotional well-being and considerations for humane euthanasia.

For cats that do have a deep pain response ‑ and a more favorable prognosis ‑ recovery will be slow and taxing, not only for the cat but also for the pet parent. Keeping your cat as dry and clean as possible will help prevent secondary skin infections and frequent bladder expression can help prevent discomfort and urinary tract infections.

Physical therapy should be implemented where appropriate. Working with a certified rehabilitation veterinarian is often recommended. An individual therapy management plan will be created and the vet will work with you to teach home exercises to limit muscle atrophy, improve your cat’s comfort and restore range of motion. Stretching and massage, acupuncture and laser therapy are other avenues you can explore to alleviate your cat’s pain and discomfort.
Paralysis in Cats FAQsWhat causes sudden paralysis in cats?Other than traumatic injuries and toxins, the most common cause of acute paralysis in cats is feline aortic thromboembolism, or saddle thrombus. This is a painful condition in which your cat will suddenly become lame in the back legs. It is caused by a blood clot that has traveled down the aorta (most likely due to underlying heart disease) and becomes lodged at the point at which the aorta branches into the hind legs. Both legs are usually affected, but it can affect just one.  Blood supply is cut off to the limb(s) which will subsequently feel cold, appear bluish in color and experience muscle stiffness. 
Can a cat recover from hind leg paralysis?As noted regarding saddle thrombus, depending on the severity of the paralysis and the severity of the underlying heart disease, some cats can recover, usually within several weeks to months. However, most cats with this condition may be euthanized given the poor prognosis and potential for recurring episodes and heart failure.
Can a cat recover from paralysis?Depending on the underlying cause and if treated appropriately, some cats can regain function, though there may be lasting complications and long-term effects. The first several hours are the most critical, which is why it’s vital to seek veterinary care as soon as symptoms start. But if progress is seen, then it is generally recommended to continue with treatment. Sadly, some cats will be humanely euthanized as the prognosis is grave and return to function unlikely.
Can worms cause paralysis in cats?Yes. Certain species of worms, such as roundworms and heartworms, can migrate through the nervous system and brain and cause paralysis.

201,Paralysis Due to Spinal Cord Lesion in Cats,"Schiff-Sherrington Phenomenon in Cats

Schiff-Sherrington phenomenon occurs when the spinal cord is transected by an acute, usually severe lesion to the cat's lower back (second lumbar vertebrae), causing exaggerated posturing in the upper extremities (front limb extension). Hind limb paralysis (regarded as the release phenomenon) can also occur due to damage to the border cells and interneurons located in the lumbar spinal cord (mainly L2-4), which normally exert influence on the spinal segments below the transection.

Symptoms and Types


    Unusual gait
    Unable to walk or stand
    Forelimbs are rigidly extended
    Hind limbs show spastic paralysis (upper motor neuron lesion) or flaccidly paralyzed (lower motor neuron lesion)


Causes

Schiff-Sherrington phenomenon may develop due to severe thoracolumbar spinal injuries (such as those brought on by an auto accident) or because of intervertebral disk disease (most common).

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel to rule out other causes associated with your pet's exaggerated posture. 

The most useful tools to visualize the cat's spinal cord, and thereby locate the thoracolumbar lesion, is by taking CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, as well as employing myelography, in which a dye is injected during radiographic examination.



Treatment

Treatment is directed toward repairing the damage caused by the thoracolumbar spinal cord lesion, which may involve spinal surgery. If adequate spinal cord function is restored, Schiff-Sherrington phenomenon can be resolved. However, there is no specific course of treatment currently available.

Living and Management

The exaggerated posture may persist for days up to several weeks, but this is not an indication of a hopeless prognosis. With rapid and aggressive treatment, your pet may recover, especially if the cat can feel pain in its extremities lower than the spinal injury."," and Types

202,Paralysis Due to Spinal Cord Injury in Cats,"Myelomalacia in Cats
 
The terms “myelomalacia” or “hematomyelia” are used to denoted an acute, progressive, and ischemic (due to blockage of blood supply) necrosis of the spinal cord after injuring the spinal cord. The premature death (necrosis) of the spinal cord cells first appears at the site of the injury but progresses forward and backward from the point of injury over time. 
 
Dogs and cats of any age or breed can succumb to this condition.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Paralysis of hind limbs
    Numbness to pain in areas lower than the injury
    Loss of tone and reflexes in hind limbs due to softening of spinal cord (malacia)
    Hyperthermia
    Dilated anus

 
Causes
 

    Type 1 disk disease
    Spinal injury

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. The questions may specifically pertain to accidents or injuries that may have befallen your cat. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may be normal initially, but which may deteriorate as injuries to vital organ worsen.
 
Spinal X-rays and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are other valuable tools for evaluation of structural and functional aspects of spinal cord. These tests may show evidence of herniated disks and vertebral fractures. Your veterinarian will also take cerebrospinal fluid (which protects and nourishes the brain and spinal cord) and will send the sample to laboratory for further evaluation.


 


Treatment
 
Unfortunately, there is no treatment currently available to reverse spinal cord damage. There is also no single therapeutic protocol agreed upon among veterinarian; often, treatment to treat secondary effects will vary from patient to patient. There are some drugs (methylprednisolone sodium succinate, m 21-aminosteroid compounds) that may halt the progression of the disease, but their effectiveness has not been proven.
 
Living and Management
 
The prognosis of cats with myelomalacia is not good. Paralysis is always permanent and many veterinarians will recommend euthanizing the animal so that it does not suffer -- and possibly die from -- respiration difficulties."," and Types

203,Pancreatitis in Cats,"What is Pancreatitis in Cats?
The pancreas is an organ located between the stomach and small intestine. Among its functions, the pancreas produces enzymes needed to digest food, as well as the hormone insulin, that helps to regulate blood sugar. 

When the pancreas becomes inflamed, the digestive enzymes can activate and start irritating the pancreas itself, causing the pancreas to become inflamed. This condition is called pancreatitis. 

In cats, the enzymes can also travel from the pancreas to the gastrointestinal tract and in some situations, this can cause inflammation in the liver, stomach, and small intestine, known as feline triaditis, which in some cases may become life threatening.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Pancreatitis in Cats
When pancreatitis appears suddenly (acute cases), symptoms are typically easy to notice for the pet parent. Symptoms may include: 


	
	Vomiting 
	
	
	Weight loss 
	



	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Diarrhea or soft stool 
	
	
	Abdominal pain 
	


When pancreatitis is chronic, signs may be infrequent and may not be as easily noticeable by the pet parent. Some days the cat may feel fine and other days she may not be as interested in food or may vomit. 

Causes of Pancreatitis in Cats
Although in most cases the underlying cause is unknown, pancreatitis can affect any breed and age of cat. Risk factors for pancreatitis in cats include: 


	
	Obesity 
	
	
	An underlying disease such as diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome or cancer 
	



	
	Infection 
	
	
	Certain drugs 
	


Sometimes, dietary changes or stress can contribute to pancreatitis. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Pancreatitis in Cats
Symptoms of pancreatitis in cats resemble those of other causes, so your veterinarian will likely recommend a baseline blood work and tests to measure the enzyme lipase, which is an enzyme that helps break down fats. High levels of lipase in the blood indicate a higher chance of pancreatitis.  

Results from these tests can help determine treatment or indicate if further tests, such as abdominal x- rays or ultrasound, are necessary. Other tests may include clotting times (determining the time in which it can take for blood to clot; useful in determining if spontaneous hemorrhage will occur), cultures and/or biopsy in cases of severe pancreatitis.

Treatment of Pancreatitis in Cats
Pancreatitis is treated with IV fluids, pain and anti-nausea medication, as well as treatment for the underlying cause if that can be determined. 

The earlier the disease is treated, the more likely it will resolve without further complications. In some cases, pancreatitis progresses to a more chronic disease or may have lasting complications such as diabetes, that will need to be managed.  

In severe cases of pancreatitis, or cases where complications such as feline triaditis, your veterinarian may suggest 24-hour care. However, if numerous blood clots form, a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (or DIC), a veterinarian may recommend euthanasia to spare the patient from suffering. 

Recovery and Management of Pancreatitis in Cats
When caught and treated early, cats that have suffered from pancreatitis can usually return home to live a happy and healthy life. Cats suffering from chronic pancreatitis may also go on to live a relatively normal life, with some lifestyle changes, that may include an alternative diet, frequent check-ups, and chronic medication.
Pancreatitis in Cats FAQsCan you treat pancreatitis in cats at home?Pancreatitis can be a progressive disease so it’s always best to have your cat examined first. If hospital treatment is not an option, the pet parent can work with the veterinarian to treat the cat at home as an out-patient. However, severe cases will require hospitalization.
What is the life expectancy for a cat with pancreatitis?Most cats that suffer from acute or chronic pancreatitis can go on to live a relatively normal life.
Can a cat recover from pancreatitis and when to euthanize a cat with pancreatitis?Most cats do recover from pancreatitis, fortunately. When progress is poor and the outcome is grave due to complications such as multi-organ failure and blood clotting (intravascular coagulation), euthanasia may be recommended.

204,Pancreatic Cancer in Cats,"Insulinoma in Cats



Insulinomas are malignant neoplasms — fast growing cancerous tissue — of the beta cells in the pancreas. The beta cells primarily make and secrete insulin, which has a variety of effects in the body, the primary one being to regulate glucose throughout the body's cells. Because insulinomas secrete excessive insulin, the blood stream becomes low in glucose (hypoglycemia), which causes weakness and/or neurological problems. This disease does not effect cats as much as it does some other household pets, but it can and does occur.



Symptoms



The most common symptom of an insulinoma is physical collapse or loss of consciousness (syncope). Seizures, extreme weakness, and other neurological abnormalities are also common. Because the insulin is released periodically, symptoms are not consistent and frequency of symptoms is not necessarily predictable.



Diagnosis



If your cat should collapse and a blood sample indicates low glucose, your veterinarian will suspect an insulinoma and will follow through with further tests to confirm it. Multiple blood samples may need to be taken over a period of time to determine a persistent low glucose concentration. Your veterinarian will also need to determine your cat's insulin concentration at the lowest glucose concentration. 



It is common to fast from food before these tests are performed in order to determine true glucose levels. However, cats that do not eat are at high risk for a disease called hepatic lipidosis, so if your cat has not been eating due to loss of appetite, your veterinarian will advise you on the correct method for feeding (or not feeding) your cat before each test. 



An amended insulin:glucose ratio (AIGR) may be useful when your cat's insulin level is in the lower end of the normal range. Insulinoma is still the expected finding in these types of cases. If the insulin level is inappropriately high for the decreased glucose level, an insulinoma may still be present.



Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in determining the extent of the pancreatic tumor and how much it is metastasizing. Typically, insulinomas will not metastasize to the lungs; however, chest X-rays may indicate other types of neoplasias as the cause for persistently decreased glucose. Scintigraphy, a form of imaging that uses radioactive isotopes to identify abnormal tissue, can also be used to identify the location of primary insulinomas and metastasis.





Treatment



If your cat has collapsed, or is suffering from seizures because of an insulinoma, medical emergency treatment usually will consist of an immediate administration of glucose. If you cat collapses or has a seizure at home, corn syrup can be given for a temporary increase in blood sugar levels, but medical attention is needed for this condition, so consulting with your veterinarian is critical. Your veterinarian may also give your cat glucose containing fluids and/or steroids to counteract the insulin effects.



If your cat's health status, along with imaging of the tumor, indicates that potential value can be gained from surgery, removal of the tumor is usually recommended. Hypoglycemia may be resolved by removing the part of the pancreas that has the tumor on it. However, if there is significant metastases or functional tumor cells in the remainder of the pancreas, additional treatment will still be necessary. Likewise, if the tumors are generalized, or there are other health concerns, medical management may be advised as the primary mode of treatment.



Prednisolone is a steroid that stimulates the formation of glucose and is often a cornerstone of medical treatment. Other medications that might be used to treat insulinoma include:


	Diazoxide
	Octreotide
	Glucagon
	Chemotherapeutic agents, like streptozocin




Dietary management is frequently used in conjunction with other treatments. In fact, you may be able to minimize the amount of medication or the need for additional treatments by feeding your cat small, frequent amounts of easily digestible moderate proteins, moderate fats, and plenty of fluids. Canned foods can meet many of these needs.



Clinically, the most important dietary technique is the frequency of the meals. Essentially, this technique is used to limit the fluctuations in insulin that instigate the hypoglycemic episodes. Controlling symptoms of hypoglycemia is ultimately the goal. Your veterinarian will assist you in developing a diet plan for your cat.



Living and Management



Surgery, along with dietary precautions, can dramatically lessen hypoglycemia and insulinoma symptoms for your cat. In many cases continued medical treatment and dietary management will be necessary. Frequent check-ups to determine the progress of this condition and the treatments being used for it will be necessary for managing a recurrence, and for fine tuning the treatment plan.","

205,Pancreatic Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma in Cats

Neoplasm, or tumor, can be either benign or malignant in nature. Carcinomas are malignant tumors found both in humans and animals. This type of tumor tends to be particularly malignant, often recurring after surgical excision. Adenocarcinomas originate in the glandular tissue and are glandular in structure. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a rare tumor in cats, and like other carcinomas it grows rapidly and metastasizes to distant parts and organs of the body. In most cats metastasis is found at the time of diagnosis, thus making treatment difficult for these patients. Similar to other neoplasms, adenocarcinoma of the pancreas usually affects older cats (more than eight years). It can occur in any breed or gender of cat.

Symptoms and Types

There are no specific tumor related symptoms. Following are some of the signs commonly seen in patients with adenocarcinoma of pancreas:


    Fever
    Weakness
    Jaundice
    Poor digestion
    Weight loss
    Abdominal pain


Causes

The exact cause is unknown, and is classified as idiopathic.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will recommend a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A determination of the lipase (an enzyme released by the pancreas) level will assist your veterinarian in the diagnosis, as it is often elevated in a majority of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Your veterinarian will also perform abdominal radiographs in order to determine the presence of any masses or changes in the pancreas tissue. Ultrasonography is also used to further improve diagnostic accuracy. If the above mentioned procedures fail to establish a definite diagnosis, your veterinarian may recommend a surgical biopsy of pancreatic tissue to confirm diagnosis.



Treatment

There is no curative remedy available for the treatment of this rare tumor. Surgery and medications are used in those cases in which treatment is suggested. A partial or total surgical removal of the pancreas may be performed. Pain control medication may be required to prevent severe pain associated with this tumor.

Living and Management

What you may do at home with your cat to improve the quality of its life is provide extra care and affection to ease its discomfort. For ongoing treatment you may need to visit your veterinary oncologist at regular intervals. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines, especially in giving the chemotherapeutic agents at home. Many chemotherapeutic agents can be hazardous to your health if not handled properly; consult with your veterinarian on the best handling practices."," and Types

206,Painful and Frequent Urination in Cats,"Dysuria and Pollakiuria in Cats

While the urinary bladder and urethra normally serve to store and release urine, there are  two disorders that affect the lower urinary tract by damaging the bladder wall or stimulating the nerve endings in the bladder or urethra. Dysuria is a condition that leads to painful urination, and pollakiuria refers to abnormally frequent urination. In other words, you'll have a cat that goes to the bathroom often; the cat may even have pain or show discomfort while urinating.

Symptoms


    Extreme irritability
    Discomfort or pain during urination
    Frequent ""accidents"" occuring outside the litter box


Causes

Dysuria and pollakiuria are generally caused by lesions, stones, cancer, or trauma to the urinary bladder and/or urethra. (Lesions and stones are good indicators of a lower urinary tract disease.)

Other factors include:

For the Urinary Bladder

    Anatomic abnormalities
    Malfunction of bladder muscles
    Chemicals/drugs
    Medical procedures


For the Urethra

    Anatomic abnormalities
    Kidney stones
    Urethral plugs
    Increased tension of the urethral 	sphincter (the muscle used to control urine flow)
    Medical procedures


For the Prostrate Gland

    Cancer
    Cysts
    Inflammation or abscess


  

Diagnosis

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. After establishing a thorough medical and behavioral history of your cat, your veterinarian will be able to rule out a variety of causes, using differential diagnosis methods, so that a diagnosis can be made. Dysuria and/or pollakiuria may have come about as the result of repercussions from surgical procedures or drug usage, and behavioral symptoms, such as spraying, or marking territory will give your veterinarian a better idea of the underlying cause. These conditions and symptoms will be either confirmed or ruled out until your your veterinarian is able to settle on the most obvious cause of the illness.

Treatment

Cats with less serious, nonobstructive lower urinary tract diseases are typically seen on an outpatient basis, while others require hospitalization.

Treatment mainly depends on the fundamental cause of the condition(s). If an illness has led to dysuria and/or pollakiuria, it will include supportive therapies, along with any medication needed to help with the symptoms. Nevertheless, these conditions often clear up rapidly after proper treatment has been prescribed and given.","

207,Pain from the Nervous System in Cats,"Neuropathic Pain in Cats

 

An injury or disease relating to the body’s nerves and how they function, or within the spinal cord itself is commonly the origin of neuropathic pain. This particular kind of pain is difficult to pinpoint, especially in patients that are unable to respond to specific inducements. A common condition seen in cats is diabetes, and a tingling and pain in the hind legs is one form of neuropathic pain.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Damage to the tissues of the body, and the nerves running through them, creates a constant (chronic) pain that is brought on by a light touch to the affected area and/or a heightened perception of pain. Pain originating within the spinal cord causes problems with mobility and various functions of the body.

 

Some of the symptoms of neuropathic pain may include:




	Limping or dragging a limb
	Shaking or twitching of the skin
	Chewing on the affected area
	Muscle wasting (atrophy)
	Crying out (vocalizing)
	Decreased appetite
	Urinating and defecating inappropriately (incontinence)


 

Causes

 

Neuropathic pain may result from an injury to body tissues or a growth (tumor) in the spinal cord. Diseases that affect the spinal cord, such as intervertebral disc disease (IVDD), may cause pain in different areas of the body, depending on which part of the cord is affected. Another potential cause of neuropathic pain is amputation of a limb. Phantom limb pain results in the impression of pain coming from a leg that has been surgically removed.

 

In cats, a common cause of neuropathic pain is diabetes mellitus. The result is a weakness in the hind legs which comes from damage to the nerves caused by constant high levels of sugar in the blood. Pain may accompany the weakness, with tingling and numbness in the limbs.

 

Diagnosis

 

In general, neuropathic pain is diagnosed by ruling out other causes of pain and performing reflex tests to evaluate the nervous system. Basic blood tests can help rule out infectious and disease-related causes. Blood glucose tests will help to determine if your cat is diabetic, if the cat has not already been previously diagnosed. X-rays and special imaging may be necessary to search for tumors in the bone or spinal cord. Finally, a good discussion of your cat's medical and behavioral history, and the symptoms that led up this condition will help lead to the proper diagnosis.

 



Treatment

 

Analgesic medications (those that relieve pain) are used as the initial treatment for neuropathic pain. The amount given may need to be changed until the best effect is achieved. Other types of pain relievers may be tried until the one that works best for your cat is found. Some veterinarians may choose to use several pain medications at one time and then taper off until only one is being given.



One medication that is has been used with success for long-term pain is gabapentin. This anti-seizure drug has analgesic properties that are particularly effective for reducing neuropathic pain in cats. Gabapentin is given once daily for pain control and can be given with or without food. The particular side effects of this drug include sedation, weight gain, and stumbling (ataxia). Diarrhea may also be seen in some animals.



Dosages of gabapentin may be too small for cats. If this is the case, your veterinarian may need to have the drug specially made at a compounding pharmacy. 



Living and Management

 

If your cat is in chronic pain it may gain considerable relief from analgesic medications. The quality of life for these animals can be much improved, as long as the underlying condition causing the pain is under control.

 

In cats with kidney problems, the dosage of gabapentin may be reduced, as the drug is processed through the kidneys and they must be functioning properly for the drug to be removed from the body. Animals that are pregnant should not be treated with gabapentin. When discontinuing the medication, gabapentin should be slowly tapered off to prevent seizures from occurring after long-term use."," and Types

208,"Pain (Acute, Chronic and Postoperative) in Cats","Sharp/Sudden Pain, Long Term Pain or Pain Following a Surgical Procedure in Cats

One of the biggest challenges in animal care is determining the source of your cat's pain. This is partly due to their limited ability to convey the pain. Cats vary greatly in their specific responses to pain, and the animal's age, species, experience, and current environment will also affect their response levels. There are numerous causes of pain; most are commonly associated with tissue damage. Treatment options are available that can help to reduce the amount of pain that your cat is experiencing.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types

The most common sign that a cat is in pain will be a vocal cue or a sign of significant agitation. Some cats will become extremely sensitive to touch and stimuli that would normally not cause them any discomfort. Cats that are experiencing long-term pain may exhibit signs of depression, reduction in appetite, trembling, and even biting/snapping when someone reaches out to pet them. Cats that are experiencing a sudden, sharp pain may experience rapid, shallow breathing, a rise in blood pressure and an increased heart rate.

Causes

Pain can be caused by a variety of conditions, including injury, degenerative issues in the animal's tissues, blunt trauma, or following surgery or medical treatment.

Diagnosis

Since pain is challenging to diagnose, veterinarians will often complete a full physical examination to rule out biological causes for the pain.



Treatment

There are a variety of medications that can be used to assist animals in managing their pain and responses to pain. If it has been determined that there is an underlying cause of the pain, it will be treated simultaneously. In some cases surgery is used to reduce the pain source. While the cat is recovering, limited movement and physical activity is recommended.

Living and Management

Padded bedding and a comfortable environment can help to reduce the cat's pain. Some bandaging may be used to reduce pressure and swelling, ultimately reducing pain for the cat as well. If the animal's weight is causing joint pain, a weight reduction diet may be recommended.

Each cat will react differently to the type and dosage level of the prescribed pain medication. Monitor your pet's response to the medication and talk with your veterinarian if you believe your animal is having a negative reaction or is still experiencing a high amount of pain. If the pain is severe and treatment is not helping, many owners choose to put their cats to sleep (euthanise).

Prevention

If you know that your animal has been injured, it can be helpful to seek out a pain management treatment quickly. This can help reduce the pain."," and Types

Cats that are experiencing a sudden, sharp pain may experience rapid, shallow breathing, a rise in blood pressure and an increased heart rate.

209,Overproduction of White Blood Cells in the Bone Marrow in Cats,"Hypereosinophilic Syndrome in Cats
 


Hypereosinophilic syndrome, characterized by persistent eosinophilia -- that is, sustained overproduction of eosinophils (white blood cells of the immune system) in the bone marrow, is a disorder of unknown cause. However, its suspected cause is a link to a severe reaction to an unidentified antigen, or impairment of the immune response and control of eosinophil production. This is a multi-system syndrome, with invasion of the tissues by eosinophils and subsequent organ damage and dysfunction.
 
Organ damage can result from the effects of eosinophil granule products and eosinophil-derived cytokines, a category of regulatory proteins that are released by cells in the immune system into the tissues. Common sites of infiltration include the gastrointestinal tract (especially the intestine and liver), spleen, bone marrow, lungs, and lymph nodes (especially those in the abdominal area). It frequently has a fatal outcome.
 
Less common sites of infiltration include the skin, kidney, heart, thyroid, adrenal glands and pancreas. Middle-aged domestic short hair cats appear to be predisposed, and female cats are diagnosed more frequently than males.
 
Symptoms
 

    Lethargy
    Fever
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Intermittent vomiting and diarrhea
    Weight loss
    Emaciation
    Enlargement of the liver and spleen
    Thickened (diffuse or segmental) intestine that is non-painful
    Abdominal masses
    Itching and seizures (less frequently)
    Mesenteric and possibly peripheral lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes in the abdominal region or other areas of the body)
    Mass lesions caused by eosinophilic granulomatous (inflamed masses of tissue) involving the lymph nodes and/or organs

 
Causes

The cause of hypereosinophilic syndrome is unknown. However, it is believed to be cause by a severe reaction to an underlying, as yet unidentifiable antigenic stimulus that may be composed of two different strains of a virus. An early form of this disorder may be apparent in some cats; eosinophilic enteritis, an inflammatory disease of the small intestine that is directly related to infiltration of eosinophils in the connective tissue of the intestinal lining. 
 
Diagnosis
 
The veterinary examination will consist of standard laboratory work, including a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Additional diagnostics will include a bone marrow aspiration and/or core biopsy of the cells, and a biopsy of the affected organ or mass. It is typical for the blood test results to show increased amounts of multiple types of white blood cells, most notably leukocytosis (leukocyte), basophilia (basophil), and eosinophilia (eosinophil). The results of the blood tests may also show anemic conditions, and the biochemical profile may show abnormalities in the case of organ dysfunction.
 
Diagnostic imaging can be helpful in determining the extent of organ damage as well. Radiographic contrast, which uses an injection of a radiocontrasting agent into the area to be viewed, may be used to improve visibility of the internal organs. These X-rays may show thickened intestines and abnormalities in the lining of the intestines. Other findings may be reactive hyperplasia (abnormal enlargement) of the lymph nodes due to eosinophil infiltration, and fibrosis (excess fibrous connective tissue) and thrombosis (coagulation in the arteries) surrounding the heart.
 
Treatment
 
Long-term maintenance therapy will be employed to control or reduce the eosinophilia and organ damage. High serum immunoglobulin concentrations (the fraction of the blood serum that contains antibodies) can signify a good response to treatment with prednisone, a corticosteroid given to reduce inflammation, and therefore a better prognosis. Prednisone can be effective at suppressing eosinophil production. In some cases, chemotherapy may be appropriate for inhibiting DNA synthesis, in effect, reducing the reproduction of cells. Massive tissue infiltration can impede treatment and usually leads to a poor prognosis.
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up examinations for your cat to monitor eosinophil counts (not always indicative of tissue infiltrates) and myelosuppression (by which bone marrow activity is decreased) if chemotherapeutic drugs are being used. Clinical signs will also be monitored along with any physical abnormalities (e.g. loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea).","

210,Ovarian Tumors in Cats,"Ovarian Cysts in Cats

There are three kinds cat ovarian tumors: epithelial tumors (skin/tissue), germ cell tumors (sperm and ova), and stromal tumors (connective tissue). The most common type of ovarian tumor in in cats is sex-cord (granulosa-theca cell) ovarian tumors. Granulosa cells are follicular cells (hollow cells) surrounded by theca cells (which form a surrounding sheath). Ovarian tumors are prone to metastasizing (spreading), and some are capable of producing hormones.

The tumors described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

        Bilateral, 	symmetrical baldness
        Masculinization 	(excess testosterone)
    
    


Causes

This condition is often associated with non-spayed and non-neutered cats.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. You will need to give your doctor a thorough history of your cat's health, with a description of the onset of symptoms. X-rays may reveal the spread of cancerous cells (metastases) by way of the blood vessels or lymphatic system.

Your veterinarian will also take X-rays and ultrasound images of the abdomen and chest to look for further evidence of tumors. Abdominal X-rays might show a unilateral or bilateral mid-abdominal mass near the kidney, or fluid build-up in the abdominal cavity. An ultrasound of the abdomen can reveal similar information, but with even greater sensitivity and detail. If there is excess fluid in the pleural (chest) lining, or fluid in the abdomen, your veterinarian will take a fluid sample for microscopic (cytologic) examination.



If the size of the tumor is minor, and the growth minimal, your veterinarian may recommend surgery to remove a solitary tumor, or to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the tumor. Even if a tumor appears to be obviously malignant, and is metastasizing (growing), a biopsy can still be invaluable for the final, definitive diagnosis.

Your veterinarian may also want to perform a procedure called a histopathologic examination, for tracking changes in the tissue, to better understand the character of the growth.

Treatment

A single tumor can be removed surgically, and will generally not require a long stay in the veterinary hospital. Although benign tumors are rare, there are cases where this is so, and cats that have this type of tumor will easily recover. This is also generally true in cases where a malignant tumor has been located and treated before it has the opportunity to spread.

A malignant tumor that has spread can be treated with chemotherapy, and its growth may be halted, put into remission, and sometimes cured all together. The prognosis for this condition is guarded. Cancerous tumors are notoriously independent, and treatment is not always effective.

Living and Management

Schedule follow-up appointments every three months so that your veterinarian can check for new or continued growth (mestasis)."," and Types

211,Out-of-place Urethral Lining in Cats,"Urethral Prolapse in Cats

An out-of-place urethral mucosal lining (the mucus-producing lining of the urethral canal that carries urine out of the bladder) is commonly referred to as urethral prolapse. This condition causes mucosal lining to move to the outer portion of the urethra, vaginal, or penile opening, making it visible.

Urethral prolapse can affect several other parts of a cat's body, including the urinary bladder (the storage sac for urine), the urinary tract, reproductive organs, and the immune system.

In many instances, no specific treatment is required unless there is a more serious underlying medical condition, or in the event of an infection.

Urethral prolapse can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

A prolapsed urethra often looks similar to a pea-sized mass, and may be red or purple in color. This can often be observed as a small mass of tissue on the end of the penis (or in a female, protruding from the urethral tract).

If the cat excessively licks the mass, it can become enlarged or inflamed. In some cases, the protrusion can bleed on or around the urethral opening. Cats with urethral prolapse usually have difficulties urinating.

Causes

Sexual excitement may cause the mass to develop, as does inner abdominal pressure. Other possible causes include:


    Testicular disease
    Urethral diseases
    Fractures of the penis
    Abnormal anatomical development
    Irritation due to sexual activity


Diagnosis

X-rays and other types of diagnostic imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized axial tomography scans (CAT) are often used to rule out any underlying issues with the prostate or bladder. Upon examination, your veterinarian will also need to rule out other common underlying causes, including fractures of the penis and urethral and testicular diseases.

Because some issues are only present during ejaculation, your veterinarian may find this action helpful for examining the body's genital functioning.


Treatment

If there is inflammation or risk for infection, antibiotics are often prescribed prophylactically (preventively). In cases of extensive bleeding or pain, surgery will generally be recommended, but in many instances there is no need for treatment. Slowing your cat's physical activity to allow time for rest and healing is generally all that is required for the condition to pass.

Living and Management

The risk of recurrence is fairly high, so it is important that you observe any physical changes to the cat's genital area.

Prevention

Unfortunately, there are no preventive measures for urethral prolapse. If a cat shows a high likelihood of recurrence, neutering the animal may be your best option."," and Types

212,Osteosarcoma In Cats,"What Is Osteosarcoma in Cats?
Osteosarcoma (OSA) is an aggressive or malignant bone cancer that affects any part of the skeleton. In cats, appendicular OSA may affect the limbs, pelvis, shoulders, or paws. It is much more common than axial OSA, which may target the head, neck, or spine. Appendicular OSA affects the pelvis more often than the forelimbs, and the jaw is the most common bone affected by axial OSA.

Often arising from the bone itself, the cancer starts to eat away at the bone, causing pain, inflammation, and eventually a fracture. Over time, the cancer may spread to the lymph nodes, chest, spleen, and other areas of the body.

Bone cancer is not as aggressive in cats as it is in dogs, and it and metastasizes only 5-10% of the time. OSA affects male and female cats of any age, and even though this type of cancer is rare, older cats are more apt to get it.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Osteosarcoma in Cats
One of the first signs of OSA in cats may be a change in behavior or the development of lameness.  Bone cancer in cats is extremely painful. Your cat may stop eating and may be withdrawn, more irritable, and aggressive. 

The symptoms of OSA are often related to where the tumor originated. For example, if your cat’s tumor affects one of their limbs, you may notice lameness, swelling, and pain to the touch at the site as well as a reluctance to walk, run, or jump.

If the tumor affects the cat’s jaw, then you may notice your cat having difficulty eating, swallowing, or opening and closing the mouth, and they may lose weight as a result.

As the bone cancer progresses, fractures can occur. You may notice an acute start of lameness, disuse of the limb, misalignment of the jaw, and a refusal to walk altogether. If you notice any signs of a broken bone, your cat should be examined by your veterinarian immediately.

Causes of Osteosarcoma in Cats
Cancer occurs often and for reasons that are not well understood. Multiple factors such as age, UV damage or other environmental triggers, DNA mutations, and genetics have been associated with certain cancers. Rarely is there a single cause for cancer; the development of bone cancer is no different.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Osteosarcoma in Cats
To diagnose bone cancer in your cat, your veterinarian will perform the following:


	
	Physical exam to find the affected location 
	
	
	X-ray of affected area
	
	
	Chest CT scan and abdominal ultrasound to look for metastasis 
	
	
	Cytology (fine-needle aspiration of mass)
	
	
	Biopsy (large needle is inserted into the lesion to obtain a core of bone) 
	


Once diagnosed, your veterinarian will determine how far the bone cancer has spread, which can include a cytology of the lymph nodes, abdominal ultrasound, and chest x-rays, if not already taken.

There are other more advanced diagnostics, such as CT or nuclear scintigraphy, that might be needed and that are usually done at a referral facility. 

Treatment of Osteosarcoma in Cats
First, pain should be appropriately managed in all cases of feline OSA. Your veterinarian will often prescribe pain medications such as buprenorphine, gabapentin, amantadine, or NSAIDs such as robenacoxib or meloxicam. 

Another form of controlling pain is amputation of the affected limb. Amputation alone may also cure those cats affected by appendicular OSA. For cats with axial OSA, mandibulectomy or maxillectomy (removal of part of the jaw) surgery is most often performed. 

Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are all treatment options for bone cancer in cats. Radiation, though uncommon, may help improve patient comfort and decrease inflammation. Chemotherapy is used if surgery is not an option. 

Regardless of treatment type, most cats have an average survival rate of 12 months for appendicular OSA and six months for axial OSA. However, for cats that have had an amputation, the average survival rate was about four years. 

Cats with evidence of metastasis or cancer of the humerus (forelimb bone) often have a poorer prognosis. Consultation with a veterinary oncologist to discuss your cat’s treatment and prognosis is recommended.

Recovery and Management of Osteosarcoma in Cats
Adequate pain control is important throughout your cat’s treatment. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines and recommendations and adhere to follow-up appointments. 

Cats undergoing radiation or chemotherapy may need special care, such as their pet parents learning how to deal with their waste or administering long-term medications. Follow-up appointments and future screenings are vital to check for signs of cancer recurrence. 

For cats that have had an amputation, your vet will prescribe four weeks of cage rest for recovery. Keep in mind that cats often do remarkably well on three legs and rarely are hampered by their missing limb. Don’t neglect to consider amputation as a viable solution. 
Osteosarcoma in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with bone cancer? Bone cancer prognosis in cats varies, and highly depends on the severity of disease and therapy used.
Is bone cancer painful in cats? Extremely. Given the painful nature of the disease, medication is part of every cat’s treatment plan, and in the majority of cases, amputation of a limb is recommended as a way to eliminate the pain.
How common is osteosarcoma in cats?Fortunately, osteosarcoma in cats is not a common type of cancer, as bone tumors only account for about 0.05% of cases. However, of those cases, 70-80% of them are osteosarcoma.

213,Osteomyelitis in Cats,"What Is Osteomyelitis in Cats?
Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of bone tissue anywhere in the body, including legs, spine, and mouth (dental abscess). The inflammation may occur without infection, and this is called sterile osteomyelitis. However, in cats, infectious causes are more common.

When bone becomes inflamed, bone tissue responds by creating new bone and destroying existing bone. This causes pain, which can in turn cause limping (leg), neck or back discomfort (spinal bones), or decreased or no appetite (tooth socket). Varying degrees of swelling may also be noted over the affected area.

If a cat is acting sick—lethargic, running a fever, not eating or drinking, or not able to walk—seek emergency care ASAP. If your cat is limping but otherwise acting normally, seek care with your regular veterinarian.

Types of Osteomyelitis in Cats


	
	Bacterial: Bacteria is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in cats. It can spread to bone through the blood (hematogenous spread) or gain access via open wounds.

	
		
		Acute: The onset of lameness, pain, fever, and lethargy seems sudden.
		
		
		Chronic: The cat has a longer history of limping/pain but is otherwise acting normally. 
		
	
	



	
	Fungal: Fungal organisms are inhaled into the lungs and get into the blood and lymphatic system, which then leads to bone infection. The prevalence of these organisms is geographical, so your veterinarian may inquire about any travel history with your cat. Veterinarians who work in fungal-endemic areas see fungal causes of osteomyelitis more often.
	
	
	Sterile: Osteomyelitis without bacteria; this is rare in cats.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Osteomyelitis in Cats
Early in the infection, a cat with osteomyelitis may be:


	
	Limping or not wanting to walk
	
	
	Showing painful swelling over the affected area
	
	
	Not wanting to eat
	
	
	Lethargic
	
	
	Running a fever
	


A cat with a more chronic bone infection may no longer have a fever or be lethargic. However, the cat will likely still be limping or not walking normally, and will have muscle-wasting due to not using the sore part of the body appropriately. There also may be open draining wounds over the sites of swelling, both early on and later in infection.

Causes of Osteomyelitis in Cats
Bacterial

Although bacteria can gain access to bone via the bloodstream, this route is more common in kittens and immune-compromised cats. A healthy adult cat is more likely to get a bone infection through a bite or other penetrating trauma (such as a stick or wire). Open fractures, where there is a broken bone with exposure through damaged skin and soft tissues, may also lead to bacterial infection and subsequent osteomyelitis.

In addition, bacteria can gain access to bone during bone surgery if sterility is not maintained. Bacteria that enter the surgical site or that are on the implants at the surgery site can lead to infection.

Oral Cavity

One of the most common forms of osteomyelitis is in the oral cavity. Dental disease and dental abscesses are a form of osteomyelitis. Just like humans, cats can develop gum inflammation, tartar accumulation, and tooth abscesses. Bone in the jaw reacts to the oral inflammation, causing pain. This can affect a cat’s ability to eat, and the cat may drool, drop food, or have bad breath.

Fungal

Some fungal organisms can cause osteomyelitis in cats. However, unlike bacteria, which is widespread, the three major fungal causes of osteomyelitis are only found in certain geographical regions. In the United States:


	
	Coccidioides is endemic (found) in the Southwest.
	
	
	Blastomyces and Histoplasma are most prevalent in the river valley region of the Midwest, especially along the Mississippi River.
	
	
	Cryptococcus is a fourth fungal cause that can be found in many geographical regions.
	


Fungal organisms gain entrance to the body primarily by inhalation and spread to tissues of the body (including bone) via the blood and lymphatic system.

How Vets Diagnose Osteomyelitis in Cats
If your cat has a fever, lethargy, and lameness, a baseline lab-work panel is usually performed. A cat with sudden onset osteomyelitis will likely have an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. If a cat has a more chronic or longstanding illness, the WBC count may be normal. Depending on the degree of bone inflammation present, blood calcium and phosphorus levels may be elevated.

X-rays of the affected areas will be taken to look for evidence of soft tissue and bony changes. In the early stage of inflammation, bony changes may not yet be noted; however, soft tissue swelling can be seen. As more time passes from the onset of clinical signs, changes in bone will be noted on subsequent x-rays. There will be both bone destruction and new bone formation.

Your vet may recommend x-rays two weeks after the initial set to look for changes in bone that may not have been initially present.

Usually, a diagnosis of osteomyelitis can be made based on a combination of history, physical exam, lab work, and/or radiographic findings. However, additional diagnostics may be recommended:


	
	Advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be pursued if x-rays are not providing a clear answer.
	
	
	Fungal blood titers (antibody levels) may be recommended if you live in an endemic area or if your cat has a history of recent travel to an endemic area of the US.
	
	
	Bone biopsy is a surgical procedure performed to determine the cause of osteomyelitis (bacterial vs. fungal) and to make a definitive diagnosis of osteomyelitis (as bone cancer can look similar on x-rays to fungal osteomyelitis). During this procedure, samples of abnormal bone tissue are taken and submitted to determine if the bone is inflamed or if it is bone cancer. 
	


Treatment of Osteomyelitis in Cats
Bacterial osteomyelitis is treated with antibiotics, which are best selected by obtaining culture samples from the affected bone. Samples may be obtained via needle aspirate of the site or during surgical cleaning of the area. The type of bacteria present can be identified, and a panel of antibiotics tested to determine which option is best. For acute infections, antibiotic therapy may last 4-6 weeks, and for chronic infections, 6-8 weeks to several months.

Fungal osteomyelitis is treated with antifungal medications. Anti-inflammatory and other pain medications are likely to also be used.

Surgical intervention is needed with the presence of dead bone, debris, or implants (screws, plate, teeth, etc.). All these materials serve as a focus) for infection, and until they are removed, the infection will persist.

A complication of osteomyelitis is pathological fracture of the affected bone, which occurs when a diseased bone breaks because of damage and weakening due to infection. This is a difficult situation, because the bone cannot simply be repaired. Diseased bone is usually too weak to hold implants, and surgical failure is not uncommon. Ultimately, the treatment plan chosen will depend on the patient and the situation.

Recovery and Management of Osteomyelitis in Cats
A cat being treated for osteomyelitis will be monitored long-term for side effects of medications and response to treatment. Initially, rechecks will be more frequent. After surgery your cat may be kept in the hospital for a few days to a week or so, for wound care and monitoring.

Response to treatment is likely to be followed via x-ray imaging. Lab work may need to be rechecked with long-term use of antifungal medications.

Cats may be susceptible to recurrent episodes of osteomyelitis, especially fungal osteomyelitis. Bacterial osteomyelitis may also recur, especially if resistance to antibiotics becomes a problem.

Pet parents play an important role in treatment outcomes. They need to follow up with all recommended recheck appointments. Also, all medications must be given as directed by the care team. If in doubt, contact your veterinarian for guidance.

Prevention of Osteomyelitis in Cats

Since most cases of osteomyelitis in cats are bacterial, with bacteria most commonly gaining access to bone through open wounds, keeping cats indoors is the best way to protect them. If kept indoors, your cat will be less likely to suffer fractured bones, penetrating injuries, or cat bite or fight wounds.

Routine dental care is also helpful in prevention of dental disease. This includes at-home care (brushing, oral rinses) and complete dental cleanings with your veterinarian.

214,Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats,"What Is Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats?
Osteochondrodysplasia, or Scottish Fold disease (SFOCD), is a genetic mutation found in the Scottish Fold breed of cat. This mutation affects cartilage development and causes the breed’s classic appearance of having forward-folded ears.

The gene, termed the Fd gene, is autosomal dominant, which means only one copy of the gene is needed to cause disease. When cats carry two copies of the gene, the genetic defect leads to abnormalities in the bones during the growth phase, which causes severe lameness, pain, and progressive arthritis.

It also affects the kitten’s normal playful behaviors of jumping and playing, leading to a poor quality of life. These cats also develop symptoms much sooner and at an earlier age, whereas cats with only one copy of the gene will develop arthritis at a slower rate.

As there is no cure, SFOCD in cats is not considered a medical emergency. However, as the symptoms can be quite disabling and painful, seek veterinary care for your cat if you suspect they have the disease.

Symptoms of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats
Symptoms are related to the amount of bone damage, and some cats may not have any symptoms or minor ones. However, the majority of affected cats will show the following, all of which can worsen with time:


	
	Reluctance to move or jump
	
	
	Vocalization during exercise
	
	
	Abnormal posture or walk
	
	
	Lameness, often appearing worse in the hindlimbs
	
	
	Skeletal deformities: misshaped bones and joints; shortened and thicker tail; thickened feet, often with the toes spread wide
	
	
	Decreased joint flexibility and fused bones/joints (ankylosis)
	
	
	Reclusive behavior
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Poor grooming behavior
	
	
	Accidents outside of the litter box
	
	
	Decreased energy
	


Causes of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats
Osteochondrodysplasia is an inherited condition, meaning one or both parents have a gene that causes the condition.

It's only seen in Scottish Fold cats—hence the name Scottish Fold disease—as the breed characteristic of having folded ears is due to the same gene mutation that causes this disease.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats 
As an inherited disease, symptoms arise soon after birth in the Scottish Fold cat. Identification of the patient, often including age, gender, and breed, along with physical exam findings are signs that the veterinarian is dealing with a cat affected by osteochondrodysplasia.

X-rays, however, are used to diagnose the condition, looking for the various bone anomalies noted above as well as signs of arthritis.

Treatment of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats
Unfortunately, there is no cure for Scottish Fold disease in cats. A combination of pain medications such as gabapentin; NSAIDs such as Onsior® or meloxicam; or a newer medication, Solensia™, a monoclonal antibody that targets nerve growth factor (an important factor in pain and swelling), can work to limit pain and minimize the progression of symptoms. Radiation therapy, which helps to alleviate pain, may also be an option.

Long-term therapies are often unrealistic, however, as the side effects of these medications can be severe, and symptoms can stop responding to medical management over time. At this point, humane euthanasia may be chosen.

While getting therapy, it’s important to keep your cat comfortable and manage their pain properly. Of course, this means a good partnership with your vet, sticking to proper recheck recommendations, and following through with blood work and other testing as needed.

Depending on the circumstances, there can be certain at-home measures you can take to help keep your cat comfortable, such as:


	
	Providing multiple sources of comfortable bedding material
	
	
	Placing food and water bowls in an accessible area on the floor
	
	
	Using a large, walk-in type of litter box
	
	
	Blocking off access to stairs or pools
	
	
	Keeping the floor free from clutter
	
	
	Keeping your cat indoors
	
	
	Applying padding to sharp edges and corners

Recovery and Management of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats
Even though there is no true cure for SFOCD, the condition can be managed. In addition to prescription medications, over-the-counter products—such as joint supplements and chondroprotective agents to help reduce pain, minimize cartilage damage and swelling, increase joint lubrication, and help with cartilage production—can be recommended. A few of the many products available are Dasuquin®, Glycoflex®, or Cosequin®.

Also, diets with higher amounts of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, omega-3 and -6 fatty acids, and MSM could help. Talk with your vet about the best supplements and diet recommendations for your cat based on his unique medical and nutritional needs.

Finally, it’s important to follow your vet’s follow-up guidelines and continue all medications and diet as recommended. Many will be needed for the rest of your cat’s life.

Prevention of Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats
This condition can be prevented if ethical breeding standards are upheld. Cats with the condition and those who are carriers should not be used for breeding because of the potential for passing it on to their kittens.

However, once inherited, there is nothing you as a pet parent can do to prevent your cat from developing symptoms.

It’s important to seek treatment right away if something is wrong, so steps can be taken to minimize pain and slow the progression of the disease. Additionally, telling the veterinary staff of your cat’s ongoing condition is important so that any medications or future treatments can be given or performed as safely as possible.
Osteochondrodysplasia in Cats FAQsDo all Scottish Fold cats have osteochondrodysplasia? To an extent, yes; some Scottish Fold cats, however, will only develop minor symptoms while others can be affected so severely that their quality of life gets worse.
Is there a test for osteochondrodysplasia in cats?Unfortunately, there is not a straightforward way to test for this condition, but with recent advances in genomic technology, it's possible that there will be a test for this condition in the near future.

215,Oral Masses in Cats,"What Are Oral Masses in Cats?
An oral mass is any abnormal growth or swelling in the mouth or surrounding tissues. This includes the gums, tongue, oropharynx (part of the throat at the back of the mouth), larynx (area of the throat containing the vocal cords), glottis (the primary valve between the lungs and the mouth), epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing), hard and soft palates (the roof of the mouth), cheeks, lips, tonsils, and the glands, lymph nodes, and bones of the mouth.

An oral mass in a cat does not always mean cancer. The mass may be caused by infection, inflammation, an immune system disorder, trauma, or the formation of abnormally dividing cells (neoplasia). However, if left untreated, even a benign oral mass in a cat can become fatal.

Early detection and diagnosis of oral masses is key in reducing the morbidity and mortality of  feline patients. It’s important that you take your cat to their veterinarian yearly, so they can do a thorough examination of your cat’s mouth to identify any diseases and start treatment early in the disease process. Regular dental hygiene at home and annual dental cleanings can also lead to early diagnosis of an oral mass.

Types of Oral Masses in Cats

There are many different types of oral masses in cats. Some of the most common include:


	
	Tumor: A tumor is a mass of tissue generated by abnormally dividing cells that no longer respond to normal tissue-organizing stimuli. Tumors may be benign (noncancerous, slow-growing and do not spread) or malignant (cancerous, fast-growing and usually spread to lymph nodes and/or organs). Neoplasia occurs frequently in cats, with most tumors being cancerous. Benign tumors are very rare, but like malignant tumors, they can be very infiltrating and destroy the surrounding tissues.
	
	
	Non-neoplastic growths/swellings: There are a few immune system disorders and many inflammatory, infectious, and traumatic processes that result in secondary soft tissue and bony oral masses in cats.
	


Malignant Oral Tumors (Cancer)


	
	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common oral cancer in cats. SCC commonly occurs on the tongue, pharynx, or lower and upper jawbone.
	
	
	Fibrosarcoma (FSA) is the second most common oral cancer in cats. These cancers tend to be locally invasive to the gums and bones of the mouth.
	
	
	Other less common feline oral cancers include lymphosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and melanoma.
	


Benign Oral Tumors (Noncancer)


	
	Osteoma is a very rare benign tumor of the bone, usually involving the mandible in cats.  
	
	
	Odontogenic tumors are also rare and originate from the structure of and around teeth.

Symptoms of Oral Masses in Cats
In addition to the obvious (or not-so-obvious) mass, there are many other symptoms you might notice when your cat has an oral mass. Some of these include:


	
	Excessive salivation
	
	
	Blood in the mouth or blood-tinged saliva
	
	
	Decreased or loss of appetite
	
	
	Difficulty eating or apprehending food

	Abnormal tongue movements
	
	
	Loose teeth 
	
	
	Loud breathing
	
	
	Gagging
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Weight loss
	


Causes of Oral Masses in Cats
Depending on the type of oral mass, the cause may vary. The exact cause of feline oral cancer is unknown. However, like humans with cancer, feline oral cancers are typically caused by a combination of genetic and environmental influences. There are risk factors that are thought to significantly increase the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma, such as flea collars, high canned-food consumption (including tuna), and secondhand cigarette smoke. Excessive exposure to sunlight can also contribute to the development of skin squamous cell carcinomas on and around the outside of the mouth.

Periodontal disease, an infection and inflammation of the gums and supporting structures surrounding the teeth, is the most common disease in small animals. If left untreated it can result in many types of oral masses in cats. Trauma to the head and mouth can cause swellings in and around the mouth as well.

A few immune system disorders can also cause oral masses. Stomatitis is inflammation in the mouth and is thought to be determined by multiple factors. It is associated with viral, bacterial, and immune-mediated causes. Another disease, eosinophilic granuloma complex (EGC), includes skin lesions on the lips and/or in the mouth, and is thought to be associated with allergies. Lastly, allergic reactions can cause swellings of the mouth as well.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Oral Masses in Cats
A vet may perform diagnostic tests to determine the type of mass in a cat’s mouth, all of which require general anesthesia. Some of these tests include biopsy, a fine needle aspiration (FNA), dental or skull radiographs (x-rays), periodontal probing, MRI, and CT scans. Bloodwork done prior to these tests may also be helpful in a diagnosis. 

Treatment of Oral Masses in Cats
Early radical surgical resection (removal of the entire tumor as well as some healthy tissue around it, called the margin) is the treatment of choice for oral tumors, both benign and malignant,  in cats.

The surgical procedures used for cancers, osteomyelitis, and mandibular fractures for which primary repair is not possible or has failed are called mandibulectomy and maxillectomy.  These procedures remove the lower or upper jaw, respectively.

Some surgeries may not be curative alone, and the cat may require adjunct treatment such as chemotherapy and/or radiation. Cats that have an oral mass that has destroyed too much of the surrounding tissue (locally invasive) or encompasses multiple structures of the mouth and/or has spread to other areas (metastasized), or that have other comorbidities making anesthesia too challenging, would not be a good candidate for surgery.

Oral masses due to periodontal disease will need to be treated with antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, dental cleanings with or without teeth extractions, and sometimes full-mouth teeth extractions. Masses due to trauma will require surgery, medications, and manual reductions of the luxation. Treatment for immune system disorders may require steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, full-mouth extractions, and antihistamines.

Recovery and Management of Oral Masses in Cats
Prognosis depends heavily on the type of oral mass and treatment options available. 

Prevention of Oral Masses in Cats

Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent oral cancers in cats. It’s important to get routine annual exams and annual sedated dental cleanings to catch oral cancers early in the disease process. Annual dental cleanings with dental radiographs also support good oral health, which is very important, since it can help prevent many types of oral masses associated with periodontal disease and its secondary inflammatory processes. Taking this into account and incorporating good dental hygiene practices at home will allow for better treatment options and a better prognosis for your cat.

216,Optic Nerve Swelling in Cats,"Optic Neuritis in Cats

Optic neuritis is a condition in which one or both of the cat's optic nerves are swollen, resulting in impaired visual function. The optic nerve, sometimes called the cranial nerve, is a nerve in the eye that takes visual information and transmits it to the brain. Optic neuritis affects the ophthalmic and nervous systems of the body.

The primary form of optic neuritis is uncommon; the secondary form, however, is more common and occurs secondary to another disease, such as those affecting the central nervous system.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.
 
Symptoms and Types

Optic neuritis may be a primary disease or a secondary disease, meaning it occurs due to the presence of another disease in the body, such as a central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Optic neuritis is secondary to systematic CNS disease because the optic nerve communicates with the outermost layers of the brain (subarachnoid space).

Symptoms of optic neuritis include acute (sudden) onset of blindness and partial deficiencies in vision. A physical examination can reveal blindness or reduced vision in one or both eyes, fixed and dilated pupils, and a diminished light reflex of pupils. An examination of the anterior surface of the eye cavity may reveal a swollen optic disk, or a focal hemorrhage.

Causes
 
As previously mentioned, primary optic neuritis is very rare, while secondary optic neuritis is more common. Causes of secondary optic neuritis vary greatly. Possible causes include neoplasm, which is an abnormal cell growth, such as a tumor; systemic mycoses (a fungal infection); a parasitic disease known as toxoplasmosis; or lead poisoning. In some cases, the disease is considered idiopathic, meaning that it seems to arise spontaneously from an obscure cause and no specific origin can be identified.

Diagnosis

The diagnostic procedure in cases of suspected optic neuritis generally includes an analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (the clear protective fluid in the cranium, in which the brain floats), and an electroretinogram in order to investigate the functioning capacity of the eye’s retina. Additional diagnostic procedures may include a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, urine analysis, and full chemical blood profile for the presence of fungi, viruses, or protozoa that may be causing an infection. will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition in order to further aid your veterinarian in making a diagnosis.



Treatment

Treatment for optic neuritis is directly dependent upon the underlying disease that led to the condition. Certain procedures and medications may be given if the primary disease is identifiable. If no specific cause can be identified, certain medications may still be prescribed by your veterinarian to help alleviate symptoms. The final prognosis for animals with optic neuritis is dependent upon the underlying cause of the disease.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up visit to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment. If no primary cause can be identified and your pet is suffering from idiopathic optic neuritis, blindness or loss of vision may become permanent. Medication should be given as prescribed in order to prevent subsequent flare-ups."," and Types

217,Obesity in Cats,"What Is Obesity in Cats? 
A cat is considered overweight when it weighs 10-20% more than its ideal body weight, and obese when excess fat is more than 20% above its ideal body weight. Feline obesity is a very common disease, occurring in up to 63% of cats in developed countries. 

Being overweight poses significant health risks to your pet, which can include a weakened immune system, endocrine and metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and arthritis. Middle-aged (8-12 years old), neutered, indoor-only or primarily indoor cats tend to be more at risk for becoming obese. Diet and feeding strategies are important for weight management.

Symptoms of Obesity in Cats 
Besides visible weight gain, symptoms of obesity include: 


	
	Difficulty jumping or climbing stairs 
	
	
	Sitting or lying down more and showing an unwillingness to get up and move around  
	
	
	Loss of a visible waistline 
	
	
	Inability for pet parent to feel rib bones or hip bones 
	
	
	Looking down from above, your cat’s back appears flat and/or cat profile looks rectangular 
	
	
	Dirty, messy, unkempt hair coat 
	
	
	Collar keeps getting tighter 
	
	
	Less frequent bowel movements and/or more passing of gas 
	


Causes of Obesity in Cats
The reasons for obesity in cats can be broken down into two categories: animal-specific factors and diet-specific factors. 

Animal-specific factors 


	
	Age: Middle-aged cats 8-12 years old are more likely to be overweight than younger or elderly cats. 
	
	
	Neutered: Male and female neutered cats tend to have a stronger appetite than unneutered cats. 
	
	
	Environment: Indoor cats, or cats with restricted outdoor access, are more commonly overweight because of greater inactivity with fewer opportunities for exercise to burn calories.  
	
	
	Underlying health conditions: Food allergies can make selecting the best kind of food for weight management a challenge. Joint discomfort and arthritis can reduce mobility, and therefore energy use, increasing the risk of weight gain.  
	


Diet-specific factors  


	
	Type of diet: Feeding a diet of mostly dry food tends to promote weight gain in cats more so than a diet solely or primarily consisting of canned food.  
	
	
	Inaccurate food measurement: It is important to be consistent with food, and to use a scoop with a known measure (e.g., a ¼-cup measuring cup vs. a plastic cup) and feed out of a bowl size that is appropriate for measured food offered. Without these tools, the risk of over feeding a cat is more likely.  
	
	
	Rapid food consumption: If your pet eats too quickly, this can lead to boredom, crying and begging, which results in feeding your cat more food off schedule to keep him entertained and quiet. 
	
	
	Indulgent feeding practices: Feeding one or two large meals in the day may increase risk of obesity and begging in your cat compared to using free choice feeding or feeding small, frequent meals. 
	
	
	Excessive treats: Treats tend to be higher in fat and calories than a cat’s regular diet, so offering too many treats throughout the day quickly increases the total calories offered and can create a nutritionally unbalanced diet.  
	


How Vets Diagnose Obesity in Cats
Veterinarians diagnose obesity in cats by assessing body weight in combination with a Body Condition Score chart. All charts use comparable methods of assessment and include instructions to both look at and feel specific places on a cat. The reason body weight alone cannot be used to diagnose obesity is because two cats of the same weight may have very different amounts of fat disposition over their skeleton.   

Your vet will use visual assessments and assessments by feel to determine if your cat is obese at its current body weight. Visual assessments include checking for how well ribs and hip bones can be seen. They will determine whether a waistline is visible, and if there are obvious fat deposits under the belly. 

Vets will also use their palms to feel over the ribs to determine how well, or how poorly, rib bones can be felt. If a cat is severely obese, the ribs will be difficult to feel under a thick layer of fat, the spine and hip bones will also be covered by fat pads, and the belly will appear distended with no waistline visible.  

Vets may diagnose other conditions that are linked to obesity through a physical exam or with bloodwork. These findings may include joint discomfort on manipulation of your cat’s hips or knees; high blood pressure that shows underlying cardiovascular disease; or high blood glucose suspicious of diabetes.  

It is important to allow your veterinarian to do a thorough exam and perform bloodwork as needed to develop an appropriate and safe management strategy for achieving weight loss.  

Treatment of Obesity in Cats
It is also important for you to provide your veterinarian with an accurate description of your cat’s environment and the food provided, including all types of food offered, amounts (by weight or measured scoop), and times fed, so that an appropriate weight loss plan can be developed.  

Based on your cat’s health, your veterinarian will first calculate an appropriate target goal for calories fed per day to promote weight loss and then work with you to employ several strategies to tackle your cat’s obese condition: 


	
	Calorie-restricted foods: Most often a calorie-controlled food will be recommended to promote weight loss but maintain lean muscle mass. Low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets with higher protein and insoluble fiber are generally recommended to promote feeling full. 
	
	
	Dry vs. canned diet: It may be necessary to switch from a dry to a canned diet to best achieve nutrient goals. Remember to never leave moist food out at room temperature for more than 2-4 hours to prevent bacterial growth. Additionally, it is important to thoroughly wash these dishes with warm soapy water between feedings.  
	
	
	Prescription veterinary diets: “Metabolic-control” prescription veterinary diets may further help to promote weight loss because these diets aim to induce ketosis, where the body burns fat for energy instead of glucose from carbohydrates, rather than a total reduction in calorie intake. 
	


Remember that if you are changing your cat’s food type, it is important to slowly transition to the new diet over 7-10 days to prevent gastrointestinal upset. 

Once a diet is selected, your veterinarian will determine how much food to feed daily based on the caloric goal for weight loss. It is important that you accurately measure how much food is offered per day to meet that caloric goal and stay consistent. Weighing the food on a gram scale is the most accurate means of measurement. Using a specific volume measuring cup is the second-best way to ensure an accurate measure.  

You may also want to discuss feeding strategies with your vet to help make the plan successful. Talking points may include: 


	
	Bowl selection: Feed in an appropriate, cat-size bowl that appears full or almost full when food is added. Consider puzzle-feeders for those cats who need to be encouraged to slow down when eating. 
	
	
	Timed feeds vs. free choice: Discuss with your veterinarian which feeding strategy might work best for your lifestyle. 
	


When it comes to treats, have a conversation with your veterinarian about the importance of treats in your relationship with your cat. If your favorite part of the day is offering your cat a bedtime snack, it is important for your bond to keep that tradition going. Your veterinarian can work with you to select treats that are lower in fat and higher in fiber and incorporate the treats per day into the goal for total calories.  

Work with your veterinarian to be sure they understand your cat’s particular living situation and can address the weight loss plan from an environmental angle as well. Depending on your cat’s living situation and underlying health, you and your veterinarian may devise a plan to get your cat moving more. Some examples may include:  


	
	Incorporation of puzzle-type feeders to promote more activity during feeds.  
	
	
	If your cat is indoor-only and has limited movement but is otherwise agile and healthy, you can feed several small meals throughout the day on an elevated surface to encourage jumping.  
	
	
	For certain indoor cats who may feel more adventurous, you could fit her with a harness and incorporate a certain number of walks each day. 
	


Recovery and Prevention of Obesity in Cats
Prevention of obesity is key. Understanding the risk factors and working with your veterinarian to manage those can help discourage weight gain early on in your cat’s life. Once your cat has gained weight and is considered obese, weight management will be a life-long goal.  

Once a weight loss plan has been started, it is important to continually monitor your cat’s progress. It is important that you get a trustworthy scale at home and familiarize yourself with the body condition scales your veterinarian uses. These tools can be used at home to monitor your cat’s progress.  

Because weight management is a long road, it is important to remain patient during this process. Achieving weight loss in your cat can be a life-long process, with few immediate results. Pet parents with more patience tend to have more realistic goals for their cat’s weight loss over her lifetime, rather than expecting immediate results and abandoning the weight-loss plan when results are not observed.  

Additionally, the weight loss plan for your cat will need to be revisited several times throughout your cat’s life based on age, how successful weight loss is, and whether any other underlying conditions develop, so follow-ups with your veterinarian is essential for success. 
Obesity in Cats FAQsHow do I get my indoor cat to lose weight? The goal for weight loss in cats is to reduce calories and increase energy used. Work with your veterinarian to make sure your cat is on the right diet and being fed the correct number of calories per day for weight loss and try to get your cat moving at home by playing, jumping for meals, or even going on a harness-leash walk. Reduce any potential stressors in households with multiple cats or little kids by giving your cat a quiet place to retreat when needed and consider offering one or all meals in that separate place.
At what point is a cat overweight? Cats are overweight when they weigh 10-20% more than their expected body weight, where body condition is assessed as ideal. A cat is considered obese when their body weight is more than 20% above their expected body weight. 
Does obesity shorten a cat’s life?Yes, obesity is a disease that leads to the development of many other diseases that can shorten a cat’s life, like diabetes, certain types of cancer, metabolic diseases, and respiratory and heart diseases.

218,Nystagmus (Unintentional Eye Movement) in Cats,"What Is Nystagmus in Cats?
Nystagmus in cats is the involuntary rhythmic movement of the cat’s eyeballs. Nystagmus can be a normal reflexive movement, such as eye movement when a cat moves its head side to side (“doll’s eye reflex”).

When nystagmus occurs abnormally it is almost always associated with vestibular disease, a neurological condition where a cat experiences incoordination, falling, head tilting, and motion sickness, among other symptoms.

There are two types of pathologic nystagmus in cats:


	
	Jerk Nystagmus—The eyes move slowly in one direction away from an object and snap back quickly.
	
	
	Pendular Nystagmus—The eyes move with equal speed in both directions. This type of nystagmus is often seen in purebred Oriental cats (Siamese, Himalayan) and albino cats as a congenital defect in the visual pathway. Affected cats usually have other vision problems as well.
	


Nystagmus can also be categorized relative to head movement:


	
	Spontaneous—Eyes shift back and forth when the head is stationary. Eye movement can occur from side to side (horizontal), up and down (vertical), or circular (rotary).
	
	
	Positional—Eyes shift only when the head is moved in an unusual position (such as when the cat is placed upside down or flipped over on his back).
	


Nystagmus can be described as either conjugate (both eyes move in the same direction) or dysconjugate (each eye moves in opposite direction).

Nystagmus is not considered a medical emergency, but if your cat appears to be in pain or extremely uncomfortable, contact your veterinarian immediately.

Symptoms of Nystagmus in Cats
Nystagmus itself is a symptom of other conditions, particularly vestibular disease. But if not due to an underlying condition, nystagmus is not painful (though it can contribute to motion sickness).

In addition to nystagmus, a cat with vestibular disease may show symptoms such as falling or leaning to one side, head tilting, scratching at the ears, or stumbling, among many other signs.

Causes of Nystagmus in Cats
Nystagmus doesn't occur often in cats, but when it does, it almost always is due to vestibular disease.

Other related conditions include:


	
	Inner or middle ear infections—the most common cause of pathologic nystagmus
	
	
	Due to infection—feline panleukopenia (FIP), rabies, toxoplasmosis, or cryptococcosis  
	
	
	Idiopathic (unknown cause)­­—also known as feline vestibular syndrome, this condition often resolves without care
	
	
	Trauma
	
	
	Toxins – certain drugs like aminoglycosides or metronidazole (antibiotics) or chlorhexidine
	
	
	Nutritional (thiamine deficiency)
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Nasopharyngeal polyps
	
	
	Visual deficit—some lesions along the optic pathway
	


Certain Oriental breeds such as Siamese, Burmese, Himalayan, Persian, and Tonkinese are predisposed, and cats of any age can be affected.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Nystagmus in Cats
Nystagmus is often easily detected on physical examination alone. The veterinarian will identify the type of nystagmus present, which can help narrow down the possible causes. Categorizing the nystagmus helps determine which diagnostic testing to perform.

The vet often performs a neurological exam to identify any other neurological issues. Oral and ear (otoscopic) exams may be done, along with cultures to uncover possible infection. If bacterial infection is present, these tests can determine which antibiotic to prescribe.

The vet may recommend a myringotomy (surgical puncture of the ear drum) with a deep ear flush for both diagnostic sampling and treatment.

Other tests may be performed, such as:


	
	Baseline bloodwork, including a complete blood cell count
	
	
	Internal organ screening; urinalysis
	
	
	FeLV/FIV/FeLV and infectious disease PCR or titer testing. These are routinely performed to determine any underlying or associated causes
	


Other tests, such as advanced imaging (MRI and CT scan) or a cerebrospinal fluid tap, may be recommended to screen for infectious diseases, cancer, or inner ear infections. These are usually performed with a veterinary specialist.

Treatment of Nystagmus in Cats
Depending on the cause, some conditions can be cured where others can only be managed. Your veterinarian may recommend medication to reduce potential nausea and vomiting caused by nystagmus, such as chlorpromazine, meclizine, diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate. 

Other conditions such as ear infections and FIP might require steroids, antibiotics, or antifungals.  Ear infections may require ear cleanings along with several weeks of antibiotics. Ear cleaning itself often requires anesthesia or heavy sedation.

Treatment options for cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination. Nasopharyngeal polyps are surgically removed.

Nystagmus cases without a clear underlying cause usually require minimal to no therapy, as clinical symptoms improve within a few days, with a complete recovery seen in a few weeks. 

Recovery and Management of Nystagmus in Cats
Recovery often requires two to four weeks but can vary depending on the cause. Fortunately, cats are skilled at compensating for issues with their vestibular system. Some symptoms may worsen temporarily following treatment, but improvement should be noticeable within a few days. 

During this time, be sure to keep your cat comfortable, away from other pets and away from stairs, pools, sharp corners, and other potential dangers as its balance and coordination may be affected. An e-collar or recovery cone may also be needed depending on their treatment and whether surgery is involved.

Although your cat may recover, some deficits such as a head tilt may persist. If your cat has nystagmus or one of the listed causes, symptoms can reoccur.

Unfortunately, for some conditions such as FIP, there is currently no approved treatment and the prognosis is poor, and some cancers may not be treatable. Pet parents may opt for palliative care or humane euthanasia, depending on the cat’s diagnosis. 

Prevention of Nystagmus in Cats

Nystagmus cannot be prevented, but having your cat examined at the first sign of nystagmus may opt for a better prognosis and speedier recovery. Keeping your cat indoors, routinely examined, and up to date on vaccines is crucial, along with good ear hygiene.
Nystagmus in Cats FAQsIs nystagmus in cats painful?Nystagmus does not cause pain. However, it can affect a cat’s balance along with motion sickness, nausea, and vomiting. In many cases it is associated with other conditions, which can be painful. If your cat appears to be in pain, seek veterinary care immediately.
Is nystagmus in cats dangerous?Nystagmus itself isn’t considered dangerous, but it can be associated with dangerous conditions. Left untreated, it can result in serious health complications.
Does nystagmus in cats affect their vision?Most often, vision is not affected because only the eye muscles are affected. Some underlying causes of nystagmus, however, can affect vision.

219,Nose Cancer in Cats,"What Is Nose Cancer in Cats?
Nose cancer in cats is a condition in which abnormal cells grow into a malignant (cancerous) tumor within a cat’s nasal cavity. Nasal tumors make up 1% to 8.4% of tumors in cats. In a study of 123 nasal cavity tumors 92% were malignant.

Tumors in cat noses are often advanced by the time they are diagnosed because they usually aren’t visible externally until they’re quite large. Nasal tumors typically do not spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) but are known to grow into the surrounding bone and tissue, including the brain.

The life expectancy of a cat with nose cancer depends on the tumor type, size, and location. While treatment can result in a full recovery, recurrence rates are high. Cats who don’t receive treatment are unlikely to live longer than a few months after diagnosis.

Types of Nose Cancer in Cats

Several types of nose cancer in cats are based on the kind of cell they originate from.


	
	Lymphoma originates from white blood cells and is the most common type of nasal cancer. In a study of 65 cats with nasal tumors, 44.6% were lymphomas.
	



	
	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) originates from the lining, or squamous epithelium, of the nasal cavity. This cancer is typically slow-growing but can invade nearby tissues.
	
	
	Fibrosarcoma is rare and develops from connective tissue. It typically begins in one side of the nasal passage and slowly grows to the other.
	
	
	Chondrosarcoma is rare and arises from cartilage cells. It often begins on one side of the nasal passage and aggressively invades neighboring areas.
	


Additional types of cancer that can affect the nose in cats include:


	
	Melanoma
	
	
	Hemangiosarcoma
	
	
	Plasmacytoma
	
	
	Basal cell carcinoma
	
	
	Osteosarcoma
	
	
	Adenocarcinoma
	


Symptoms of Nose Cancer in Cats
Symptoms of nose cancer in cats can include:


	
	Face rubbing
	
	
	Nasal discharge
	
	
	Bloody nose
	
	
	Sneezing
	
	
	Snoring
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Seizures (if the tumor has invaded the brain)
	
	
	Facial changes such as swelling or deformity over the bridge of the nose
	


Causes of Nose Cancer in Cats
The risk of nose cancer in cats is likely influenced by many factors, including environmental exposure and genetic predisposition.

Cats exposed to cigarette smoke, air pollution in urban areas, and indoor pollutants such as cleaning chemicals, dust, or mold spores may be more at risk.

Certain viruses, such as a feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), or a compromised immune system may also contribute to nose cancer.

Males are more likely than females to develop nose cancer, as are older cats.

Some cancers on the outside hairless area of the nose, such as squamous cell carcinoma, are linked to sun exposure.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Nose Cancer in Cats
To diagnose nose cancer in cats, your veterinarian will start with a physical exam to check for things like facial symmetry and nasal airflow. They’ll collect information to rule out other causes of your cat’s nasal tumor, such as a fungal infection. Blood work and a urinalysis may be ordered.

Your cat’s vet may use a microscopic camera to investigate the nasal cavity, a procedure called rhinoscopy.

Imaging such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to investigate the tumor’s location and size.

Beyond X-rays, more advanced imaging diagnostics may be available only at a specialty clinic or university.

Your vet may collect cells from the tumor itself via a nasal flush or fine needle aspirate (FNA). FNA uses a small needle to suction up cells from the tumor, which are then viewed under a microscope. FNA may also be done on the lymph nodes to test whether the cancer has spread.

A biopsy, which involves removing a piece of the tumor to view it under a microscope, may be necessary if a definitive diagnosis cannot otherwise be made.

Be sure that your cat’s vet has access to medical records, especially if your cat has a history of tumors, nasal-related issues, or viruses.

It can also be helpful to write down your cat’s symptoms as you notice them, so that you don’t forget anything relevant to the diagnosis process.

Treatment of Nose Cancer in Cats
Treatment for nose cancer in cats depend on the type of nasal tumor and are tailored to each cat.

Radiation therapy is standard for treating nose cancer in cats because nasal tumors typically remain in one localized area. This treatment can target and destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Cats who complete radiation therapy may have survival times around a year.

Chemotherapy may be recommended if the cancer has spread.  Although cats with nasal lymphoma who don’t receive chemotherapy have an expected survival time of about a month, chemotherapy may triple this survival time to three months.

However, all cancer cases are unique, and a combination of treatment may be advised depending on your cat’s needs.

Surgery is not common because nasal tumors are in a sensitive area of the body, often in advanced stages when diagnosed, and difficult to remove. However, surgical removal may be possible for small external tumors affecting the skin of the nose.

When treatment is not an option, palliative care (relief of symptoms) may be suggested to keep your cat comfortable. This may include:


	
	Anti-inflammatory and pain medication (such as NSAIDs like piroxicam)
	
	
	Nutritional support, such as appetite stimulants or diets designed for oncology patients
	


Life expectancy for untreated nasal cancer varies, but survival times are likely limited to a few months. In one retrospective study, cats with nasal lymphoma left untreated lived an average of 28 days post-diagnosis.

Recovery and Management of Nose Cancer in Cats
The downside of many treatments for nose cancer in cats is their side effects.

With radiation, these may include hair loss, irritation of the eyes, and inflammation within the mouth or nose. These can be treated with medication if necessary.

Some types of radiation, like stereotactic radiation (SRS/SRT), are known to have fewer side effects and faster recovery times.

Chemotherapy often comes with side effects such as nausea and vomiting. These can become severe depending on the dosage and type of drug used. Medication may be prescribed to offset these symptoms.

Cats who have surgery may experience nasal discharge and swelling, which will go away after several weeks.

Following treatment, your vet will give you aftercare instructions and a list of items your cat will need. Some items may include:


	
	A comfortable cat bed
	
	
	Pill pockets
	
	
	A waterproof blanket
	
	
	A medicine organizer and dispenser

	Encourage your cat to eat and follow their vet’s dietary recommendations.
	
	
	Keep your cat indoors and secluded in a clean, small, quiet space with fresh water, food, and a litter box nearby.
	
	
	Monitor for increased nasal discharge or swelling that may indicate infection.
	
	
	Nasal cancer often recurs even when a positive outcome is initially achieved with treatment. Therefore, monitor your cat closely and be sure to keep all follow-up veterinary appointments.
	
	
	Call your cat’s veterinarian if you notice anything abnormal.
	


Prevention of Nose Cancer in Cats
Though not entirely clear, associations between nose cancer and FeLV, tobacco smoke, pollution, and dust suggest that reducing your cat’s exposure to environmental toxins and FeLV may help lower their risk of the disease.

Consider getting your cat vaccinated against FeLV, a vaccination recommended for all cats under one year of age and then annually, depending on a cat’s individual risk.

Regular vet exams can aid in the early detection of abnormal growths, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes.
Nose Cancer in Cats FAQsIf a nasal tumor is untreated, what is a cat’s life expectancy? The lifespan without treatment depends on the type of nasal cancer and the stage of the cancer (how far it has progressed or spread) at the time of diagnosis.

Cats with untreated nasal cancer will likely live only a few months, particularly if the tumor is within the nose rather than on the external skin.

221,Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats,"What Is Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats?
The clear surface of the eye is called the cornea. When the cornea becomes inflamed, it’s referred to as keratitis. This inflammation is often the result of an injury to the cornea called a corneal ulcer. When inflammation occurs that isn’t related to a sore or lesion, it’s called nonulcerative keratitis.

Besides injuries, several conditions can cause inflammation of the eye’s surface. Eosinophilic keratitis, stromal keratitis, and corneal sequestra are all more common causes of nonulcerative keratitis in cats. All of these conditions can be exacerbated by feline herpes virus infections.

Sometimes this condition is painful, but not always. If your cat is squinting and displaying signs of eye discomfort, it is important that you seek veterinary care right away. However, if your cat is not squinting and is eating, drinking, and behaving normally, it may not be an emergency and you can schedule a full ophthalmic exam with their regular veterinarian.

Symptoms of Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats
Here are some signs to watch for:


	
	White, tan, gray, or pink discoloration of the cornea
	
	
	Plaque-like, raised lesion on the surface of the eye
	
	
	Squinting
	
	
	Drainage from the eye
	
	
	Development of new blood vessels on the eye’s surface
	
	
	Presence of a clear-gray film over the eye
	
	
	Presence of a raised black spot in the middle of the eye
	


Causes of Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats
Feline herpes virus is a very common viral infection, affecting 80% or more of cats worldwide. Affected cats often experience sneezing, runny or watery eyes, and conjunctivitis. Some cats might experience additional complications from herpes, which can lead to lasting changes in the deeper layer of the cornea and chronic inflammation. The most common causes of nonulcerative keratitis in cats are:


	
	Feline eosinophilic keratitis (FEK)
	
	
	Stromal keratitis
	
	
	Corneal sequestrum
	
	
	Chronic keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye)
	


Feline eosinophilic keratitis (FEK) is one of the most common causes of nonulcerative keratitis in cats, often affecting cats under 4 years old. It involves eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, accumulating on the cornea. Cats with FEK typically develop plaque-like lesions on the surface of their eyes, which can appear white, tan, gray, or pink.

In cases of stromal keratitis in cats, white blood cells called lymphocytes invade the cornea in an attempt to fight the herpes virus. This invasion results in a haziness on the otherwise clear surface of the eye.

Certain breeds, such as Persians, Burmese, and Himalayans, have a predisposition to corneal sequestrum (a piece of dead tissue on the cornea). These breeds have more shallow eye sockets, leading to protruding and dryer eyes that are susceptible.

Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye, can also lead to nonulcerative keratitis. An infection with the herpes virus can lead to inflammation of an eye that already has poor tear film production. This can result in a black raised lesion on the eye called a sequestrum. Fortunately, this is not as common in cats as it is in dogs.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats
If nonulcerative keratitis is suspected, your veterinarian will start with a thorough ophthalmic exam. They will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look inside your cat’s eye.

One of the first steps in determining if a cat has nonulcerative keratitis is to rule out the presence of ulcers. This is done by staining the surface of the eye and looking to see if the stain collects in any scratches or defects on the cornea. The most common type of stain used is fluorescein, which is lime-green in color. If your veterinarian has suspicions of ulcers related to herpes virus, they may opt for an alternative stain called rose bengal.

After ulcers have been ruled out, your vet will likely check your cat’s eye pressure and tear production.

In some cases, your vet might recommend corneal cytology, a procedure in which a small amount of cells is collected from the surface of the eye for examination under the microscope. 

Treatment of Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats
While some causes of nonulcerative keratitis are treatable, many are related to an underlying infection with the feline herpes virus and may require chronic, long-term medication. Because many underlying causes of nonulcerative keratitis have a link to the feline herpes virus, antiviral medications may be prescribed. Topical antiviral products such as idoxuridine and cidofovir may be prescribed for use as eye drops. In some cases, oral antiviral medications like famciclovir could be recommended.

Often, supplementation with the amino acid lysine is recommended to support the immune system. Lysine comes in a variety of forms, from powder you can add to your cat’s food (Viralys®) to oral treats (VetriScience® Vetri Lysine).

Treatment often involves the use of topical anti-inflammatory medications, which can be either non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids. Steroid drops or ointment, such as 1% prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension or 0.1% dexamethasone ophthalmic solution, are sometimes prescribed. In some cases, topical antibiotics may also be necessary, often administered before steroid treatment starts.

Sometimes surgery is recommended for treatment. This is more likely if your cat has a corneal sequestrum. Following the surgery, your vet will likely prescribe topical antibiotics and/or pain medications for the recovery period.

Recovery and Management of Nonulcerative Keratitis in Cats
For most cats affected by nonulcerative keratitis, lifelong therapy is required. Response to treatment is usually fairly quick, with improvement often noted within a week or two. Once the eyes look clearer, the medications will be tapered to the lowest effective dose.

Given that the herpesvirus is often an underlying cause of this condition, flare-ups and recurrences of nonulcerative keratitis are common. While this can be frustrating, most cats respond well to treatment and have a good prognosis for a long and high-quality life.

222,Non-inflammatory Myopathy of Endocrine Origin in Cats,"This form of non-inflammatory myopathy is a type of muscle disease caused by endocrine maladies such as hypo- and hyperthyroidism. However, non-inflammatory myopathy of endocrine origin has also been associated with corticosteroid use.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Muscle weakness
    Loss of muscle bulk
    Stiffness
    Cramps
    Regurgitation
    Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia)
    Hoarseness (dysphonia)

 
Causes
 
Ultimately, this type of non-inflammatory myopathy is due to an endocrine disorder -- such as hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism -- but may be immune-mediated or neoplastic in nature.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) to determine the type of endocrine disorder. Your veterinarian will also conduct thyroid and adrenal gland functions tests to confirm the diagnosis.
 
X-rays are conducted to evaluate pharyngeal and esophageal functions -- especially in patients with regurgitation and dysphagia -- while muscle samples are sent to veterinary pathologist for further evaluation.

 


Treatment
 
Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of this disease. However, if the disease is due to an adverse reaction to corticosteroids, your veterinarian will adjust the dose or stop the corticosteroid administration altogether, which usually help in resolving the symptoms. Surgery may also be required in non-inflammatory myopathy cases with tumors.
 
Living and Management
 
Cats with this disorder will require special feeding techniques. You will briefed about elevating feeding and adding various foods to the dog's diet, especially foods of different consistencies. In cases of severe regurgitation, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube into the dog's stomach to ensure proper nutrition. He or she will also show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist in setting up a feeding schedule. In addition, cats may need physical therapy to strengthen their muscles and reduce wasting and weakness.
 
Overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause and extent of disease. If the disease is due to an adverse reaction to corticosteroids, for example, prognosis is positive if the treatment is stopped immediately. Muscle strength and mass should normalize within a few weeks."," and Types

223,Non-Inflammatory Hereditary Muscle Disease in Cats,"Non-inflammatory Hereditary Myotonia in Cats
 
Non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia is a muscle disease characterized by persistent contraction or delayed relaxation of muscles, especially during movement. Although it can be acquired later in life -- often experimentally induced with ingestion of herbicides -- this article pertains to congenital myotonia.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The symptoms below are commonly associated with non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia; they may improve after exercise and/or worsen due to the cold:
 

    Voice change
    Muscle stiffness
    Difficulty breathing
    Difficulty rising or moving
    Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
    Regurgitation, especially after eating
    Tongue may protrude from mouth

 
Causes
 
This type of non-inflammatory myopathy is hereditary; i.e., it is inherited by a mother and/or father with the same sarcolemmal defect, which affects the cell membrane of a muscle cell.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Creatine kinase enzyme levels may be elevated due to the dystrophin deficiency. Liver enzymes are also elevated in cats with this disorder.
 
During the examination, your veterinarian will tap on the surface of the cat's tongue, both while conscious and while anesthetized. Such tapping produce sustained dimpling on the surface of tongue, which will provide a clue for diagnosis.

 


Treatment
 
Although there is no specific course of treatment for non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia, there are certain medications (procainamide, quinidine, phenytoin, mexiletine) that help in decreasing the muscular stiffness and regurgitation. This, however, does not improve the abnormal gait associated with the disorder.
 
Living and Management
 
Discourage your cat from strenuous activities or exercise that may increase its respiration, and avoid cold, which may exacerbate the symptoms. Unfortunately, even with treatment, the overall prognosis of a cat with non-inflammatory hereditary myotonia is very poor. Your veterinarian will also recommend against breeding the cat to prevent further progression of the disease to the next generation."," and Types

224,Noisy Breathing in Cats,"Stertor and Stridor in Cats

 

Stertor is noisy breathing that occurs during inhalation. It is a low-pitched, snoring type of sound that usually arises from the vibration of fluid, or the vibration of tissue that is relaxed or flabby. It usually arises from airway blockage in the throat (pharynx).

 

Stridor is high-pitched, noisy breathing. The higher-pitched sounds result when relatively rigid tissues vibrate with the passage of air. It often occurs as the result of partial or complete blockage of the nasal passages or voice box (larynx), or collapse of the upper part of the windpipe (known as cervical tracheal collapse).

 

Unusually loud breathing sounds are often the result of air passing through abnormally narrowed passageways, meeting resistance to airflow because of partial blockage of these regions. The origin may be the back of the throat (nasopharynx), the throat (pharynx), the voice box (larynx), or the windpipe (trachea). Abnormal breathing sounds of this type can be heard without using a stethoscope.

 

The upper respiratory tract or upper airways includes the nose, nasal passages, throat (pharynx), and windpipe (trachea).

 

Noisy breathing is common in short-nosed, flat-faced (brachycephalic) cat breeds, such as Persians and Himalayans.  Affected short-nosed, flat-faced (brachycephalic) cats with inherited paralysis of the voice box (laryngeal paralysis) typically are younger than one year of age when breathing problems are detected. The acquired paralysis of the voice box (laryngeal paralysis) typically occurs in older cats. Cats are diagnosed less commonly than are dogs, with no obvious age pattern.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Change or loss of voice – inability to meow
	Partial blockage of the upper airways produces an increase in airway sounds before producing an obvious change in breathing pattern
	Unusually loud breathing sounds, may have existed for as long as several years
	Breathing sounds can be heard from a distance without the use of a stethoscope
	Nature of the sounds range from abnormally loud to obvious fluttering to high-pitched squeaking, depending on the degree of airway narrowing
	May note increased breathing effort; breathing often accompanied by obvious body changes (such as extended head and neck and open-mouth breathing)


 

Causes

 


	Condition of abnormal breathing passages in short-nosed, flat-faced animals (a condition known as brachycephalic airway syndrome), characterized by any combination of the following conditions: narrowed nostrils (stenotic nares); overly long soft palate; turning inside-out of a portion of the voice box or larynx (everted laryngeal saccules), such that the space for air to pass through the larynx is decreased; and collapse of the voice box or larynx (laryngeal collapse), and fluid build up (edema) of the voice box or larynx
	Narrowing of the back of the nose and throat (nasopharyngeal stenosis)
	Paralysis of the voice box or larynx (laryngeal paralysis) - may be inherited or acquired
	Tumors of the voice box or larynx - may be benign or malignant (cancer)
	Nodular, inflammatory lesions of the voice box or larynx (granulomatous laryngitis)
	Reduction in the diameter of the lumen of the windpipe (trachea) during breathing (tracheal collapse)
	Narrowing of the windpipe (trachea; tracheal stenosis)
	Tumors of the windpipe (trachea)
	Foreign objects in the windpipe (trachea) or other parts of the airway
	Inflammatory masses that develop from the middle ear or eustachian tube (nasopharyngeal polyps)
	Condition caused by excessive levels of growth hormone, leading to enlargement of bone and soft-tissues in the body (acromegaly)
	Nervous system and/or muscular dysfunction
	Anesthesia or sedation - if certain anatomy exists (such as a long soft palate) that increases susceptibility to abnormal, loud breathing sounds
	Abnormalities or tumors of the soft palate (the soft portion of the roof of the mouth, located between the hard palate and the throat)
	Excessive tissue lining the throat (redundant pharyngeal mucosal fold)
	Tumor in the back of the throat (pharynx)
	Fluid build-up (edema) or inflammation of the palate, throat (pharynx), and voice box (larynx) - secondary to coughing, vomiting or regurgitation, turbulent airflow, upper respiratory infection, and bleeding
	Discharges (such as pus, mucus, and blood) in the airway lumen – may occur suddenly (acutely) after surgery; a normal conscious animal would cough out or swallow them




Risk Factors


	High environmental temperature
	Fever
	High metabolic rate - as occurs with increased levels of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or a generalized bacterial infection (sepsis)
	Exercise
	Anxiety or excitement
	Any breathing or heart disease that increases movement of air into and out of the lungs (ventilation)
	Turbulence caused by the increased airflow may lead to swelling and worsen the airway obstruction
	Eating or drinking






Diagnosis

 

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the entire area from the pharynx to the trachea. If the sound persists when your cat opens its mouth, a nasal cause can virtually be ruled out. If the sound occurs only during expiration, it is likely that airway narrowing is the cause. If the abnormal sounds are loudest during inspiration, they are from disease other than in the chest. If you have noticed a change in your cat's voice, the larynx is the likely abnormal site. Your veterinarian will systematically listen with the stethoscope over the nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea to identify the point of maximal intensity of any abnormal sound and to identify the phase of respiration when it is most obvious. It is important to identify the location from which the abnormal sound arises and to seek the aggravating causes.

 

Internal imaging techniques, such as radiography and fluoroscopy, are important for assessing the cardiorespiratory system and to rule out other or additional causes of respiratory difficulty. Such conditions may add to an underlying upper airway obstruction, causing a subclinical condition to become clinical. X-rays of the head and neck may help to identify abnormal soft tissues of the airway. A computed tomography (CT) scan may also be used to provide additional anatomic detail.

 

In some cases, your cat's physiological inheritance can make the diagnosis more apparent, such as with cats that are brachycephalic. In these situations, your veterinarian will determine the location that is being most affected by your cat's conformation and decide where to go from there. 

 



Treatment

 

Keep your cat cool, quiet, and calm. Anxiety, exertion, and pain can lead to increased movement of air into and out of the lungs, potentially worsening the airflow. Low levels of oxygen in the blood and tissues, and decreased movement of air into and out of the lungs occur with prolonged, severe blockage to airflow; supplemental oxygen is not always critical for sustaining patients with partial airway collapse. In addition closely monitor the effects of sedatives that have been prescribed, as sedatives are known for relaxing the upper airway muscles and worsening the blockage to airflow. Be prepared for emergency treatment if complete obstruction occurs.

 

Extreme airway blockage or obstruction may require an emergency intubation (that is, passage of an endotracheal tube through the mouth and into the windpipe [trachea] to allow oxygen to reach the lungs). If obstruction prevents intubation, an emergency tracheotomy (a surgical opening into the windpipe [trachea]) or passage of a tracheal catheter to administer oxygen) may be the only available means for sustaining life. However, a tracheal catheter can sustain oxygenation only briefly while a more permanent solution is sought. Surgery may be required if a biopsy has indicated a mass in the airways.

 

Prevention

 

Avoid strenuous exercise, high ambient temperatures, and extreme excitement. Your veterinarian will advise you on the correct level of exercise to encourage in your cat.

 

Living and Management

 

Your cat's breathing rate and effort will need to be monitored closely. Complete blockage or obstruction could occur after an apparently stable patient is taken home or if continual observation is not feasible. Even with surgical treatment, some degree of obstruction may remain for 7 to 10 days due to postoperative swelling. Care will need to be taken during this time to protect your cat from complications due to labored breathing. 

 

After surgery, your cat may feel sore and will need proper rest in a quiet place, away from other pets and active children. You might consider cage rest for a short time, until your cat can safely move about again without overexertion. Your veterinarian will also prescribe a short course of pain killers until your cat has fully recovered, along with a mild course of antibiotics, to prevent any opportunistic bacteria from attacking your cat. Medications will need to be given precisely as directed, at the proper dosage and frequency. Keep in mind that over dosage of pain medications is one of the most preventable causes for death in household pets.

225,Nerve Sheath Tumor in Cats,"Schwannoma in Cats



Schwannomas are tumors that originate in the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is produced by the Schwann cell, a specialized cell which surrounds the peripheral nerves, providing mechanical and physical support for the nerves as well as insulating the nerves that transmit the nervous system’s electrical signals. The peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves outside of the central nervous system (brain and spine). Peripheral nerve sheath tumor is the term that has been proposed to include schwannomas, neurofibromas (nerve fiber tumors), neurofibrosarcomas (malignant nerve fiber tumors), and hemangiopericytoma (tumor of blood vessels and soft tissue), since they are all believed to arise from the same cell type. Schwannomas are more common with dogs than with cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Chronic, progressive forelimb lameness and muscle atrophy
	Lameness in the hind limbs
	Peripheral nerve disorder (from self-mutilation)
	Palpable mass (mass can be felt by touch examination)
	Horner's syndrome, a disease of the sympathetic nervous system: automatic nerve reaction, affects parts of the body not under direct control
	If the Schwannoma is in the neck, only one side of the face will be affected:
	
		Droopy eyelid
		One sided facial paralysis
		Decreased pupil size
		Slight elevation of the lower eyelid
	
	




Causes




	Idiopathic (unknown)




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) or, ideally, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide the most information regarding the extent and location of the disease. An electromyogram (a measurement of muscle activity) will show abnormal muscle activity if there is a schwannoma present.







Treatment



The treatment of choice is surgical removal (excision) of the tumor. Amputation of the affected limb is usually necessary, and local recurrence after surgery is common. A laminectomy (surgery of the spine to relieve pressure) is indicated with a schwannoma involving the nerve roots. Radiotherapy may be helpful, dependent on how far the growth has gone, and should be discussed with your veterinarian.



Living and Management



After surgical excision of schwannoma, 72 percent of all cases will have a recurrence. If this type of tumor is affecting the limb, the closer to the paw the schwannoma is the easier it will be to treat. Schwannomas only rarely spread to the regional lymph nodes or to the lungs, staying mainly in the nerve cells.

226,Nerve/Muscle Disorder in Cats,"Myasthenia Gravis in Cats

A disorder of signal transmission between the nerves and muscles (known as neuromuscular transmission), and characterized by muscular weakness and excessive fatigue, is clinically known as myasthenia gravis. The disorder is congenital (present at birth) and familial (runs in families or lines).

It can also be acquired (not inherited, but present later in life/after birth), but as with other autoimmune diseases, it requires the appropriate genetic background for the disease to occur. Multiple factors are involved, including environmental, infectious, and hormonal influences. Acquired forms are known to affect Abyssinian and Somali breeds.

The congenital form becomes apparent at 6-8 weeks of age. The acquired form has a bimodal age of onset. Either at 1-4 years of age, or 9-13 years of age. There may be a slight susceptibility for females in the young age group, but none in the old age group.

Symptoms and Types

The acquired form may have several clinical presentations, ranging from localized involvement of the esophagus' muscles, the muscles of the throat, the muscles adjacent to the eye, and acute generalized collapse.

Any cat with acquired enlargement of the esophagus, loss of normal reflexes, or a mass in the front central area of the chest should be evaluated for myasthenia gravis. Regurgitation is common, but it is important to first differentiate it from vomiting.

Physical findings

    Voice change
    Exercise-related weakness
    Progressive weakness
    Fatigue or cramping with mild exercise
    Acute collapse
    Loss of muscle mass usually not found
    Sleeps with eyes open
    May look normal when at rest
    Excessive drooling, repeated attempts at swallowing
    Difficulty breathing with aspiration pneumonia
    Abnormal position of the neck


Subtle nervous system findings

    Decreased or absent blink reflex
    May note a poor or absent gag reflex
    Spinal reflexes are usually normal but may fatigue


Risk Factors

    Appropriate genetic background.
    Tumor or cancer - particularly thymus tumor
    Vaccination can exacerbate active myasthenia gravis
    Methimazole (antithyroid drug) treatment may result in reversible disease
    Intact (non-neutered) female


Causes


    Congenital (present at birth)
    Immune-mediated disease
    Secondary to cancer


  

Diagnosis

There are other disorders of neuromuscular transmission, such as tick paralysis, that may have the same symptoms, so your veterinarian will want to rule them out before coming to a conclusion about the diagnosis. To do that, he will need a careful history, thorough physical and neurologic examinations, and specialized laboratory testing.

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also check for such things as thyroid functioning. Diagnostic imaging will include chest X-rays to look for an enlarged esophagus and aspiration pneumonia, and an ultrasound-guided exploration of the chest, to look for a mass. If a mass is found, a biopsy will need to be performed to confirm whether the growth is cancerous.

Treatment

Your cat will be hospitalized until adequate dosages of drugs achieve the desired effect. If your cat has aspiration pneumonia, it may require intensive care in a hospital setting. Nutritional maintenance with a feeding tube and multiple feedings of a high-caloric diet will be necessary if the cat is unable to eat or drink without significant regurgitation. Oxygen therapy, intensive antibiotic therapy, intravenous fluid therapy, and supportive care are generally required for aspiration pneumonia. If a tumor is found during exploration, surgery will be required.

Living and Management

You should see a return of muscle strength once the appropriate treatment has been found. Your veterinarian will want to perform chest X-rays every 4-6 weeks for resolution of the enlarged esophagus. Your doctor will also do follow-up blood tests every 6-8 weeks until your cat’s antibodies have decreased to normal ranges."," and Types

227,Nerve Disorder Affecting Multiple Nerves in Cats,"Peripheral Neuropathy (Polyneuropathies) in Cats



Unlike the central nervous system, which has the vertebrae of the spine, and the bone of the skull to protect it, the peripheral nerves are more exposed to the elements that enter into the body and come into contact with the body, so they are more susceptible to physical injury and toxic damage. The peripheral nerves are spread over the entire body. They are made up of the motor, sensory, autonomic, and/or cranial nerves, and are responsible for conscious, coordinated movement (somatic), for automatic physical responses (autonomic), and for the movement of the digestive system (enteric).



Polyneuropathy is a nerve disorder that affects multiple peripheral nerves. Peripheral in this case refers to the nerves that are outside of the central nervous system.



Symptoms and Types




	Motor and sensorimotor nerve disorders (automatic movement):
	
		Weakness or paralysis in all four legs
		Weak reflexes, or lack of reflexes (automatic physical responses)
		Weak to no muscle tone
		Muscle deterioration (atrophy)
		Muscle tremors, trembling
	
	
	Sensory nerve disorders (pain/pleasure nerve receptors):
	
		Spatial disorientation (inability to judge the space around oneself)
		Weakness to loss of consciousness
		No muscle deterioration
		No muscle tremors
	
	
	Under-active thyroid gland
	
		Paralysis of the voice box
		Paralysis of the throat/esophagus, affects ability to eat and drink
		Facial paralysis
		Dizziness, instability
	
	
	Dysfunctioning autonomic nervous system (not under conscious control) :
	
		Dry nose
		Dry mouth
		Dry eyes - low tear production
		Slow heart beat rate
		Lack of an anal reflex
	
	
	Primary feline hyperchylomicronemia:
	
		excess levels of chylomicron and triglycerides (fat particles) in the blood
		Nodules/lumps made up of lipid (fats and oils) masses, found under the skin, and/or in the abdomen
	
	
	Primary hyperoxaluria (a congenital disease of the kidneys in cats):
	
		Excessive oxalate is a naturally occurring salt that filters through the body as a digestive end product, but when combined with calcium, it hardens and forms into stones and solid deposits within the body, especially the kidney. Kidneys are enlarged, and painfully sensitive. Prognosis for this particular condition is poor
	
	




Causes



Myelin, the white, fatty, lipid material that acts as an insulator coat (also called a sheath) for some nerve fibers, can be lost through demyelination, a condition that causes the myelin to deteriorate, resulting in electrical signals in the nerves being lost, and impairing function. Or, there may be axonal degeneration with secondary demyelination. Axonal degeneration occurs when the actual nerve fibers deteriorate within the myelin sheath. Other possible causes are listed:




	Congenital/inherited
	
		Dysautonomia: abnormal functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which causes excessive body fluid output, lack of reflexes, and lack of coordination
	
	
	Immune-disease
	Metabolic disease
	
		Diabetes mellitus
		Hypothyroidism (under-active thyroid gland)
		A tumor in the pancreas, the gland that produces insulin
	
	
	Infectious
	
		FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus): affects cats and is infectious to other cats only
	
	
	Cancer medications
	Toxins
	
		Thallium: used in rodent poison
		Organophosphates: used in fertilizers and pesticides
		Carbon Tetrachloride: used in insecticides
		Lindane: used for killing weeds, insects, and lice
	
	






Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis will be used for confirming, or for ruling out any underlying diseases. Your veterinarian may also opt to perform additional blood tests, and a spinal tap, to look for specific disorders.



Chest and abdominal x-rays can be crucial for diagnosing visible peripheral polyneuropathies. X-ray and ultrasound imaging can help to rule out (or confirm) cancer, but the most important diagnostic tool for identifying peripheral neuropathies is electrophysiology – measuring the electrical flow of the body's tissues and cells. An analysis of tissue sample (biopsy) from the muscles or peripheral nerves can provide further information about the disease process your cat is experiencing.





Treatment



Animals can usually be treated on an outpatient basis. However, cats with acute polyradiculoneuropathies will have inflammation at the roots of the spinal cord nerves, and are at risk of respiratory failure. They should be hospitalized for observation in the early phase of the disease to prevent this. Cats with dysautonomia should be hospitalized to receive fluid therapy and/or administered (parenteral) feeding.



Cats with hyperchylomicronemia may spontaneously recover after two to three months of being fed a low-fat diet. Cats that have been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus should have their blood glucose and diet closely monitored.



An excellent related treatment for patients with peripheral polyneuropathies is physiotherapy, for encouraging restoration of the affected musculature and nerve memory.



Living and Management



It is important to understand that the cause of many polyneuropathies can never be determined, and treatment of the primary cause of polyneuropathy may not cure your cat. In some cases, the peripheral nerves will continue to deteriorate, and your cat's disease will worsen.



Cats that have been diagnosed with congenital or inherited forms of polyneuropathies should not be bred. Generally, it is advisable to neuter a cat that is suffering from this condition to prevent accidental breeding."," and Types

228,Neck and Back Pain in Cats,"It is often difficult to determine the exact location of the pain when an animal has been injured, because unfortunately, your cat can not tell you where it hurts. Your veterinarian may even have trouble determining the location. And because there are a number of reasons for neck and back pain, zeroing in on the underlying cause may take some time.

Symptoms and Types

Following are some of the possible symptoms your cat may show after an injury to the neck or back:


	Change in posture
	Back is curved upward
	The spine does not look/feel as it should
	Neck is stiff
	Your cat does not want to turn or raise its head
	Yelps or moans when you touch its neck or back
	Avoids being touched or moves away from you
	Moans or yelps when he moves the spine, refuses to move at all
	Visible trauma to areas around the spine, such as bruising, scratches, swelling
	Weak, lethargic
	Lack of coordination, cannot walk, wobbly movement (ataxia)
	Fever
	Lack of appetite (anorexia)


Causes


	Diseases of the muscles surrounding the spine:
	
		Soft tissue injuries
		Bite wounds
		Inflammation
		Infection
	
	



	Disc disorders:
	
		Degenerative discs
		Infection of the discs
		Instability of parts of the spine
	
	



	Trauma to the spine:
	
		Fracture
		Dislocation
		Cancer
		Vertebra
		Roots of nerves
		Tissues around the spine
		Membrane disorders in the brain and spine
		Kidney disease
	
	


 

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and any possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to provide as much detail as possible regarding your cat's health history, the onset of the symptoms and what type of symptoms have been representing, and what might have been the cause of the injury. The doctor will perform baseline blood tests, including a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a spinal fluid analysis. Other diagnostic tests that may be used for conclusively identifying the origin of the back pain are computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and X-ray imaging of the abdominal and spinal areas. Other essential tests include a neurological exam, and a myelogram, whereby a radiopaque agent is injected into the subarachnoid space in the spine so that the spine and nerves of the spine are more clearly visible on an X-ray image.

 

Treatment

Because the causes for neck and back pain are so varied, the treatment is determined according to the nature of the disease and the degree to which the spine's tissues are involved. Depending on your veterinarian's findings and the apparent indications for treatment, your cat may need to be hospitalized. Treatment will often call for medication, surgery, or both.

Some possible treatments include anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, antibiotics, and chemotherapy. Surgery, however, is required in case of spinal trauma, paralysis, disc or vertebrae infection, and/or cancer located near the spinal cord.

Living and Management

Your cat will require plenty of home care. Make certain to follow your veterinarian's instructions regarding medications and follow-up evaluations. Keep track of progress, watching for signs of improvement or relapse, and report them to your veterinarian. Avoid physically moving your cat, and take steps to prevent your cat from being overly active or taking part in activities that can lead to over exertion, including exercise, until it is approved by your veterinarian.

Also, it is essential that you protect your cat from active children and from other pets in the home. A quiet, closed room, or cage rest, may be necessary for ensuring that your cat has a safe space to heal and recover from its injury.

Some cats can recover quickly from neck and back injuries, however, an injury to the spine can be very serious and long-lasting, even life-threatening, if not treated promptly and effectively."," and Types

229,Narrowing of Vertebral Canal in Cats,"Lumbosacral Stenosis and Cauda Equina Syndrome in Cats
 
Cauda Equina Syndrome involves narrowing of vertebral canal, which results in compression of spinal nerve roots in lumber and sacrum regions. A cat's spine is composed of multiple bones with disks located in between adjacent bones called vertebrae. Seven cervical vertebrae are located in neck (C1-C7), thirteen thoracic vertebrae present from the area of shoulder to end of ribs (T1-T13), seven lumbar vertebrae are present in the area that starts from end of ribs to pelvis (L1-L7) and remaining vertebrae are called sacral and coccygeal (tail) vertebrae.
 
Pressure to or damage of the nerves within the spinal canal in the junction area between the lumbar and sacral vertebrae (sometimes called the cauda equine) due to narrowing of spinal canal can lead to this condition, also known as the cauda equina syndrome. This syndrome is rarely found in cats as compared to dogs. It can be seen in cats born with this problem (congenital) or acquire it in later life.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Lameness
    Pain in lumber and sacral regions
    Pelvic limb weakness and muscle wasting
    Weakness or paralysis of tail
    Abnormal tail carriage
    Urine and fecal incontinence (in some animals)

 
Causes
 
As stated earlier, cauda equina syndrome can either be a congenital or acquired condition, brought on by the instability of the lumbosacral junction or protrusion of disk between adjacent vertebrae.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are usually within normal range, unless some other concurrent disease is also present. Radiographic studies usually reveal valuable information for diagnosis. But for definitive diagnosis, your pet’s veterinarian will typically conduct Computed Tomography (CT-Scan) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) testing.

  



Treatment
 
Cats with urination problems are hospitalized for initial treatment (e.g., catheterization of bladder) until the patient regains control bladder function. Decompressing surgery is a treatment of choice and is often conducted to relieve the pressure of the nerve roots. If no treatment is conducted, the symptoms become severe due to progressive nature of this disease.
 
Even after surgery, however, some neurologic deficit may remain. Movements are restricted for at least four weeks after surgery. If surgery is not conducted, confinement and restricted leash walk is recommend along with pain control medications.
 
Living and Management
 
Avoid exercising your cat strenuously (jumping, running, etc.), as it may increase excessive pressure on the spine and cause symptoms to recur. Watch your cat for pain, lameness, urination and/or fecal elimination problems and notify your veterinarian immediately if you should notice any such untoward symptoms. Some diet modifications may also be recommended by your cat’s veterinarian to avoid obesity, which might also aggravate the condition.
 
Conform well to guidelines given by your cat’s veterinarian, especially directions regarding exercise, rest, and the diet of your cat. Without treatment, the condition of your cat may get worse due to progressive nature of this disease."," and Types

230,Narrowing of the Nasal Passage in Cats,"Nasopharyngeal Stenosis in Cats
 
Nasopharyngeal stenosis, a narrowing of the nasal section of the pharynx, occurs due to the formation of a thin but tough membrane in the passage of the nasal cavity. Any of the four portions of the nasal cavity may be affected and narrowed, including the common, inferior, middle, or superior portion. Chronic inflammation and subsequent fibrosis (the formation of excess fibrous tissue) after suffering an infection is one probable cause. Inflammation of the nasal tissues after chronic regurgitation, or vomiting of acidic material are also suspected to be causes of this problem. This disease may be seen in cats of any breed and age.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Whistling or snoring noise
    Extreme difficulty with breathing
    Breathing with open mouth
    Nasal discharge
    Aggravation of symptoms during 	eating
    Failure to respond to conventional 	therapy, including antibiotics

 
Causes


    Upper respiratory infections and 	diseases
    Foreign body, or any irritant 	contacting the affected area

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Standard laboratory tests including a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these routine laboratory tests are usually within normal ranges. Outward symptoms will suggest a need for radiographic studies, including X-rays and computed tomography (CT-scan) to diagnose the narrowing of the nasal passage. Your veterinarian may also pass a catheter through nasal passage or use a bronchoscope for further confirmation.
 
 
 
Treatment
 
Surgery is the treatment of choice in affected patients. The membrane will be excised and the wound sutured. A less invasive technique your veterinarian may use is balloon dilatation, by which a small balloon is inserted into the compromised nasal space and then slowly filled with air in order to widen the narrow passage. Balloon dilatation is usually performed using fluoroscopy, which provides real time moving images and simplifies the procedure. If surgery is conducted, antibiotics will be prescribed for few days to prevent infections.
 
Living and Management
 
Recurrence is not uncommon in patients that have had nasopharyngeal stenosis, even after successful surgery or balloon dilation treatment. In such cases a second procedure may be necessary for treatment. Watch your cat for any recurrence of symptoms and consult your veterinarian immediately if they should become apparent. Your cat may feel very sore after surgery and may need pain killers for a few days until the wound has healed completely. You may also need to administer antibiotics at home for few days after surgery. Give all prescribed medications at their proper dosage and time to enhance recovery time for your cat.
 
While your cat is recovering, avoid using products which may irritate the nasal passages, including scented floor products and air fresheners."," and Types

231,Narrowing of the Esophagus in Cats,"Esophageal Stricture in Cats

The esophagus is the tubular organ that runs from the throat to the stomach; an esophageal stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the internal open space of the esophagus. There is no apparent genetic factor involved, and it occurs in cats at any age.

Symptoms and Types


    Regurgitation (return of food or 	other contents from the esophagus)
    Liquid meals are often tolerated 	better than solid meals
    Difficulty swallowing is seen with 	upper esophageal strictures
    Howling, crying, or yelping during 	swallowing when the cat has active inflammation of the esophagus
    Good appetite initially; 	eventually, lack of appetite with progressive esophageal narrowing 	and inflammation
    Weight loss and malnutrition as 	the disease progresses
    Weight loss to severe weight loss 	with muscle wasting in cats with chronic or advanced stricture
    Excessive production of saliva and 	drooling, and/or reacting in pain when touched on the neck and 	esophagus may be seen in cats with inflammation of the esophagus at 	the same time the stricture is present
    Progressive regurgitation and 	difficulty swallowing may lead to aspiration pneumonia
    Abnormal lung or breathing sounds, 	such as wheezing and coughing, may be detected in cats with 	aspiration pneumonia


Causes


    Backward or reverse flow of 	stomach contents into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux) during 	anesthesia - most common
    Backward or reverse flow of 	stomach contents into the esophagus, unrelated to anesthesia 	(gastroesophageal reflux disease)
    Esophageal surgery
    Ingestion of chemical irritants
    Esophageal retention of pills and 	capsules
    Esophageal foreign object
    Persistent vomiting
    Cancer
    Mass lesion (known as a granuloma) 	secondary to the parasite Spirocerca lupi; occasionally seen in the 	southeastern United States


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will want to rule out many of the possible diseases or conditions that might cause these symptoms. For example, if your cat has just been weaned, an abnormality called vascular ring anomaly may be the problem. In order to arrive at a definite diagnosis, your doctor may conduct a barium-contrast X-ray, which uses a radiopaque fluid in the esophageal passage, so that the passage of the liquid shows on the X-ray image, revealing abnormalities in the passage. An X-ray may reveal a foreign body caught in the esophagus. An insertable visual diagnostic tool called an endoscope can also be useful for visually examining the esophagus in closer detail. Your doctor will also be looking for tumors and masses.



Treatment

Your cat may be kept in the hospital initially. Once hydration needs are addressed and the affected portion of the esophagus is dilated, you may be able to take your cat home. If your cat has aspiration pneumonia and/or inflammation of the esophagus, it may need to remain under medical supervision longer. Intravenous fluids may be needed for correcting hydration status and medications may be given by injection following dilation procedures to facilitate healing. Oxygen may be necessary for patients with severe aspiration pneumonia.

Also, cats that have severe inflammation of the esophagus, and those that have had dilation procedures will not be able to take food through the mouth. A temporary feeding tube may be placed at the time of esophageal dilation as a means of providing continual nutritional support. When you do restart feeding your cat by mouth you will need to give bland, liquid foods that are easily digestible. Your veterinarian will advise you on the most appropriate foods to help your cat through the recovery process.

Prevention


    Proper preparation prior to 	anesthesia (12-hour pre-operative fast)
    Avoid certain drugs prior to 	anesthesia, if possible
    If gastroesophageal reflux is 	present, avoid late-night feedings, as they tend to decrease the 	ability of the muscle between the stomach and esophagus to remain 	closed during sleep
    Protect your cat from ingesting caustic 	substances and foreign bodies


Living and Management

A barium contrast X-ray, a method which uses a radiopaque liquid in order to trace a passageway and to define abnormalities within, or endoscopy, using an insertable tubular instrument for visually examining the interior of the esophagus, will need to be repeated every two to four weeks until clinical signs have been resolved, and adequate esophageal lumen size (the inner space of the esophagus) has been achieved.

A life-threatening complication of esophageal stricture dilation, called esophageal tear or perforation, usually occurs at the time of dilation. This complication has been observed after several days to weeks have passed, so you will need to observe your cat for signs of this. Also, remain observant for symptoms of aspiration pneumonia due to food, liquid, or objects being pulled into the lungs, because the risk remains high. Generally, the longer the stricture, the more guarded the prognosis. With esophageal strictures due to scarring, the prognosis is generally fair to guarded. Many strictures will recur despite repeated esophageal dilation; improvement without cure is a more realistic goal."," and Types

232,Narrowing of the Anal or Rectal Opening in Cats,"Rectal Stricture in Cats
 
Rectal stricture occurs when a cat's rectal or anal opening is constricted due to the presence of scar tissue from inflammation, a previous injury, or an aggressive cancer growth. This narrowing of the opening(s) obstructs the passage of stool, thereby resulting in issues with the cat's digestive system. Rectal stricture is not hereditary.
 
Dogs and cats of both genders, and most breeds and ages may be affected by strictures. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dog, please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms will vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some symptoms include constipation, diarrhea, and difficulties while defecating. The feces is often be covered in mucus and blood-stained. There also may be a compensatory increase in the size of the cat's large intestine as a result of the stricture.
 
Causes
 
Both male and female cats suffer from strictures, as do most breeds and age groups. Although, cats that have had rectal or anal abscesses, inflammation, fistulas, a foreign body in the anal passage, or fungal infection are at a higher risk of sustaining the condition. Cuts or wounds in the area, cancerous growths, and some surgeries (e.g., removal of part of the rectum for biopsy) can also put animals at higher risk for developing strictures.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the history of its symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated the stricture. Some of the common tests include a complete blood count and a urinalysis, which will usually return as normal. If your cat has an existing infection or inflammation, the white blood count may be high.
 
A manual examination of the rectum might be required to determine the extent and location of the stricture. Ultrasonography of the abdominal area may also be performed; this might show thickening of the stomach walls and a change in the structure of the internal tissues, especially if cancer is present.
 
X-rays of the abdominal area and injection of contrast dyes (barium, air, or double-contrast enema) may show narrowing of the rectal and intestinal canal. These tests will be completed as a multi-step process: first, a warm water enema will be administered, followed by the dye injection six hours later. A combination of air and barium media is most effective for testing.
 
A colonoscopy, using a tubular, flexible camera inserted through the anal opening, will help your veterinarian visualize the stricture internally and to determine the extent of the stricture. This is also a convenient method for obtaining a tissue sample for further evaluation, which is helpful for determining if your cat has cancer, or a fungal or parasitic infection.
 

Treatment
 
Once your veterinarian has differentiated between other conditions and strictures, treatment will involve relieving the cat's pain and encouraging elmination of any waste still remaining in its intestines; this is done by using stool softeners, enemas, or drugs. Cats should be given plenty of fluids prior to the administration of the enema; some cats require anesthesia prior to the procedure.
 
Corticosteroids may also be given to regulate inflammation, but not before your cat is fully examined for the presence of an infection, since corticosteroids can have an adverse effect if infection is present.
 
The underlying cause of the stricture will then be treated in order to widen the cat's narrowed canal. If an infection is found, your veterinarian will prescribe medications -- either antifungals or antibiotics -- to eliminate the specific infection your cat has.
 
Surgery may be advisable for widening the narrowed opening. This can be done by using a balloon-like device to open the canal, or for milder strictures, a temporary stent may be used. For more extensive lesions, partial or complete removal of the canal may be required. Antimicrobial drug therapy may be prescribed to prevent infections during and after surgery.
 
If a cancerous tumor is found to be present, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be called for.
 
Living and Management
 
Be attentive to any recurring symptoms or signs in your cat. If the original cause of the stricture was cancer, symptoms of metastasis will be of concern. Some complications of medical management include ineffective treatment, diarrhea, dehydration, and adverse effects of medications.
 
If the veterinarian chose a balloon dilation procedure for the cat's treatment, be aware deep rectal tears, hemorrhaging, or full-thickness tearing of the intestinal walls may occur. However, cats with smaller strictures are usually treated easily and managed with balloon dilation.
 
Surgery may also result in fecal incontinence, secondary stricture formation, and opening of the wound site. Cats requiring surgery will usually have limited prognosis due to frequent complications."," and Types
 
Symptoms will vary depending on the severity of the condition. Some symptoms include constipation, diarrhea, and difficulties while defecating. The feces is often be covered in mucus and blood-stained. There also may be a compensatory increase in the size of the cat's large intestine as a result of the stricture.
 
"
233,Narrowing of Pyloric Canal in Cats,"Chronic Hypertrophic Pyloric Gastropathy in Cats
 
Pyloric stenosis, or chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy, is the narrowing of the pyloric canal due to an overgrowth of muscles of that region. This region of the stomach connects with the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown; it is rarely found in cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The severity of symptoms directly correlates to the extent of the pyloric canal's narrowing; these include chronic, intermittent vomiting (often several hours after eating), loss of appetite, and weight loss. Vomiting may contain undigested or partially digested food, and does not settle with the administration of drugs.
 
Causes
 
The exact cause for chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy is still unknown, though it is believed to be either congenital (existing at birth) or acquired later in life. Risk factors that may play a role in influencing the disease process include:
 

    Tumors
    Chronic stress
    Chronic gastritis
    Stomach ulcers
    Chronic increase in gastrin (hormone that stimulate secretion of HCL in stomach) levels

 
Diagnosis
 
Your cat's veterinarian will take a detailed history from you and perform a complete physical examination and laboratory tests on the animal. The results of routine laboratory tests, including complete blood profile, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, may be variable depending upon the underlying cause. In cats with severe ulceration, for example, anemia may be present. X-rays, meanwhile, may reveal a distended stomach due to stenosis of the pyloric canal. For more detailed results, your veterinarian may perform a gastrointestinal barium contrast study, in which barium sulfate is given orally to help highlight the location and extent of the narrowing on X-rays.

Another technique called fluoroscopy is sometimes employed. This imaging technique obtains real-time moving images of internal structures of the cat on camera with the use of a fluoroscope. The veterinarian may also employ endoscopy for detailed evaulation, in which he or she will look directly into the stomach and duodenum using an endoscope, a rigid or flexible tube that is inserted into the stomach and duodenum to visually inspect and take pictures of the region. Abdominal ultrasonography may also help in identifying the narrowing of the pyloric canal.
 


Treatment
 
Treatment depends upon the severity of the problem. After reaching a diagnosis, your veterinarian will decide the treatment, including surgery if required. Surgery is most commonly employed to correct the pyloric canal narrowing. Fluid therapy, meanwhile, is used to stabilize a dehydrated animal due to chronic vomiting.

Living and Management
 
Proper nutrition (highly digestible, low fat diet) and activity restrictions will be instilled by the veterinarian, especially when the cat has undergone surgery. If recurrence of the defect should occur, a more aggressive surgical intervention will be required.
 
Overall prognosis after surgery is excellent and most animals respond well. However, in the case of neoplasia, prognosis is not good."," and Types

234,Narrowed Bronchi in Cats,"Bronchiectasis in Cats

A cat's trachea, or wind pipe, is divided into two main bronchi, or tubes, which feed air into the lungs. The two tubes that begin the bronchial tree further divide into smaller branches, which further divide several more times to form bronchial tree.

In bronchiectasis, the bronchi are irreversibly dilated due to a destruction of the elastic and muscular components in the airway walls. This may occur with or without accompanying accumulation of lung secretions. Dilatation may be associated with infections of the bronchi, pneumonia, lung damage, chronic bronchitis (inflammation), decreased functional capacity of lungs, or abnormal cell growth (neoplasia).

This condition is rarely seen in the cat population, but when it does occur, it tends to affect older male cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Chronic cough (moist and 	productive)
    Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in 	some cats
    Intermittent fever
    Lethargy
    Exercise intolerance
    Rapid breathing
    Difficulty in breathing normally, 	especially after exercise
    Chronic nasal discharge


Causes


    Primary ciliary dyskinesia 	(malfunction of the mucous clearing cilia in the lungs)
    Long-standing infections
    Inadequately treated infections or 	inflammations in the lungs
    Smoke or chemical inhalation
    Aspiration pneumonia (pneumonia 	caused by food, vomit, or other content being breathed into lungs)
    Radiation exposure
    Inhalation of environmental toxins 	followed by infections
    Obstruction of bronchi due to a 	foreign body
    Neoplasia of the lungs


Diagnosis

There are variable causes which may lead to bronchial inflammation in your cat. Therefore, a detailed history and a complete physical examination are essential for diagnosis. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, the onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory testing will include complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profiling, and urinalysis. Blood gas analysis will indicate the functional capability of the lungs.

These tests will be helpful in looking for infections or other changes related to the underlying disease. Your veterinarian will also take x-ray images of the chest, respiratory tract, and bronchial tubes, which may or may not show abnormalities in the architecture of the lungs, including dilatation of the bronchi.

It is hoped that x-rays will reveal characteristic abnormalities in the bronchi that are related to this disease, but that is not always the case. Other changes in the lungs pertaining to chronic infections typically can be visualized using x-rays. Long term inflammation will leave evidence that can be visually examined. More sensitive testing, like computed tomography (CT) scanning, can be used for some patients, and this test may reveal more detailed information about structural changes within lungs. Your  veterinarian will also take samples of tissue and fluid from the bronchi for laboratory evaluation.



Treatment

In case of severe disease, your cat may need to be hospitalized for a few days. Emergency treatment will be given to overcome the crisis. Fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, and removal of viscid fluid from lungs will be conducted. Antibiotics are often used to eradicate the infectious organism, and physiotherapy can be used to enhance the clearance of secretions from lungs. Your veterinarian will recommend minimizing any exposure to irritants such as dust, smoke, aerosol compounds, and air fresheners, which can further complicate the disease. Anti-inflammatory medications may help to reduce your cat's symptoms, making breathing easier. In severe cases, surgical removal of the affected lung lobe may be required.

Living and Management

If disease is affecting a small area of the lungs, the affected lung lobe will be removed in order to effectively resolve the underlying disease. Prognosis is excellent for animals that are treated early, before significant inflammation or permanent scarring has taken place.

Even in patients with resolution of the underlying disease or removal of the affected lobe, secondary infections are common. This is due to the diffuse nature of this disease, which often leads to complications. Or, some patients may take longer to completely recover due to the chronic nature of problem, the age or previous health condition of the cat, or because another underlying disease was not cured.

You will need to visit your veterinarian at regular intervals so that your cat's progress can be followed, and so therapy and medication changes can be made appropriately, depending on your cat's status. Follow-up care is of paramount importance in improving the prognosis for your cat.

You may need to devote extra care and affection to your cat during the recovery period, also paying strict attention to the medication guidelines and scheduling in order to prevent further complications. Extra patience will be required, as you assist your cat in its daily needs, and keep it protected from undue stress. A calm and quite space, away from active children and pets, will help your cat to rest and heal.

Do not use anything in the home that will place unneeded stress on your cat's bronchial airways. Fireplaces, air fresheners, cleaning products and chemicals are just some of the things that can irritate your cat's respiratory tract. A place set aside where your cat can be taken when you are using any of these products is the best measure for protecting your cat from an attack on its bronchial tubes.

If you see a return of any of the symptoms described above, immediately call your veterinarian or take your cat to a veterinary hospital. It is not uncommon for a recurrence of emergency crisis to occur in these cases.

The prognosis is highly variable depending on the nature of the disease, the areas of the lungs being affected, the diffuse or focal nature of the disease, and the presence or absence of concurrent infections in the body. If treated properly, these patients can live well for number of years."," and Types

235,Narcolepsy and Cataplexy in Cats,"Attacks of Sleep and Weakness in Cats

Narcolepsy and cataplexy, disorders that affect the way an animal is able to physically operate, are rare but well studied disorders of the nervous system. Narcolepsy is symptomized by excessive daytime sleepiness, lack of energy, and brief losses of consciousness. The episodes are typically brief and go away by themselves. Cataplexy is characterized by sudden muscle weakness and paralysis without loss of consciousness. A cat that is affected by cataplexy will remain alert and capable of following movement with its eyes throughout the episode. Cataplexy is similar to narcolepsy in that the episodes are spontaneous, brief, and reversible. Individuals may be affected with one, or both of these disorders.

Symptoms and Types

A cat that has either of these conditions will not always have any secondary or underlying conditions related to it. A physical exam will usually show normal physical and neurologic responses with no obvious abnormalities. This is not a fatal disease, but it is one that requires attention and awareness. Narcoleptic and cataplectic episodes can last from several seconds up to 30 minutes, and often will take place when the cat is eating, playing, excited, or is engaging in sexual activity. Cataplexy in particular is characterized by episodes that occur during moments of heightened emotion. During a narcoleptic episode, the affected cat will collapse onto its side or stomach, its muscles will slacken, and all physical movement briefly ceases. It is just as if the cat has suddenly fallen into a deep sleep. Closed eye movement continues, as with the stage of REM sleep. During a cataplectic episode, the cat is aware and conscious of what is going on around it, its eyes  remain open and under the cat's control, but it is otherwise paralyzed. The cat typically will come out of the episode in response to external stimuli, such as when it hears a loud sound or is petted.

Some of the usual symptoms of narcolepsy and cataplexy are:


    Rapid 	onset of episodes, with no apparent warning of imminent collapse
    Sudden 	loss of consciousness
    Paralysis 	of limbs, head, and torso
    Episodes 	last from several seconds up to 30 minutes
    Eye 	movement, muscular twitching, and whimpering during episodes
    Episodes 	usually end when stimulated by petting, loud noises, etc.


Causes

Generally, narcolepsy and cataplexy are categorized as idiopathic, since there has been no connection to an underlying cause. Some of the suspected causes that are still being studied are disorders of the immune system, and disorders of the nerves.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to rule out any underlying diseases. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, the onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. If it is possible to visually record a narcoleptic or cataplectic attack, it will help you and your veterinarian in finding a pattern to the episodes, if there is a pattern. If there is an activity that appears to consistently bring about episodes, your veterinarian will attempt to simulate the activity so that an episode can be observed first-hand. A food-elicited cataplexy test may also be performed, since many animals with cataplexy have attacks while eating.

Treatment

Your veterinarian will try to determine what is behind the episodes by mapping patterns in your cat's behavior before an episode takes place. By finding these patterns, such as in particular activities, foods, or times of day, you may be able to predict with some surety when your cat will have an episode. Although you may not be able to prevent episodal attacks of narcolepsy or catalepsy, you may be able to reduce the frequency and duration of them. Watching for small signs of an oncoming episode, and being prepared to gently bring your cat out of it can help the incident to pass quickly. These attacks can appear to be severe, but they are not life threatening. Your cat is neither suffering nor in pain while it is undergoing this neurological episode, and there is no need to be concerned about it choking on food and/or having its airway obstructed if an episode occurs while it is eating. But, there are other safety issues to take into account. If the episodes are frequent, are happening in vulnerable situations, or are otherwise very concerning, there may be medications your veterinarian can prescribe to help control the frequency or duration of the attacks.

Living and Management

If your pet has this condition, you will want to supervise its activities when it is doing anything that might place it in a vulnerable position. For example, sexual activity can bring on a level of excitement that can cause an episode; meeting new people or animals, or playing outside, can place your cat in a situation where it is vulnerable to harm due to its inability to protect itself or run away. If this is the case, you will need to be aware and on guard so that your cat does not find itself in a problem situation, and needless to say, you will need to keep your cat indoors at all times."," and Types

236,Myeloproliferative Disorders in Cats,"Myeloproliferative Disorders are a specific type of disorders involving excess cell production originating from the bone marrow. Although they are not associated with neoplastic tissues, like other cancers, myeloproliferative disorders are classified within blood cancers.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Lethargy
    Weakness
    Pale mucous membranes
    Weight loss
    Enlargement of liver and spleen

 
Causes
 
Myeloproliferative Disorders are most commonly associated with Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) infection. It may also be seen in cats recovering from panleukopenia or hemobartonellosis infections
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC), which should glean valuable information regarding the morphology of blood cells and other abnormalities. Blood testing may also reveal severe non-regenerative anemia, in which the bone marrow responds inadequately to the increased demand of red blood cells. Other abnormalities may include megaloblastic red blood cells (abnormally large red blood cells) or leukocytosis or leukopenia.
 
Abdominal X-rays are usually taken to reveal abnormal enlarging of the liver or spleen, while bone marrow biopsies reveal detailed information related to abnormalities in various cell line production and maturation.


 


Treatment
 
Although no specific treatment has been developed for cats with myeloproliferative disorders, antibiotics are used to treat and prevent secondary infections. You may need to consult a veterinary oncologist for further evaluation and treatment, including the use of chemotherapeutic agents.
 
In severe cases, your cat may need to hospitalized and undergo fluids therapy and blood transfusions to correct dehydration and anemia, respectively. Unfortunately, the prognosis of cats suffering from these disorders is poor.
 
Living and Management
 
Regular blood testing and bone marrow examination is recommended during treatment to determine the cat's response to the therapy and the progression of the disorder. In addition, chemotherapeutic agents used in treatment are potentially toxic to humans and should only be after receiving instructions from your veterinarian."," and Types

237,Myelin Deficiency in Cats,"Hypomyelination in Cats

A fatty substance that covers the axons (the portions of the  nerve cells that transfer impulses to other cells of the body), myelin serves an important function for the nerve cells: as an insulator, protecting the nerve from outside influences, and as an aid for forwarding the process of cellular transmission of nervous system actions. Therefore, hypomyelination, or an insufficient production of myelin in the body, can be devastating for the central nervous system (CNS). It can even cause tremors, which are most apparent when the cat is active.

CNS hypomyelination has a higher rate of diagnosis in the Siamese breed.

Symptoms

Central nervous system:

    Clinical signs appear within days of birth
    Body tremors that worsen with activity and decline during rest
    Symptoms generally improve by one year of age


Peripheral Nervous System:

    Clinical signs appear at 5–7 weeks of age
    Weakness
    Incoordination of the rear limbs (ataxia)
    Muscle wasting
    Hyporeflexia (below normal or absent reflexes)
    Symptoms do not resolve with age


Causes


    Cause is unknown, but viral or toxic sources are considered, especially since symptoms often resolve
    Peripheral nervous system disease origin is undetermined, but is suspected to be genetically based


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and your cat's genetic background. Standard tests include a blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.

Diagnosis is based on the clinical signs that your cat is presenting, but for a conclusive diagnosis, your veterinarian will take a sample/biopsy of the nerve to analyze for sufficient myelin at the axon of the nerve. Your doctor may also choose to perform a brain biopsy. Other techniques include electromyography, which measures the electrical activity and potential of the muscle cells. In this case, the finding is usually normal to mild spontaneous activity. Motor nerve conduction velocity can be used to assess the ability of the motor and sensory nerves to conduct electricity. With hypomyelination, there is usually slowed conduction or only a small amount of potential.

Treatment

There is no effective treatment available for either peripheral or central hypomyelination.

Living and Management

Due to the genetic bases of this disease, if your cat has been diagnosed with this nerve disorder, you will be advised not to breed your cat, or to further breed the parent of the diagnosed kitten. If your cat is affected by CNS hypomyelination, the nervous symptoms will usually improve my the time your cat reaches its first year of age. With PNS hypomyelination, affected cats are expected to have a normal lifespan.","

238,"Mushroom, Mold, Yeast Poisoning in Cats","Mycotoxicosis (Tremogenic Toxins) in Cats
 
The term “mycotoxicosis” is used to denote poisoning by food products contaminated by fungi (i.e., moldy bread, cheese, English walnuts, or even a backyard compost). As well as being toxic to humans, fungi release various toxins, also called mycotoxins, that are toxic to animals. However, this is found to be rare in cats as compared to dogs.

You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and any possible exposure to mushrooms, moldy food, or decomposing organic matter. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests will help rule out other causes for tremors and seizures.
 
More advanced tests (thin-layer chromatography, bile analysis) are available to analyze the contents of the stomach and vomit, which should definitely confirm or refute the diagnosis.

 


Treatment
 
A cat suffering from mycotoxin poisoning is the type of emergency which will need immediate hospitalization and treatment. Your veterinarian will pump the cat's stomach and, if it is not convulsing, give activated charcoal to absorb the toxic material in the stomach and intestines. Overall prognosis is good if treatment begins soon after ingestion of the fungi.
 
Living and Management
 
Watch your cat for recurrence of symptoms and call your veterinarian immediately if tremors, seizures, or any other untoward symptom develops. Most cats recover within 24 to 48 hours after treatment. However, some animals may recover more slowly and take a few weeks for the symptoms to subside.
 
Prevention
 
In order to prevent your cat from eating raw mushrooms or other moldy food material, you should remove any harmful items from the backyard and safely secure a compost heap, should you have one. It is also helpful to pay attention to your cat when it roams outdoors."," and Types
 
The severity and type of symptom will ultimately depend on the amount and type of mycotoxin ingested. Some of the more common symptoms associated with mycotoxicosis include:
 

    Muscle tremors
    Seizures
    Panting
    Hyperactivity
    Vomiting
    Uncoordinated movements
    Weakness
    Increased heart rate
    Increased body temperature
    Dehydration
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)

239,Muscle Tear in Cats,"Muscle Rupture in Cats

Normal activity can cause a  disruption in a muscle. A normal muscle can be stretched, pinched, or injured directly, resulting in fiber disruption, weakening, and immediate or delayed separation of the uninjured portions. Alternatively, the muscle structure may be compromised by systemic or iatrogenic (physician-caused) conditions. The rupture may be complete or incomplete, and may be in the middle of the muscle or at the muscle-tendon junction. The acute (sudden and severe) stage is characterized by a typical inflammatory reaction that becomes chronic over time, with cross-linking, and adhesion development over time. Frequently, the acute phase is overlooked, as the signs may be temporary and respond well to rest. The chronic effects are often progressive and unresponsive to support therapies.

The muscles of the limbs, and the chewing muscles are the primary structures affected. Traumatic injury is indiscriminate, though certain activities may predispose a cat to muscle injury because of exposure. This is a relatively rare condition in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Acute injury

    Immediate lameness that is 	characterized by the specific muscle affected
    Localized swelling, heat, and pain
    Generally present for a few days to a week
    Chronic phase (if it develops)


Progressive

    Painless
    Usually associated with scar tissue that impedes normal function of an extremity


Causes

Trauma

    Overextension
    Myositis (inflammation)
    Degenerative (unknown etiology)
    Myopathy (a neuromuscular disease), secondary to medical conditions




Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination on your cat, looking for evidence of neurologic dysfunction and tendon rupture. Diagnostic imaging will include X-rays to look for evidence of bone fragment defects and translocations, and ultrasound to look for swelling and disorientation of the normal muscle fiber at the site of injury in acute cases. Scar tissue and contracted areas of fibrous tissue can be seen in the muscle in chronic cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to look for edema and hemorrhage, and to achieve localization of the problem that will help to identify the type of problem.

Your doctor will also test your cat’s joints for evidence of joint instability or malalignment. Measurable differences between normal and abnormal sides may be useful in documenting the affected muscle site. Another thing your doctor can do is conduct a biopsy of the affected muscle to detect the presence of fibrous tissue and loss of muscle cells. Differentiating atrophy due to disuse from neurologic atrophy, and from injury-induced scarring, may be impossible without corroborating evidence.


Treatment

There is no documented evidence to support a single best way to treat acute muscle injuries, or to prevent fibrous contracture (shortening of muscular or connective tissue) and adhesions. It is generally believed that immediate post injury care should involve rest and local cold application followed within hours by heat and passive physical therapy. An essential part of muscle repair is effective tension relief for the injured muscle so that healing can occur without disruption as function returns. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs should be used for several days to weeks to control inflammation and pain. Light or non-weight bearing activity is appropriate for an extended period of time (4-6 weeks).

Internal or external orthopedic devices may be necessary to provide effective tension relief. Scar-related problems can affect your cat’s gait in the long-term. It is inappropriate to hospitalize or cage a recently injured animal for muscle problems unless surgical repair is planned. Surgery may be performed within a few days of the injury to repair obvious, acute muscle rupture that results in a separation of the uninjured muscle segments.

Once the muscle injury becomes chronic and is associated with contracture or adhesions, treatment is aimed at function salvage of the muscle. Instantaneous symptomatic relief often accompanies surgical release of the adhesions or fibrous tissue bands. The prevention of re-adhesion and progressive contracture is much less rewarding.

Specific muscle injuries have widely disparate prognoses. Rotator cuff contracture responds well to surgical excision of the tendon of insertion. Gracilis (hamstring) contracture has a 100 percent recurrence rate after surgical resection. Quadriceps contracture has a similarly dismal failure rate after surgery.

Muscle injuries that have healed in an elongated state have a better prognosis for surgical improvement of function than contracted muscles. The most common elongation injury affects the muscles of the Achilles group. Hock hyperflexion can be surgically reconstructed to return affected cats to relatively normal function. Shortening the Achilles tendon rather than surgically repairing the injured muscle usually accomplishes this.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to monitor repetitive range of motion, along with taking steps to control inflammation. Non-weight bearing passive physical therapy may be beneficial for recovery."," and Types

240,Muscle Contraction Disease (Myoclonus) in Cats,"Myoclonus in Cats
 
Myoclonus is a condition in which a portion of a muscle, entire muscle, or group of muscles contracts in a coarse, repetitive, involuntary, and rhythmic manner at rates up to 60 times per minute (sometimes even occurring during sleep). These abnormal contractions occur due to nervous dysfunction and most commonly affect groups of muscles involved in chewing and/or any of the skeletal muscles of the limbs.
 
Myoclonus is rarely seen in cats and is more common in dogs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Involuntary, continuous, coarse, and rhythmic contractions of a muscle, portion of a muscle, or group of muscles is the most common sign to look out for. However, there are other symptoms your cat displays that are related to the underlying disease causing myoclonus.
 
Causes
 

    Congenital
    Due to infections 
    Drug-induced (e.g., chlorambucil)

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including any illnesses it may have recently suffered from and symptoms it has displayed. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which may show abnormalities related to underlying cause, including inflammation of brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis). He or she may also take a sample of your cat's cerebrospinal fluid (a protective and nourishing fluid circulate around brain and spinal cord) or administer an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) on the animal.




Treatment
 
The course of treatment for myoclonus will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Cats with inflammation of brain and spinal cord, for example, are given medication to reduce swelling.
 
Living and Management
 
This problem usually continues indefinitely, although remission is possible. Watch for symptoms that may be associated to the treatment for brain and spinal cord inflammation, and call your veterinarian if they should worsen. The cat may require a new diet or movement restriction depending on the severity of the disease."," and Types

241,Mucopolysaccharidoses in Cats,"Metabolic Disorders Due to Lysomal Enzyme Deficiency in Cats
 
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of metabolic disorders characterized by the accumulation of GAGs (glycosaminoglycans, or mucopolysaccharides) due to the impaired functions of lysosomal enzymes. It is the mucopolysaccharides which help in building bones, cartilage, skin, tendons, corneas, and the fluid responsible for lubricating joints.
 
Domestic shorthair and Siamese cats are predisposed to mucopolysaccharidoses.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Dwarfism
    Severe bone disease
    Degenerative joint disease (DJD), including partial dislocation of hip joint
    Facial structural deformity
    Enlarged liver
    Eye cloudiness

 
Causes
 
Mucopolysaccharidoses is a genetic abnormality. However, inbreeding increases the risk, especially if the defective gene is present in the family.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis, including the presence of characteristic granules within neutrophils and monocytes (types of white blood cells). Your pet’s veterinarian will also take a sample from other body sites and organs -- such as the liver, bone marrow, joints, and lymph nodes -- for further analysis.
 
Definitive diagnosis, however, is typically made by measuring the lysosomal enzyme levels in blood or liver. Bone X-rays, meanwhile, will reveal decreased bone density and other bone- and joint-related abnormalities.


 
Treatment
 
If a bone marrow transplant is conducted at an early age, the cat may be able to live a “near normal” life. However, this treatment is expensive, life-threatening, and not very helpful at a mature age. Also, a healthy donor is required for bone marrow transplant.
 
Enzyme replacement therapy is effective in cats with mucopolysaccharidoses, but this, too, is an expensive recourse and has not been widely used in animals. Gene therapy, meanwhile, is thought to be an effective method of treatment, and is under evaluation for the treatment both in humans and animals.
 
Living and Management
 
Overall prognosis in cats that have undergone bone marrow transplants is usually good. However, as the cat gets older, it will suffer from various problem, including eating difficulties. Therefore, they will require softer and easily palatable foods. Cats with mucopolysaccharidoses are also prone to infections and may require antibiotic therapy.
 
Due to the genetic nature of this group of disorders, your veterinarian will recommend against breeding cats with mucopolysaccharidoses."," and Types

What Are Mouth Ulcers in Cats?
An ulcer is defined as a break in the skin or mucous membrane (lining), with eventual loss and death of the tissue. Often, an ulcer appears as a highly inflamed, erosive (loss of tissue), reddish lesion. In cats, oral ulcers—or ulcers that affect any of the lined surfaces of the mouth such as gums, palate, tongue, lips, inner cheeks, or pharynx—are a common medical condition with various causes, some of which are not well understood. These can cause significant pain and debilitation for your cat.

Types of Mouth Ulcers in Cats

Kissing ulcers, or those that arise where the gum contacts the plaque and calculus of the tooth, can lead to stomatitis in cats, an inflammatory condition affecting most of the mucosal surfaces within the mouth. Stomatitis is still not well understood, but it is believed to be an exaggerated immune response toward the teeth and/or the secondary plaque and calculus that adhere to tooth surfaces.

Indolent ulcers are often seen in cases of eosinophilic granuloma complex, and attributed to an underlying allergy. These are typically seen as a brown-red lesion on your cat’s upper lip, but other lesions can be seen inside the mouth and on the skin.

Any type of mouth ulcer indicates greater disease may be present, and your cat needs to be examined by a veterinarian immediately.

Symptoms of Mouth Ulcers in Cats
Pet parents may notice an ulcer around or inside a cat’s mouth. Your cat may also experience multiple signs attributed to oral pain, including:


	
	Reluctance to eat or dropping of food
	
	
	Pawing at the mouth or rubbing face on the floor
	
	
	Unkempt hair coat due to lack of grooming
	
	
	Bad breath
	
	
	Swollen gums
	
	
	Excessive drooling or blood-tinged saliva
	
	
	Pain or aggression when pet parent tries to open or close the mouth
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Swelling of the local lymph nodes
	


Causes of Mouth Ulcers in Cats
By far the most common cause of mouth ulceration in cats is periodontal disease or related conditions, such as tooth root abscesses, cysts, and stomatitis. Other causes, though less frequent, include:


	
	Infections such as herpes virus, calicivirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
	
	
	Autoimmune diseases
	
	
	Inflammatory and allergic conditions, such as eosinophilic granuloma complex
	
	
	Metabolic diseases, such as kidney disease/uremia
	
	
	Toxins/chemical agents, including certain kinds of plants
	
	
	Burns (electrical and thermal)
	
	
	Radiation therapy
	
	
	Trauma and foreign bodies
	
	
	Cancer
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Mouth Ulcers in Cats
When a pet presents with signs of oral pain, your veterinarian will look for signs of inflammation, infection, swellings, masses, and tooth problems in the mouth. Ulcers are generally uniform in appearance, so diagnosis is straightforward.

However, the underlying cause may not be quite as easy to find, and additional tests may be needed to reach a diagnosis, including:


	
	Bloodwork (CBC, internal organ function, and FeLV/FIV screening)
	
	
	Dental cleaning and oral radiographs performed under anesthesia
	
	
	Biopsies, in which a piece of the ulcerative tissue is surgically removed and sent for evaluation
	
	
	Cultures
	


Treatment of Mouth Ulcers in Cats
Treatment often depends on the underlying cause. Periodontal disease and its associated complications will require a thorough and professional anesthetic dental cleaning and radiographs. Cats suffering from stomatitis will most often require tooth extraction, and in some cases will require extraction of all teeth.

For cats unable to undergo anesthesia or have teeth extracted, medical management can temporarily alleviate symptoms. However, this will not cure the condition and the cat will continue to suffer long-term. Medications may be prescribed:


	
	Antibiotics
	
	
	Steroids
	
	
	Immunosuppressive drugs, such as Cyclosporine
	
	
	Immune modulators, such as interferon
	


Regardless of the treatment pursued, because mouth ulcers are painful, pain medication should be prescribed at the onset of treatment. For severe cases, a feeding tube may need to be surgically placed and maintained until your cat is feeling well enough to eat on its own. 

At home, dental care with daily brushing, dental wipes, antiseptic rinses or gels, water additives, and/or dental diets are encouraged for long-term management. Speak with your veterinarian about the best option for you and your cat.

Additionally, for those cats who have allergies, including eosinophilic granuloma complex, your veterinarian will most likely prescribe a change of diet, such as a novel protein diet or a hydrolyzed diet, where the protein is broken down into smaller molecules that are less likely to trigger an immune response. Keeping your cat on strict flea control will also be recommended, as well as allergy testing.

Recovery and Management of Mouth Ulcers in Cats
Many cats can go on to live relatively normal lives once the underlying condition is resolved and/or managed. Most commonly, a few weeks is all cats need to get better, and just because they developed ulcers in the past doesn’t necessarily mean they are prone to getting them again. A small percentage of cats suffering from stomatitis may require long-term intervention with medications, even after full-mouth extraction.

Cats that have or are predisposed to allergies will often be managed long-term with medications and directions to adhere to a prescription diet.
Mouth Ulcers in Cats FAQsHow can pet parents prevent mouth ulcers in cats?Unfortunately, for most causes, there is little prevention you can do to help your cat. However, pet parents are advised to cat-proof their home as much as possible, and to provide your cat with multiple routes for dental care. At the bare minimum, brushing your cat’s teeth daily is by far the best care you can give going forward. Fortunately, the prognosis is usually excellent once the condition is controlled.
Are mouth ulcers painful for cats?Mouth ulcers are undoubtedly painful. Your veterinarian will most likely speak to you about the different options for pain control during your cat’s disease.

243,Mouth Cancer (Melanocytic) in Cats,"Oral Melanocytic Tumors in Cats

 

Oral tumors can be extremely debilitating and painful disease for cats, often resulting in death. Melanocytic tumors, which are the third most common oral tumors in cats, arise from a local invasion by neoplastic menlanocytic cells (melanin-producing cells) to the gingival surface. These tumors are usually raised, irregular, ulcerated, have a dead surface, and are highly aggressive and invasive to the bone. In fact, such tumors may cause death as they render an animal unable to eat and metastasize to other body parts.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Loose teeth
	Bad breath (halitosis)
	Face deformities
	Excessive salivation (ptyalism)
	Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
	Oral discharge containing blood
	Weight loss (cachexia)


 

Causes

 

The underlying cause for oral melanocytic tumors is currently unknown.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform various laboratory tests, including a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal -- as well as a physical examination, especially of the oral cavity.



Your veterinarian will also take a small deep tissue sample from the mass in the oral cavity, including a part of bone to be sent to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. Such biopsy samples are usually helpful in making a definitive diagnosis. In addition, X-rays of the oral cavity, skull, and lungs will help in the evaluation of the extent and location of metastasis.







Treatment

 

After reaching a definitive diagnosis and careful evaluation, your cat’s veterinarian, in consultation with a veterinarian oncologist, will plan surgery to excise the tumor mass along with part of the bone involved. Your veterinary oncologist will also suggest chemotherapy in combination with radiation therapy to further enhance the treatment's effectiveness. Soft foods are recommended after surgery to prevent tumor ulceration and to ease out ingestion of food.

 

Living and Management

 

Prognosis depends upon the stage, location, extent of metastasis, and extent of the tumor mass removed during surgery. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis in most cats is not good and most die due to rapid loss of body weight, an inability to swallow correctly, and the spread of the tumor. Treatment, therefore, is directed toward improving the animal's quality of life.

 

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication to help minimize your cat’s discomfort, which should be used with caution (one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication). Follow all your veterinarian's directions carefully and limit your cat's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest away from household activity, children, and other pets.

 

It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. Due to involvement of the oral cavity, these patients are not able to take feed for number of days. Your veterinarian will devise a diet plan, which will include highly palatable and nutritious foods. As affected cats already have a tendency to lose weight, providing food to keep body weight within normal range is of utmost importance. 

 

In addition, chemotherapy medications have the possible toxic side effects, so your veterinarian will need to closely monitor your cat's stability, changing dosage as necessary. He or she will also conduct routine X-rays of the skull and lungs, and ask you to bring the cat in for regular evaluation visits to check progress and for recurrence."," and Types

244,Mouth Cancer in Cats,"What Is Mouth Cancer in Cats?
Cancer is unregulated and abnormal cell growth, usually resulting in masses or tumors. When cancer occurs in the tissues of the mouth, it's usually very aggressive.

Mouth tumors occur in approximately five out of every 1,000 cats. Studies estimate that 3–12% of malignant (cancerous) tumors in cats are found orally, making mouth cancer the fourth most common cancer in cats. Up to 85% of oral tumors are malignant.

It’s not unusual for mouth cancer in cats to be advanced before it’s noticed, and many tumors are deeper and larger than they appear. Some oral cancers are slow-growing, and cats may show few symptoms. Other types are aggressive and can quickly spread (metastasize) to your cat’s lungs, jawbone, and lymph nodes, leading to a poorer outcome.

Cats who were diagnosed with the most common type of oral cancer and not given treatment had a median survival time of 1.5 months.

Types of Mouth Cancer in Cats

There are 22 types of mouth cancer in cats. However, some are more common than others. These include:


	
	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—SCC is the most common mouth cancer in cats and makes up about 65% of oral tumors. Oral SCC can be aggressive and often invades the mandible or maxilla (lower or upper jawbone).
	
	
	Fibrosarcoma—Fibrosarcomas develop in connective tissue and are commonly found in the gums. Fibrosarcomas are typically slower growing but can invade nearby healthy tissue.
	
	
	Adenocarcinoma—Adenocarcinomas are relatively uncommon in cats. These tumors usually originate in the salivary glands and often spread to the lymph nodes.
	
	
	Chondrosarcoma—Chondrosarcomas originate in the cartilage of the oral cavity. These tumors are slow-growing and may appear to be noncancerous, but eventually destroy nearby tissue.
	
	
	Ameloblastoma—Ameloblastomas originate from the tissues that form teeth. While rare, these tumors can be highly invasive when they are cancerous. If they can be removed completely, they usually have a good prognosis.
	


Symptoms of Mouth Cancer in Cats
Symptoms of mouth cancer in cats may include:


	
	Bad breath
	
	
	Drooling
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Tooth loss (most associated with SCC)
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Facial swelling
	
	
	Bulging of the eye
	
	
	Bleeding from the mouth
	


Causes of Mouth Cancer in Cats
There is no single known cause of mouth cancer in cats. Several factors—including environment and genetics—likely contribute to a cat’s risk of developing the disease.

One study comparing cats with oral SCC to those without the disease found that cats who wore flea collars were five times more likely to develop oral SCC than those who did not, and cats who ate mostly canned food, particularly canned tuna, were three times more likely to develop SCC. Additionally, cats who lived in households where they were exposed to secondhand smoke were two times more likely to develop SCC.

Mouth cancer is more common in older cats—the average age of diagnosis is 12 years old—although it’s possible for younger cats to develop the disease.

One study found that of 146 cats with oral tumors, 88.4% were European shorthairs, and reporting suggests that Siamese cats are more likely to develop adenocarcinoma.

Males and females are equally likely to develop mouth cancer, although there is evidence that gingival fibrosarcoma (oral tumor affecting the gums) is more prevalent in male cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Mouth Cancer in Cats
You can prepare for your cat’s veterinary appointment by taking pictures of the tumor and writing down any symptoms they have. This can help you document changes in the tumor’s appearance and ensures you don’t forget anything that would aid in a diagnosis.

You can also review your cat’s medical records and make sure the vet has them, especially if your cat has a history of tumors or oral issues.

To obtain a diagnosis of mouth cancer in cats, your cat’s veterinarian will start with a physical exam. They may also perform a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or biopsy to diagnose the tumor’s type. FNA involves inserting a needle into the tumor, gathering cells, and viewing them under a microscope. A biopsy is more invasive and involves removing a piece of the tumor to examine it under a microscope. The tissue is often sent to a veterinary pathologist for a more thorough review.

Mouth tumors are often larger than they appear and can mimic less serious conditions, so additional tests may be recommended. Further testing may include X-rays of the head and advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both CT and MRI are ideal for determining the tumor’s extent and whether it can be removed surgically.

Treatment of Mouth Cancer in Cats
Surgery is typically recommended for cats with mouth cancer but is often unsuccessful because oral tumors can be deep and difficult to remove.

Aggressive surgery like lower jaw removal (mandibulectomy) may be needed to get all of the tumor out. If successful, some patients can live years after surgery.

Radiation can decrease a tumor’s size and relieve pain, but regrowth is typically rapid once radiation is completed, necessitating additional rounds of treatment. Radiation may be ineffective for deeper tumors that cannot be penetrated.

Chemotherapy may not be useful for a single tumor in one location and is more likely to be prescribed for cancer that has metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body.

A combination of treatments may be most effective. For example, radiation can help control regrowth of tumors after surgery, and chemotherapy can help treat cases that have spread.

When a cure is not possible, palliative care can improve your cat’s quality of life. Your veterinarian may suggest several options, such as:


	
	Anti-inflammatories, such as piroxicam, to help with swelling and pain
	
	
	Pain medication, such as buprenorphine
	
	
	Appetite stimulants, such as mirtazapine and cyproheptadine
	
	
	A temporary or permanent feeding tube
	


Recovery and Management of Mouth Cancer in Cats
Following treatment, your veterinarian will communicate with you about aftercare instructions, a recovery timeline, and future appointments. Here are some ideas of what you can expect.

Cats who receive surgery will be sore, and those who undergo a partial or full jawbone removal may stay in the hospital for several days.

Once home, there are many ways you can support your cat’s recovery from surgery:


	
	Put them in a small, quiet space, and keep food, water, and a litter box nearby.
	
	
	Switch to soft foods. If your cat gets a feeding tube, your veterinarian may suggest a liquid diet.
	
	
	Exercise patience. Your cat may need to be hand-fed as they adjust to physical changes involving their mouth.
	


Your cat’s mouth may also be tender after radiation therapy, and soft food can be helpful.

Chemotherapy can cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Be sure to monitor your cat and let their vet know if side effects become severe.

Regardless of treatment, always give medications as prescribed, prioritize follow-up appointments, and call your vet if you suspect anything abnormal.

Items that may be helpful for your cat’s recovery include:


	
	A high-calorie soft food
	
	
	A comfortable waterproof blanket
	
	
	An enclosure pen
	
	
	Feeding syringes
	


Prevention of Mouth Cancer in Cats
Although there are few ways to prevent mouth cancer in cats, regularly taking your cat to the veterinarian and routine dental prophylaxis (professional cleaning) can result in an earlier diagnosis and better treatment outcomes.

Though definitive links remain unclear, exposure to cigarette smoke, flea collars, and canned tuna have been connected to mouth cancer, and limiting exposure may reduce your cat’s risk.

If possible, brush your cat’s teeth regularly to maintain their oral hygiene and to notice any changes in their mouth.

245,Miscarriage in Cats,"Spontaneous Abortion, Pregnancy Loss in Cats



It is not uncommon for cats to experience spontaneous abortions (miscarriages). A variety of medical reasons can cause this reaction. The cat should be evaluated immediately after a miscarriage to make certain more serious underlying health conditions do not exist.



Symptoms and Types 



If a cat has experienced a miscarriage, the most common thing an owner notices is abnormal and extended vaginal bleeding. There may also be an abnormal amount of discharge. An expelled fetus may be found, especially if the cat was in the late trimester.



Causes 



The most common cause of a lost pregnancy is fetal death due to a hormonal imbalance. Some other causes include:




	Mycotic Abortion – This fungus most commonly causes excessive bleeding in the uterus and can lead to an aborted fetus.
	Fetal Death – If the cat has a hormonal imbalance it can lead to the fetus' death, either causing stillbirth or miscarriage. Fetal deaths may also be related to genetic disorders of the fetus itself, causing the pregnancy to be terminated.
	Neospora Caninum – This parasite, while found in cats, is more common in dogs. It is usually picked up when a cat eats food or drinks water shared with a contaminated dog.




Diagnosis 



A standard blood test is used to detect the presence of parasites or other medical conditions in the cat. A health care professional can use an ultrasound to detect a viable pregnancy, or to look for anything remaining in the cat's uterus following a miscarriage. Occasionally, the cat’s uterus will be unable to expel all of the pregnancy matter effectively on its own (e.g., placental tissue), leading to infection or internal hemorrhaging.







Treatment



For cats that have experienced a spontaneous abortion due to bacteria or parasite, a veterinarian will diagnose the condition and offer a variety of options for medical treatment. In addition, the cat should be carefully monitored for signs of a more serious medical condition.



Living and Management 



Following a spontaneous abortion, there can be a great deal of discomfort and/or some vaginal bleeding or abnormal discharge. In many cases, some long-term bacterial issues arise. Pet owners should carefully observe the behavior of their cat to ensure no serious problems develop."," and Types 



If a cat has experienced a miscarriage, the most common thing an owner notices is abnormal and extended vaginal bleeding. There may also be an abnormal amount of discharge. An expelled fetus may be found, especially if the cat was in the late trimester.

246,Mid-Chest Inflammation in Cats,"Mediastinitis in Cats

An inflammation of the mid-chest area is usually caused by a bacterial infection or a fungus. It’s rare in cats, but in severe cases it may be life-threatening. It is also likely to spread, infecting the bloodstream.

Abscesses sometimes develop and the short vein (called the cranial vena cava in animals) that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body to the heart's right atrium may become infected. These abscesses can cut off the flow of blood to the heart, resulting in death.

Symptoms


    Gagging
    Drooling
    Difficulty      swallowing
    Vomiting
    Lethargy
    Swelling      of the head, neck, and front legs
    Difficulty      breathing
    Fever


Causes

Cats often try to eat and swallow inedible things, often causing blockage in the esophagus. This is followed by drooling, gagging, difficulty swallowing, and vomiting — the usual signals for blockage. These and other signals may be depend on the location of the foreign object, the degree to which the esophagus is obstructed and the length of time of the blockage.

A partial obstruction, for instance, may allow fluids to pass, but not food. If the obstruction has been there for an extended period of time, the cat may refuse to eat, lose weight and/or become more tired. The foreign object may puncture the esophagus, resulting in an abscess, inflammation of the chest cavity, pneumonia, or abnormal breathing. Even after the foreign object has been removed or regurgitated, pneumonia may develop.

Another possible cause of mediastinitis is a blow to the neck or chest, or a wound to those areas.

Diagnosis 

Tests of various kinds will be conducted to rule out a range of possible causes for the symptoms; among these:


    Blood      tests will determine whether there is an infection and what that infection      is
    Chest      radiographs (X-rays)
    X-rays      are used to identify any foreign bodies
    A      scope of the esophagus with contrast dye may also be necessary
    Thoracic      ultrasonography
    CT      scan or MRI of chest
    Biopsy      of tissue from the chest
    Cytology      (evaluation of fluid or abnormal tissue collected from the chest cavity)
    Bacterial      and fungal cultures and antibiotic sensitivity testing of fluids,      aspirates or biopsy samples taken from the chest




Treatment

If your cat has a severe infection, it will require hospitalization. A drainage tube is usually inserted into the lungs and intravenous (IV) fluids will probably be used to balance electrolytes until your cat is able to eat again. And if there is an abscess, surgery will be required.

If there is a foreign body, it will generally be removed with a flexible endoscope and forceps. If the foreign body has smooth edges, a tube with suction may work to get it out. For sharp foreign bodies such as fish hooks, a large tube may be placed over the endoscope to draw the item out without tearing up the esophagus.

If all of these methods fail, the foreign body may be pushed into the stomach where it can move through the digestive tract or be surgically removed. If the foreign object has perforated the esophagus, surgery will also be required. This is the worst possible scenario because the esophagus does not heal very well.

The veterinarian will put the cat on a regimen of antibiotics if it is determined that the infection is bacterial. If the infection is due to a fungus, the animal will be put on antifungal drugs. However, a cat will be on an antibiotics regimen for a relatively short time as compared to antifungal treatment, which may last as long as six months. Antibiotics can also be prescribed after removing the foreign object to prevent infection.

Living and Management

You will need to keep track of the cat's temperature daily. If it is hospitalized, blood tests will be conducted every two to three days, for up to a week. X-rays of the lungs will be taken every seven to ten days.

The antibiotics regimen will usually continue for a week after the blood tests and X-rays find no more infection. And for another four to six weeks if an abscess was found originally.","

247,Metabolic Muscle Disease without Inflammation in Cats,"Non-inflammatory Metabolic Myopathy in Cats
 
Non-inflammatory metabolic myopathy is a rare muscle disease associated with metabolic disorders like various enzyme defects or storage of abnormal metabolic byproducts and others. Unfortunately, little is known about how the disorder affects cats exactly.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Muscular weakness
    Cramps
    Exercise intolerance
    Regurgitation and/or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
    Collapse
    Dark urine
    Vomiting
    Abdominal distention

 
Causes
 

    Congenital (born with this problem) error in metabolism
    Acquired (later in life) problems in metabolism
    Viral infections
    Drug exposure
    Environmental factors

 
Diagnosis 
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which may show abnormalities related to metabolic problems involved. For example, the biochemistry profile may show abnormal levels of serum creatine (enzyme found in muscle, brain, and other tissues) and abnormally low levels of glucose (hypoglycemia).

Your veterinarian may also choose more enzyme assays and other specific testing to determine the cat's levels of amino acids, organic acids, and creatine. DNA-based tests, meanwhile, are used to identify specific carriers.
 
Often, a muscle tissue sample will be sent to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. This may reveal abnormal accumulation of fats or glycogen within muscle cells.


 


Treatment
 
Treatment varies with the type of metabolic defect and extent of your cat's symptoms. In most cases, there is little to be done for those suffering from metabolic defects.  If the cat suffers from seizures, decreased body glucose, or brain issues, it will need to be hospitalized and placed in intensive care.
 
Living and Management
 
Depending on the type of metabolic defect, diet restrictions may be put in place, especially if the defect has led to hypoglycemia. Discuss with your veterinarian about a feeding plan and do not allow the cat to exercise strenuously.
 
Overall prognosis depends on the type and extent of the metabolic defect, but a veterinarian will always advise against breeding the cat due to high probability of passing along the defect."," and Types

248,Metabolic Enzyme Deficiency in Cats,"Lysosomal Storage Diseases in Cats

Lysosomal storage diseases are primarily genetic in cats and are caused by a lack of the enzymes that are needed to perform metabolic functions. It is a rare disease that most commonly is diagnosed in kittens. The disease causes an accumulation of various substances that would otherwise be eliminated by the enzymes, and which become stored in the cat’s tissues in abnormal amounts (usually occurring in the nervous system). As a result, cells swell and can no longer function normally. Unfortunately, lysosomal storage diseases are always fatal.

The following breeds are most likely to have the disease:


    Persian
    Siamese
    Korat
    Domestic      shorthair
    Balinese


Symptoms and Types of Lysosomal Storage Diseases

Affected animals are usually born normal but develop symptoms within the first few months of life. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency but may include:


    Failure      to thrive
    Balance      problems
    Exercise      intolerance
    Inconsistent      behavior
    Compromised      vision
    Fainting
    Seizures


Diagnosis of Lysosomal Storage Diseases

If your cat has these symptoms and is one of the previously listed breeds, your veterinarian will want to know your cat’s history so that an initial diagnosis can be made. The following tests are likely to be performed to confirm the diagnosis:


    Complete      blood count
    Biochemical      profile
    Urinalysis
    X-rays      of chest and abdominal area
    Ultrasound      of abdomen
    Biopsy      of tissue
    Enzyme      measure 




Treatment for Lysosomal Storage Diseases

If the cat is weak and dehydrated, an IV will be inserted and fluids and electrolytes will be administered. A dietary plan will be also be arranged to ward off hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Activity must be limited. Your cat will need to be restricted to a safe area where it cannot become injured, preferably a comfortable carrier or small confined area. Careful monitoring is required because there is a high risk of developing secondary infections.

Living and Management of Lysosomal Storage Diseases

Restrict activity and be alert to the cat's symptoms. In addition, maintain the prescribed nutritional plan. Blood sugar, growth, and hydration status must be monitored regularly. This disease is progressive, and unfortunately, it is ultimately fatal.

Remember that the disease is genetic and inbreeding should be carefully avoided when there is a defective gene anywhere in the family. Cats that have been diagnosed with the disease should also never be mated."," and Types of Lysosomal Storage Diseases

Affected animals are usually born normal but develop symptoms within the first few months of life. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the enzyme deficiency but may include:

"
249,Mesothelioma in Cats,"Mesotheliomas are rare tumors derived from the cellular tissue that lines the cavities and interior structures of the body. These linings are called the epithelial linings. The mesothelial lining, specifically, is a membranous epithelial lining that is derived from the mesoderm cell layer, with its main functions being to line the body cavity, to cover and protect the internal organs, and to facilitate movement within the body cavity (coelom).

Mesotheliomas are the result of abnormal division and replication of mesothelial cells, and their migration to other sites in the body. This cellular behavior can occur in the thoracic cavity, the abdominal cavity, and the pericardial sac around the heart. The resultant tumors will often displace internal organs, causing gastrointestinal or cardiac symptoms. Mesotheliomas also produce a lot of fluid, making microscopic (cytologic) examination of fluid samples an extremely relevant diagnostic tool.

Symptoms and Types


    Trouble 	breathing
    Muffled 	heart, lung, and abdominal (ventral) sounds
    Abdominal 	enlargement/swelling with fluid build-up
    Large 	scrotum
    Exercise 	intolerance
    Fatigue
    Vomiting


Causes

Exposure to asbestos is one of the known causes for mesothelioma formation.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background health history, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. X-rays of the chest and abdominal cavities will be the most important diagnostic aid for confirming mesothelioma, but radiograph and ultrasound imaging can also be used for observation of effusion or masses that may be present in the cavities of the body, and in the pericardial sac (the lining surrounding the heart).



Your doctor will also take a fluid sample for cytologic (microscopic) examination of the fluid.  Exploratory surgery, or a laparoscopy (surgery of the abdomen) can be performed for removal of mesothelial masses for cellular examination in the laboratory.

Treatment

Most pets can be treated on an outpatient basis. If your cat is having trouble breathing, it should be given a quiet place to rest. Activity, and anything else that might exert or stress your cat should be kept to a minimum. If your cat has an excess of fluid in any of its body cavities as a result of the mesothelioma, such as in the chest or abdomen, your veterinarian will need to hospitalize it for a short period of time in order to drain these cavities. If fluid has collected in the pericardial sac, surgery to relieve the pressure will be required.

Living and Management

Limit your cat's activity until its breathing is easier and no longer of concern. Slow walks close to home and gentle playtimes will be best until your cat has recovered. You will need to provide a safe and quiet space for your pet, away from active children or other animals while it recovers. If your veterinarian has prescribed cisplatin chemotherapy to treat the mesothelioma, you will need to continue to monitor your cat's  progress with frequent follow-up visits in order to test your cat's kidney health, since some animals will have a toxic reaction to the chemotherapy medicine. Your veterinarian will also want to monitor your cat's chest and pleural cavity, using x-ray imaging, to be sure the mesothelioma has not metastasized."," and Types

250,"Meningitis, Meningoencephalitis, Meningomyelitis in Cats","Bacterial Meningitis and other Nervous System Infections in Cats

 

The system of membranes which envelops the cat's central nervous system is called the meninges. If this system becomes inflamed, it is referred to as meningitis. Meningoencephalitis, meanwhile, is the inflammation of the meninges and brain, and meningomyelitis is the inflammation of the meninges and spinal cord.

 

Inflammation of meninges commonly leads to secondary inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord, resulting in various neurological complications. Long-term inflammation can also obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) -- the protective and nourishing fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord -- which leads to accumulation of CSF in the brain and thus severe complications such as seizures and paresis.



Symptoms and Types

 

Neurological symptoms often associated with meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningomyelitis such as impaired movement, altered mental state, and seizures, may be profound and progressive. Other symptoms generally seen in cats suffering from one of these conditions include:

 


	Depression
	Shock
	Low blood pressure
	Fever
	Vomiting
	Abnormal increase in sensitivity to various stimuli (hyperesthesia)


 

Causes

 

The most common cause of meningitis is a bacterial infection in the brain and/or spinal cord originating from elsewhere in the body. Meningoencephalitis, meanwhile, is usually due to infections of the ears, eyes, or nasal cavity. And meningomyelitis generally proceeds following diskospondylitis and osteomyelitis. In kittens and cats with compromised immune system, such infections are commonly reach the brain and spinal cord via the blood.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination and several laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- to help identify and isolate the type of infection.

 

Biochemistry profile, for example, may indicate liver and kidney involvement, while blood testing may reveal an increased number of white blood cells, which is evidence of an ongoing infection. Urinalysis may also reveal pus and bacteria in the cat's urine, an indication of urinary tract infections.

 

Other tools often used to identify the infectious agent involved include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasounds, thoracic and abdominal X-rays, and samples from the skin, eyes, nasal discharge, and sputum.

 

One of the most important diagnostic tests, however, is CSF (or cerebrospinal fluid) analysis. A sample of your cat's CSF will be collected and sent to a laboratory for culturing and further evaluation.

 



Treatment

 

In severe cases of meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or meningomyelitis, the cat will be hospitalized to prevent more severe complications. Once the causative organism is identified, your veterinarian will employ antibiotics intravenously to maximize their effectiveness. Antiepileptic drugs and corticosteroids may also be prescribed to control seizures and reduce inflammation, respectively. Cats that are severely dehydrated, meanwhile, will undergo immediate fluid therapy.

 

Living and Management

 

Rapid and aggressive treatment is vital for a successful outcome, although its effectiveness is highly variable and overall prognosis is not favorable. Unfortunately, many cats die from these type of infections once it reaches the central nervous system, despite treatment.

 

However, if treatment is successful it may take more than four weeks for all the symptoms to subside. The cat's activity should be restricted during this time and until it is stabilized.

 

Prevention

 

Treat your cat’s ear, eyes, and nose infections promptly to avoid spreading of these infections to nervous system."," and Types

 

Neurological symptoms often associated with meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningomyelitis such as impaired movement, altered mental state, and seizures, may be profound and progressive. Other symptoms generally seen in cats suffering from one of these conditions include:

251,Megaesophagus in Cats,"What Is Megaesophagus in Cats?
The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat (pharynx) to the stomach. In cats, most of the esophagus is smooth muscle. However, the last third of the esophagus is made up of striated muscle—the same muscle type found in the arms and legs. These muscles contain nerves that communicate to the brain and send a response back to the muscle telling it to relax or contract.



A sphincter at the beginning of the esophagus remains closed until it receives the signal to open, allow food to pass, and close again. The muscles of the esophagus dilate ahead of the food while simultaneously contracting behind it. This moves the food forward in a process known as peristalsis. The sphincter near the stomach remains closed to protect the esophagus from gastric digestive enzymes—until the signal is received to open and allow the food to enter the stomach. 



Megaesophagus means there is a dilation (stretching) of the diameter of the esophagus and a functional problem with the inability of esophageal muscles to appropriately move liquid and food down into the stomach. This is known as hypomotility. 

Types of Megaesophagus in Cats

Congenital megaesophagus: may be present at birth and due to an underlying medical condition.

Acquired megaesophagus: develops later in life typically due to unknown reasons.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Megaesophagus in Cats
The most common clinical sign of megaesophagus is regurgitation—which differs from vomiting. Regurgitation is a passive response that expels the contents from the esophagus, usually before the food reaches the stomach. Regurgitation can be delayed for several hours, or it can occur shortly after eating. Many times, the regurgitated food can still be seen in a tubular form and appear undigested.



If the megaesophagus is related to a neurological condition, neurological signs like generalized muscle weakness, muscle wasting or atrophy, and pain may be noted. Pet parents may notice that their cat has difficulty breathing (dyspnea), a cough, or a fever, suggesting aspiration pneumonia, a common complication of megaesophagus.

Causes of Megaesophagus in Cats
Megaesophagus is less common in cats than dogs. Siamese cats are predisposed to megaesophagus and frequently also have a gastric emptying disorder. 



Cats can have esophageal obstructions that leads to megaesophagus. Esophageal foreign bodies from hunting (avian or fish bones) or playing (needles, string, fishhooks) are not common in cats, but they could lead to a stricture (narrowing) of the esophagus due to inflammation.



Another obstructive congenital condition that can cause megaesophagus is a vascular ring anomaly. The most common is a persistent right aortic arch (PRAA). This is a complex condition that requires surgery.



Secondary acquired megaesophagus may be related to the following:


	
	An obstruction in the esophagus from a

	
		
		Stricture or a narrowing in a specific area
		
		
		Foreign body
		
		
		Tumor
		
		
		Polyp
		
	
	
	
	A condition associated with the nervous system, such as

	
		
		A disease involving the brain or central nervous system (CNS)
		
		
		A neuromuscular disease (a problem with the stimulation of the nerves) in the esophagus
		
		
		A generalized neuromuscular condition, such as myasthenia gravis
		
		
		Infectious diseases, such as botulism
		
		
		Toxins, such as organophosphates (chemicals found in some flea collars and insecticides) and lead
		
	
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Megaesophagus in Cats
Your vet may initially perform a radiograph or X-ray to diagnose megaesophagus. A radiograph of the thorax (chest) will evaluate the esophagus, while the stomach and intestines will be visible within the abdomen. Your vet may recommend both images to fully evaluate the gastrointestinal system, especially if your cat presents suspected vomiting or regurgitation.



If your vet sees a dilated esophagus on the X-ray, that confirms megaesophagus. However, megaesophagus can be secondary to an underlying medical condition that may not be possible to diagnose via X-ray. Further testing will be needed to determine what caused the megaesophagus and recommend the appropriate treatment. 

Treatment of Megaesophagus in Cats
There is no cure for megaesophagus, it can only be managed. Management of the condition depends on the underlying condition and how long it’s been going on before the problem is addressed. 



Possible treatments include the following:


	
	Cisapride and metoclopramide are motility drugs that are often discussed to manage the hypomotility associated with megaesophagus (help with the movement of muscle). However, due to their action on smooth muscle fibers only, their therapeutic benefits may be questionable as part of the esophagus is also made up of striated muscle.
	
	
	Immunosuppressive drugs are used for conditions like dysautonomia and myasthenia gravis, in addition to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine).
	
	
	Surgery may be recommended if there is a mass or other obstruction, such as a foreign body or vascular ring anomaly, that is contributing to the megaesophagus. Surgery cannot correct a motility problem, however.
	
	
	There are certain cases where veterinarians have recommended a feeding tube to bypass the esophagus if the megaesophagus is temporary and related to another condition, but this is not a long-term solution.
	
	
	Historically, surgery to correct megaesophagus in dogs and cats was not recommended. However, the University of Missouri is evaluating the use of Botox and a specialized ballooning procedure in a specific subset of dogs with megaesophagus.
	


Megaesophagus continues to be an area of veterinary research to help understand the condition, develop new treatment options, better manage the condition, and one day have successful surgical outcomes. 

How Do You Feed a Cat with Megaesophagus?

Megaesophagus requires a large amount of medical care at home. Pet parents must change how they feed their cat by elevating food dishes and keeping pets upright following meals. Special preparation of food can include blending dry or wet food with water into a watery consistency and feeding small, frequent meals throughout the day. 

Recovery and Management of Megaesophagus in Cats
Megaesophagus can often lead to aspiration pneumonia, where food and liquids are inhaled into the lungs that creates a secondary infection. The presence of an aspiration pneumonia indicates a poorer prognosis, as this complicating condition can happen more than once. 



In cases of congenital megaesophagus, symptoms of regurgitation are usually present at the time of weaning, when solid foods are started. Acquired forms are most often found in young to middle-aged adults. The quality and duration of life with megaesophagus depends on the form and underlying condition, as well as the presence of aspiration pneumonia.

"
252,Megacolon in Cats,"What Is Megacolon in Cats?
Yes, you read that word correctly. Megacolon is a chronic condition that occurs most often in cats and is basically a mega-sized, stretched-out, weakened colon.

Megacolon in cats can cause devastating health consequences as the colon fills with old, hardened feces, and the colon is not strong enough to pass the “cemented stool.”

Symptoms of Megacolon in Cats
The most common clinical signs of megacolon in cats include:


	
	Severe, painful constipation
	
	
	Fewer bowel movements
	
	
	Unusually hard feces
	


You may also see watery diarrhea when the liquid stool is forced around a stuck fecal ball or mass.

As megacolon progresses, your cat may:


	
	Lose weight
	
	
	Have less energy
	
	
	Lose their appetite
	
	
	Vomit
	
	
	Have a firm, palpable mass in their abdomen, depending on their body condition
	
	
	Become dehydrated
	


Causes of Megacolon in Cats
The most common cause of feline megacolon is unrelieved or recurrent constipation.

Constipation can be caused by a number of things:


	
	An abnormal narrowing of the pelvis (either congenital or resulting from injury, such as a car injury)
	
	
	Paralysis of the anal region
	
	
	Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases
	
	
	Disease that results in dehydration
	
	
	Physical obstruction (tumors, foreign bodies that get stuck along the intestinal tract, hairballs, and naturally occurring strictures in the colon)
	


With all of these causes, if constipation is not relieved, the distended colon loses normal muscle strength, which exacerbates the constipation.

Another cause of megacolon begins when a cat loses proper nerve function within their colon. This prevents the muscles of the colon wall from functioning properly to pass along stool.

The muscles become stretched, and the colon gets wider. Fecal material accumulates and does not get pushed out, resulting in severe constipation, or worse, obstipation, where the cat stops defecating altogether.

How Vets Diagnose Feline Megacolon
On physical examination, your vet may be able to feel the enlarged colon unless your cat is overweight. Radiographs, or x-rays, of your cat’s abdomen and spine are frequently recommended to look for underlying problems and to assess the degree of constipation.

Radiographs with contrast dye can allow your veterinarian to see the flow of food through the GI tract and thoroughly evaluate the condition. Routine laboratory tests will give a wider picture of your cat’s overall condition, and an abdominal ultrasound may be recommended as well.

Treatment for Megacolon in Cats
Treatment of megacolon in cats depends upon the cause and severity. A medical approach is usually tried first, but surgery may be necessary for severe or chronic cases.

A medical approach involves the use of laxatives, colon-wall stimulants, enemas, and high-fiber diets or low-residue diets. While these don’t correct the underlying cause, they will hopefully allow fecal material to pass so the cat does not become further constipated. If megacolon is caught early, this may be enough to return the cat to normalcy, but there’s a high chance of recurrence.

More severe constipation often requires anesthesia and administration of enemas combined with manual extraction. It may take several attempts to relieve your cat’s constipation.

If the problem continues for months or years, a cat’s colon may eventually stop functioning. Surgical removal of the affected area of the colon is often necessary to return these cats to health.

Recovery and Management of Feline Megacolon
Recovery for cats with megacolon that are treated medically is uncertain and best evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

If muscle function returns and constipation resolves with therapy, the prognosis is fairly bright; however, recurrence is common in many cats. For these patients, pet parents must be diligent in monitoring stool output to prevent severe recurrence. If a cat is otherwise healthy and has a functional colon, they may benefit from targeted or prescription diets and medications.

When the condition has progressed to the point of requiring surgery, the prognosis doesn’t necessarily worsen, but the road to recovery can be longer. The cat will likely have increased bowel movements and loose stools for two to three months following surgery.

If no complications occur after surgery, most cats do quite well. Unfortunately, megacolon seems to be a devastating condition for many young kittens who develop the condition.
Megacolon in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with megacolon?There is no expiration date attached to a diagnosis of megacolon, but the disease is serious and should never be ignored. Early intervention is the key with megacolon in cats. If you see the symptoms and go to the vet early on, your cat can go on to lead a basically normal life.
Can cat megacolon be cured?Treatment of megacolon in cats depends upon the extent and severity of the condition. The longer it continues, the more aggressive the treatment must be. Chronic treatment may be required in any case.
How does a cat get megacolon?Under normal circumstances, the colon or large intestines absorb water and store fecal material. When the movement of feces is delayed and feces remains in the colon for prolonged periods, the colon continues to absorb water from the feces.

This causes the delayed stool to dry out and harden, making it more difficult to pass. This can lead to more feces piling up, which stretches the colon out, and the cycle becomes harder to break as the stool is harder to pass.

253,Maternal Behavior Problems in Female Cats,"Mismothering in Female Cats
 
Maternal behavioral problems are classified as either the lack of maternal behavior when dealing with the mother's own young or excessive maternal behavior in the absence of newborn kittens. (Other types of maternal behavior problem also exist, but they are still poorly defined.)

Symptoms and Types

Inadequate Maternal Behavior 

    Abandons her own newborn pups 	(most common after caesarean section)
    Does not allow her offspring to 	nurse
    Insufficient cleaning of the young
    Inadequate retrieval of the young
    Failure to stimulate elimination
    Attacking and/or killing some or 	all of the newborn, especially if it has a different odor or 	appearance
    If disturbed by people or other 	animals, may redirect her aggression to her young


Excessive Maternal Behavior 

    Un-bred mother may attempt to 	nurse unfamiliar pups
    Guarding of inanimate objects such 	as stuffed animals
    An increase in the size of mammary 	glands


Causes

The lack of maternal behavior shown by mothers with newborn pups, especially after caesarean section, has been attributed to gradual decrease in oxytocin, which is important during the sensitive period of acceptance of dam’s own neonates. Conversely, when there is an absence of newborns, excessive maternal behavior is due to the increased progesterone levels resulting from estrus in un-bred queens, followed by an immediate and sharp decline in the progesterone levels.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- though the results are usually normal unless a disease is present.



Treatment

Medical treatment may be required in some females, but proper care and management typically help in resolving such behavioral problems. Spaying should be delayed for at least four months after estrus to avoid abnormal behavior. That being said, spaying has been suggested to help in preventing future excessive maternal behavior.

Living and Management

In case of lack of maternal behavior the queen should be fed freely to encourage lactation and meet her energy demands. Nursing females should also be placed in quiet, comfortable, and dark area, where she will not be disturbed by other people and animals. If the queen is seen biting her neonates, she may require a muzzle or may need to be removed from the room. If aggression persists, the separation can be done for several weeks until aggression subsides.

Conversely, in case of excessive maternal behavior, the queen should be separated from the stolen puppies and their actual mother. Moreover, the mothered objects like stuffed animals should be removed from the environment of the queen. In these females, food intake should be restricted for few days to prevent lactation.

Many experts recommend against breeding queens with a history of maternal behavioral problems, as these problems are shown in subsequent pregnancies."," and Types

254,Mastitis in Cats,"What Is Mastitis in Cats?
Mastitis is an inflammation or swelling of a mammary gland, and is a condition usually linked to a bacterial infection. Mastitis can affect just one mammary gland, but female cats typically have eight of them and more than one can be involved.

Mastitis isn’t all that common in cats, but when it does occur, it’s most often seen in female cats who are nursing kittens or who have just stopped. Without treatment, cats with mastitis can become very sick and even die, but thankfully, most respond well to the correct antibiotics and recover quickly.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Mastitis in Cats
When mammary glands are inflamed, they may be:


	
	Warm to the touch
	
	
	Red
	
	
	Swollen
	
	
	Firmer than normal
	
	
	Painful
	


The milk that comes out of the nipple can be unusually thick and contain visible blood or pus. In severe cases, the skin over the gland may become dark and ulcerated (having an open sore). If an infection has led to an abscess (a pocket of pus), it can burst, and you may notice drainage of blood and pus from a wound on the skin.

At first, cats with mastitis may not seem to feel sick, but systemic signs of infection often develop with time. These may include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	


Because mastitis is painful, cats may not want to nurse, which can lead to poor weight gain in their kittens.

Causes of Mastitis in Cats
Most cases of mastitis develop after bacteria in the environment make their way up the teat canal, causing an infection in the mammary gland. Certain situations make this more likely, including:


	
	Damp and dirty surroundings—The more bacteria that are present in a cat’s surroundings, the greater the chances of infection. Keeping a nursing cat’s environment clean and dry can help prevent mastitis.
	
	
	Trauma—Tissue damage to a teat or other parts of a mammary gland can give bacteria a way into deeper tissues.
	
	
	Milk collecting in the mammary glands—The normal flow of milk through and out of a mammary gland removes bacteria and helps prevent infection. Milk can back up in mammary glands (a condition called galactostasis) when a litter of kittens stops nursing abruptly or because of anatomic abnormalities.
	
	
	Mammary hyperplasia—This is a condition that may be confused with or lead to mastitis. After a cat ovulates (whether she becomes pregnant or not), her ovaries produce progesterone. Sometimes, this leads to her mammary glands becoming unusually large. The skin over them can become damaged, which may lead to infection.
	
	
	Mammary cancer—Infections can develop in and around tumors when a cat has mammary cancer.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Mastitis in Cats
A veterinarian can usually diagnose mastitis based on finding signs of infection in one or more mammary glands in a cat who is or has recently been nursing kittens. The veterinarian may look at a sample of milk under the microscope to confirm infection.

However, it’s important to know what bacteria are involved and which antibiotics are most likely to be effective. A culture and sensitivity test done on a milk sample will usually provide this information. It may also be necessary to run bloodwork to see how severely affected a cat is and do tissue biopsies to rule out other conditions.

Antibiotics for treatment are only available by prescription, so a veterinary visit is needed. But pet parents are often taking care of a mother and a whole litter of kittens. Should you separate them or bring them all to the clinic together? The answer depends on a variety of factors, including how sick the mother is, the age of the kittens, how long they would be kept apart, and how difficult transportation will be.

Ask your veterinarian what you should do when you are making your appointment. And while you’re at it, see if they’d be willing to make a house call or refer you to another veterinarian who could. This is the perfect situation for the doctor to come to the patient.

Treatment for Mastitis in Cats
A veterinarian will first pick an antibiotic that is likely to work well based on the specifics of a cat’s case, but they may make a change when results of the culture and sensitivity test are available.

Commonly prescribed antibiotics for mastitis include:


	
	Trimethoprim sulfa
	
	
	Clindamycin
	
	
	Amoxicillin
	
	
	Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
	
	
	Cephalexin
	
	
	Cefoxitin
	


Pain relief (buprenorphine, for example) and supportive care may also be needed. Surgery to remove severely damaged tissues (due to a large, ruptured abscess, for example) is also sometimes necessary.

One question that often comes up is whether to let kittens continue nursing after their mom has been diagnosed with mastitis. If they are ready to be weaned, it may be easiest to go ahead and do it now. If not, nursing will keep the milk flowing and can help get bacteria out of the mammary glands. But this is only an option if the mother isn’t too severely affected, will allow the kittens to nurse, and can be put on medications that are safe for the kittens too.

Recovery and Management for Mastitis in Cats
Unless the cat needs surgery or is very sick, they can usually be treated for mastitis at home. Your veterinarian will go over how to give your cat the medications they have prescribed and any other treatments they recommend. Applying warm or cool compresses (or cabbage leaves) can help relieve swelling and discomfort.

In most cases, cats with mastitis will need to be given antibiotics for two to three weeks, but their condition should start improving within just a few days of starting treatment. Call your veterinarian for advice if there’s no improvement or if your cat’s condition gets worse at any time.

Once your cat has recovered, it’s time to consider having her spayed. Spaying is the best form of prevention, since most cases of mastitis in cats are connected to lactation (nursing).
Mastitis in CatsWhy does my spayed cat have swollen nipples?The nipples of spayed cats are usually small and don’t change much from day to day or month to month. A veterinary examination is needed if a spayed cat’s nipples become swollen. Possible causes include a piece of an ovary being left behind during a spay, hormone exposure through medications, tumors that produce hormones, or mammary cancer.
Why is my cat’s nipple bleeding?Bleeding from a nipple can be a sign of trauma, mastitis, mammary cancer, or other potentially serious health problems. Unless the problem is minor and easily managed at home (a small abrasion or scrape, for example), a cat with a bleeding nipple should be seen by a veterinarian.

255,Mast Cell Tumors in Cats,"What Are Mast Cell Tumors in Cats?
Mast cells are a type of white blood cell present throughout the body, including the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive tract. These cells contain histamine, a chemical compound that plays an important role in the immune system’s defense against perceived allergens.

When a mast cell is exposed to an allergen, it goes through a process called degranulation and releases histamine, which—to remove the allergen from the body—causes allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and a runny nose and/or eyes. When histamine is released in excessive amounts, however, it can cause anaphylaxis—a life-threatening allergic reaction.

A mast cell tumor (MCT), is a type of tumor that arises from the rapid replication and division of mast cells in the tissue. Mast cell tumors can grow slowly over time, or develop very rapidly, seemingly overnight.

Mast cell tumors in cats are found on the skin (cutaneous MCTs) in most cases, typically appearing on the head and neck—but can appear anywhere on the body. These are the second most common type of skin tumor to develop in cats. Mast cell tumors can also develop on the spleen (visceral or splenic MCTs) and within the intestinal tract (intestinal MCTs), typically the small intestines.

Are Mast Cell Tumors Cancerous?

Tumors can be benign or malignant:


	
	A benign tumor or growth is non-cancerous and does not invade surrounding tissues, or spread to other parts of the body. These lesions are typically slow growing and have an favorable prognosis, overall.
	
	
	A malignant tumor or growth is cancerous and comprised of abnormal cells that tend to divide rapidly. These cells invade the surrounding tissues readily. Its spread to other areas of the body can also occur via the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Malignant tumors tend to be aggressive and generally have a poor long-term prognosis.
	


Mast cell tumors in cats can be benign or malignant depending on the characteristics of the cells present and where they are located. For example, mast cell tumors on the skin tend to be benign, while mast cell tumors affecting the internal organs are more likely to be malignant.

Symptoms of Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
Clinical signs and symptoms can vary depending on where the mast cell tumor is located and how aggressive (if malignant) the tumor is. Mast cell tumors on the spleen, or within the intestinal tract, will be more likely to cause systemic (whole-body) signs:


	
	Cutaneous:

	
		
		Hard, hairless, flattened bumps (plaques) located commonly on the head and neck, but can develop anywhere on the body
		
		
		Small lumps (nodules) that feel very firm within the skin
		
		
		Excessive itchiness and associated hair loss
		
		
		Ulceration (an open sore)
		
	
	
	
	Splenic or visceral:

	
		
		Vomiting
		
		
		Weight loss
		
		
		Poor appetite
		
	
	
	
	Intestinal:

	
		
		Vomiting and diarrhea
		
		
		Fresh blood in the stool
		
		
		Black or tarry stool, indicating digested blood
		
	
	


Causes of Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
While the exact cause of mast cell tumors is not fully known, both genetics and environmental factors are suspected to play a role. For example, Siamese cats tend to be prone to the development of cutaneous mast cell tumors.

In dogs, there is a mutation present in a specific gene, referred to as KIT, that’s associated with the development of mast cell tumors. The KIT protein plays a role in cell replication and division. A mutation in the KIT has also been detected in cats with mast cell tumors.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
Mast cell tumors can be diagnosed by a procedure called a fine needle aspiration (FNA). A sterile needle is inserted into the tumor and a sample of the cell is retrieved using a syringe. Your veterinarian, or a veterinary pathologist, will then examine the cells under a microscope called cytology. Mast cells have a distinct appearance and abnormalities are typically easily diagnosed via cytology.

In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a biopsy of the tumor. A sample of tissue from the tumor, or the entire tumor, can be removed and submitted for histopathology review by a veterinary pathologist. The histopathology report will provide your veterinarian with a more detailed description of the cells present within the tumor. This will help determine the type of tumor, how aggressive it is, and if clean surgical margins are possible. Clean surgical margins means that no cancer cells are still present on the outer edges of the tissue when surgically removed. This is the main goal when excising a tumor to prevent recurrence of growth.

If systemic illness is present or a malignant type of mast cell tumor is suspected or confirmed, your veterinarian may also recommend additional diagnostics, such as lab work (i.e., bloodwork, urinalysis) and imaging of the chest and abdomen. This will help determine the stage of the disease process, plan the most appropriate treatment protocol, and gauge your pet’s overall prognosis.

Treatment of Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
The recommended treatment protocol will depend on where the MCT is located and how invasive the tumor is. The choice of treatment for cutaneous mast cell tumors is surgical removal.

Complete surgical removal of splenic and intestinal mast cell tumors may not be obtainable and cancerous cells can be left behind. Sometimes cutaneous mast cell tumors in cats can spread to other areas of the body, though unusual. Alternative treatment options may be recommended in these cases, such as chemotherapy or radiation. This will likely require a referral to a veterinary oncologist.

When pierced or ruptured (as by aspiration or surgery), all mast cell tumors can cause systemic symptoms in your pet due to the release of histamine, and therefore your veterinarian will likely prescribe medications to avoid any negative side effects during treatment. Antihistamines, antacids, anti-nausea, and pain medications are common examples.

Recovery and Management of Mast Cell Tumors in Cats
Most cats with cutaneous mast cell tumors will go on to live healthy, normal lives. Recurrence of cutaneous mast cell tumors can happen, but it is rare and generally occurs when inadequate (non-clean) surgical margins were obtained.

Cats that develop splenic or intestinal mast cell tumors typically have a poor long-term prognosis since these types tend to be malignant and spread to other areas of the body more readily. Daily medications to help manage systemic illness, and improve quality of life, may also be recommended in these cases.

If your pet is diagnosed with a MCT, surgery will likely be recommended as a treatment option, and it is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions once your pet is discharged. An E-collar (recovery cone) will likely be needed to prevent any self-trauma or injury to the surgical site while your pet is healing post-operatively.

It is also important to keep the surgical site clean and dry, and to limit your pet’s activity for at least 10-14 days to prevent dehiscence (opening of the wound). If you have any concerns while your pet is recovering at home, promptly contact your veterinary clinic.

256,Mass Protrusion from the Vaginal Area in Cats,"Vaginal Hyperplasia and Prolapse in Cats

A mass protruding from a cat's vaginal area is referred to as vaginal hyperplasia and prolapse. The condition is similar in nature to fluid-filled tissue (edema). If serious, it can prevent normal urination. Vaginal hyperplasia affects cats all ages, although it is found more commonly in younger animals. The outcome is positive for most cats, but the chance of the condition recurring is high.

Vaginal hyperplasia and prolapse can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types

There are several signs that may be noticed with this medical disorder, including the licking of the vaginal area, unwillingness to copulate, and painful urination (dysuria).

Type 1 hyperplasia occurs when there is a slight protrusion of the mass, even though it does not exit the vulva itself. Type 2 hyperplasia, on the other hand, is when the vaginal tissue actually protrudes through the vulvar opening. Type 3 hyperplasia refers to the donut-shaped mass which can be seen externally.

Diagnosis

Upon physical examination, a round mass may be noticed protruding the cat's vulvar area. A vaginal examination will be performed to determine the severity and type of the condition. The cat's tissue may feel dry to the touch.

Treatment

Treatment is typically done on an outpatient basis. If there is a protruding mass, it is important to keep the area clean and watch for problems urinating, as they are common. The recurrence rate of vaginal hyperplasia following treatment is high (66-100%).

Living and Management

If your cat is unable to urinate, this is a sign of a serious medical condition and should be treated immediately, as there may be complications with the cat's urethra.

Prevention

There are currently no prevention methods for this medical condition."," and Types

257,Masculinizing Sex Hormone Deficiency in Cats,"Hypoandrogenism in Cats
 


Hypoandrogenism refers to the relative or absolute deficiency of  masculinizing sex hormones, such as testosterone and its by-products.  Also known as androgens, these hormones are produced by the adrenal  cortex -- part of the adrenal glands, which are located above each  kidney -- and by the ovaries in the female, and the testes in the male. There are two subtypes of the condition: primary and secondary.
 
Primary hypoandrogenism in the male is a rare condition associated with bilaterally symmetric hair loss in older castrated male cats. It may be seen in association with testicular destruction in association with inflammatory testicular disease; however, the latter is not usually associated with clinical signs other than a lack of libido and spermatogenesis. Primary hypoandrogenism is also documented in females, but is rare.

Conversely, secondary hypoandrogenism is due to such conditions as hyperadrenocorticism (an endocrine disorder) and hypothyroidism, and is far more common. Although congenital forms exist as well, it is more common in older animals. In some cases, symptoms may begin to appear around puberty in the form of behavioral or anatomic abnormalities.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Failure to cycle
    Low libido
    Dry, dull hair coat
    Coat color change
    Small, underdeveloped testes
    Absence of penile spines in cats
    Poor semen quality
    Infertility
    Incontinence
    Lack of body growth, cat is smaller than expected for its breed type

 
Causes


    Administration of steroid compounds
    Testicular degeneration
    Castration
    Pituitary tumor
    Failure of testes to descend (cryptorchidism)

 
In addition, Calico and tortoiseshell male cats are predisposed, occurs in  association with Klinefelter's (39 XXY) syndrome (affected males have an  extra X sex chromosome).

  

Diagnosis
 
A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis as well as a number of other tests to identify the underlying cause such as hypothyroidism. For example, your doctor will want to know how the thyroid is functioning. The physical exam and the history you provide will also be helpful. will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. If there has been hair loss your doctor may also perform a skin biopsy, and a testicular biopsy can be useful for determining whether there is an inflammatory testicular disease.
 
Treatment
 
Treatment will depend on the underlying cause, but your veterinarian may attempt hormone replacement therapy to see if it raises the androgen levels.
 
Prevention
 
If your cat is to be used for breeding, avoid drugs that are known to cause hypoandrogenism (e.g., steroid compounds).
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will ask you to keep track of any responses you see to the prescribed therapy, and will schedule follow up visits in order to conduct periodic tests to look for clinical signs that the treatment plan is working."," and Types

258,Manx Syndrome in Cats,"What is Manx Syndrome in Cats?
Manx syndrome is a collection of problems that can affect tailless cats. Cats with Manx syndrome—also called sacrocaudal dysgenesis or spina bifida—may have issues with their hind end.

These troubles are the result of poor formation of the bottom portion of their spine (backbone) and spinal cord, the bundle of nerves carrying messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Problems in development in the lowest portion of the spine or spinal cord can result in difficulty walking or challenges with bladder and bowel control. The spinal cord runs through a canal that is protected by the vertebrae (small bones forming the backbone) that make up the spine. The tail is a continuation of the spine.

Affected cats can have a slight wobble of the back legs and rump. They may have weakness in their rump and even develop hind limb paralysis in extreme cases. Sometimes these issues are severe. Manx kittens may die in utero or shortly after birth if affected. However, these abnormalities can be less severe and are more manageable.

Manx cats have a genetic mutation often resulting in a shortened or absent tail, and thus, a shorter spine. Because this genetic mutation is so prevalent in the Manx cat breed, the syndrome is named after them.

Symptoms of Manx Syndrome in Cats
A few common symptoms of Manx syndrome are:


	
	Lack of tail
	
	
	Weakness in the rear end
	
	
	Wobbly gait when walking
	
	
	Constipation
	
	
	Fecal incontinence
	
	
	Urinary incontinence
	
	
	Frequent urinary tract infections
	
	
	Lack of feeling in the back legs or around the anus and genitals
	
	
	Paralysis of one or both back legs
	
	
	Inability to jump onto high surfaces
	


Causes of Manx Syndrome in Cats
Manx syndrome is a genetic disease, meaning that a cat inherits the disease from their parents. Unless a cat has a history of tail trauma, tailless cats often have a genetic mutation. Any breed of tailless cat can be affected by sacrocaudal dysgenesis; however, it’s much more common in the Manx breed than others.

The Manx breed is one of the oldest known cat breeds. Manx cats can come in several varieties classified on the length of their tail. The main classifications are:


	
	Rumpy, with no tail
	
	
	Rumpy riser, a very small tail nub that sticks up
	
	
	Stumpy, a shortened tail
	
	
	Longy, a nearly full-length tail
	
	
	Full tailed, a normal tail length
	


This tail mutation is a highly dominant gene, meaning that when tailless cats breed, they have kittens that carry their tailless gene. When a cat with no tail is bred with a cat with a full tail, their kittens may have no tail, a shortened tail, or a long tail.

If two cats without a tail are bred together, they may have very serious shortening of the spine. They may also develop spinal deformities that can lead to the most severe form of Manx syndrome. Kittens that are born from these types of cats often do not survive or may need to be humanely euthanized.

For these reasons, Rumpies shouldn’t be bred together.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Manx Syndrome in Cats
Manx syndrome is typically diagnosed when cats are young, usually once kittens begin to walk. A vet will go through a cat's health and family history and then perform a physical exam. Several tests will be recommended to rule out other diseases that can look similar.

Your veterinarian may recommend X-rays of your cat's hind legs and spine. A neurological exam may be done. Severely affected cats may be tested for other neurologic diseases that can look like Manx syndrome. A urinalysis (an exam of the urine to test for disease) or urine culture (a test for the presence of bacteria in the urine) may also be recommended.

Treatment of Manx Syndrome in Cats
There’s no cure for Manx syndrome. However, it can be managed with proper care, such as good hygiene and keeping your cat comfortable.

If your cat is unable to urinate on their own, your veterinarian may teach you how to help your cat relieve their bladder. Stool softeners may also be prescribed to manage constipation.

It’s very important that you keep your tailless cat clean. It’s not uncommon for cats with Manx syndrome to have urine or feces that gets stuck on their backside due to the shortened or absent tail and nerve sensations in the area.

If this stool or urine is left on the skin, it can lead to secondary skin and urinary tract infections. Diapers may be helpful to put on cats with poor fecal control to avoid accidents in the house. If so, it’s important that they be changed regularly to avoid diaper rash.

Recovery and Management of Manx Syndrome in Cats
There’s no specific treatment or surgery for Manx syndrome, which is a lifelong condition. Cats may be so severely affected that it’s impossible for them to maintain a good quality of life. For these cats, humane euthanasia may be recommended.

Often, cats aren’t as severely affected and can have an excellent quality of life with a few changes to their environment and extra care given to their personal hygiene. Sanitary wipes, like Douxo Antiseptic wipes, may be helpful in keeping your cat’s backside clean.

All cats—especially cats with Manx syndrome—should remain indoors due to high safety risks. Not being able to jump and run to get away from dogs, cars, and other dangers would make outdoor life unsafe.

If you have hardwood floors, it may be helpful to install runners or lay down no-slip rugs to give your cat traction and a better grip if they are wobbly when they walk.

Jumping can be a challenge and may not be possible for affected cats. Be sure to lower your cat’s houses and beds. A ramp to a window seat makes a perfect addition to your cat’s home.

Prevention of Manx Syndrome in Cats
Manx syndrome can only be prevented with responsible breeding. If two tailless cats are bred together, they are at an increased likelihood of developing severe Manx syndrome.
Manx Syndrome in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with Manx syndrome?Cats with Manx syndrome have varying lifespans, depending on the severity of their condition. Cats that are mildly affected can live long, happy lives with minimal issues when supportive care is given.

Cats with severe Manx syndrome may have short lifespans due to secondary conditions, such as chronic urinary tract infections, skin infections, trouble with their bowel movements, and poor mobility.

259,Mange in Cats,"What Is Mange in Cats?
When you hear the word mange you probably think of dogs, but cats can suffer from the hair loss, itching, and skin damage caused by mange too. In fact, there are three common types of cat mange, each caused by different parasitic mites.

Mange isn’t a frequent problem in cats, but it needs to be considered if more common causes of skin problems—like fleas—have been ruled out.

Mange is rarely a medical emergency, but cats should be seen by a veterinarian right away if they have signs of systemic illness like lethargy, weakness, or a poor appetite.

Types of Mange in Cats

There are three main types of mange in cats:


	
	Demodectic mange (demodicosis)—Two species of Demodex mites (D. cati that live inside hair follicles and D. gatoi that live on the surface of the skin) can cause problems for cats.
	
	
	Notoedric mange—Notoedres cati mites cause notoedric mange, which is also sometimes called feline scabies.
	
	
	Cheyletiellosis—A bigger mite, Cheyletiella blakei, is responsible for a condition in cats called cheyletiellosis, also known as walking dandruff.
	


Occasionally, other types of mange mites can lead to skin problems in cats, including the ear mite Otodectes cynotis, as well as Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes sarcoptic mange in dogs.

Symptoms of Mange in Cats
As you can imagine, mange mites that crawl on or burrow into a cat’s skin create a lot of discomfort.

Symptoms of mange in cats can include:


	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Itching
	
	
	Skin lesions such as:

	
		
		Rashes
		
		
		Sores
		
		
		Miliary dermatitis (small, crusty bumps)
		
		
		Eosinophilic granuloma complex (patches of raised, red, and oozy skin)
		
	
	
	
	Hair pulling, especially on the abdomen when caused by D. gatoi
	
	
	Chin acne or other skin problems primarily affecting the chin (D. cati)
	
	
	Crusty skin, especially around the head and neck (notoedric mange)
	
	
	Skin flakes that might move (cheyletiellosis)
	


These symptoms aren’t specific to mange in cats. Other conditions, such as fleas, skin infections, allergies, and ringworm can also be to blame.

Causes of Mange in Cats 
Most of the time, a cat will get mange because they came in contact with another cat who is carrying mange mites on their skin. The mites can also survive off a host for a while, so they may be spread through infested environments or objects, such as brushes.

In contrast, D. cati mites are not contagious; they are a normal part of the microbiome that lives on a cat’s skin. But they may become a problem when their population becomes too large, which can happen if a cat’s immune system is suppressed because of disease, age, or medications.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Mange in Cats
The first step in diagnosing mange in cats is for a veterinarian to do a physical exam and learn about your cat’s lifestyle and health history. Have answers to these questions ready before your appointment.


	
	Has your cat been outdoors?
	
	
	Are there other animals in your home, and are any of them (or you) also having skin problems?
	
	
	Has your cat been sick recently, or do they have a chronic health problem?
	
	
	What medications or supplements are you giving your cat?
	


Next, your veterinarian will probably take samples from your cat’s skin so they can search for mites under the microscope. They may press a piece of clear tape against your cat’s skin or lightly scrape it with a scalpel blade.

Other diagnostic tests can include fecal exams, flea combing, and blood work to look for underlying health problems. Sometimes a veterinarian will recommend treating mange even if they didn’t see mites during the diagnostic workup because some types of mites are hard to find.

Treatment of Mange in Cats
Many treatments for cat mange are available. The best choice will depend on your cat’s age and health status and the type of mange that they have. Options include:


	
	Moxidectin (Advantage Multi®)
	
	
	Fluralaner (Bravecto® topical)
	
	
	Lime sulfur dips
	
	
	Amitraz dips
	
	
	Ivermectin (Heartgard®)
	
	
	Milbemycin (Interceptor®)
	
	
	Fipronil (Frontline®)
	
	
	Selamectin (Revolution®)
	


Most of these treatments need a veterinarian’s prescription and may need to be given at dosages that are different than what is printed on the label.

Never give your cat any treatment for mange without speaking to your veterinarian first.

Recovery and Management of Mange in Cats
Cats with mange will usually start to get better within a week or so of starting the right treatment. First, their itchiness should improve, but it can take longer for their skin to heal and fur to grow back. In severe cases, cats may also need medications to control itching or treat secondary skin infections.

You may also need to treat other animals in your home because they could be carrying the mites on their skin even if they seem healthy. These asymptomatic carriers can be a source of treatment failure and reoccurring problems with mange.

Talk to your veterinarian if your cat’s symptoms get worse after starting treatment or don’t improve as expected.

Prevention of Mange in Cats
Cheyletiellosis, notoedric mange, and demodicosis caused by D. gatoi are all contagious, so the best way to prevent them is to keep your cats inside, away from other cats who might be carriers.

If your cat must go outdoors, many of the products used to treat mange (Bravecto® and Advantage Multi®, for example) can help prevent the condition and are also effective against other external parasites, like fleas.

However, demodicosis caused by D. cati is not contagious. Severe cases usually happen with immunosuppression. Therefore, the best way to prevent this type of mange is to keep your cat as healthy as possible, provide them with excellent nutrition, avoid the use of immunosuppressive medications whenever possible, and see your veterinarian right away if problems arise.
Mange in Cats FAQsIs mange in cats contagious to humans?Notoedric mange and cheyletiellosis (but not demodicosis) can be contagious to people. Talk to your physician if you think there is any chance that you could have gotten mange from your cat.
What does a cat with mange look like?The most common symptoms of mange in cats are itchiness, hair loss, and skin lesions. Of course, signs like these are also seen with many other health problems, including allergies, skin infections, fleas, and ringworm.
Can a cat survive mange? Most cats will recover quickly from mange and will not have any long-lasting effects. However, mange (especially severe cases of notoedric mange) can be fatal if a cat does not get proper treatment.

260,Mammary Gland Enlargement in Cats,"Mammary Gland Hyperplasia in Cats

Mammary gland hyperplasia is a benign condition in which an an excessive amount of tissue grows, resulting in enlarged masses in the mammary glands. This is primarily limited to young, sexually intact, cycling, or pregnant queens, but it can also affect cats of either gender after neutering, and cats of either gender that are on progestogen medication.

Symptoms and Types


    Enlargement of one or more mammary glands
    Firm, nonpainful masses in the chest, and abdominal area


Causes


    Secondary to a progesterone influence
    May develop after neutering; the illness may involve progesterone, growth hormone, or prolactin (a peptide hormone  primarily associated with lactation)
    High progesterone – may be associated with false pregnancy in a queen that has been induced to ovulate but has remained nonpregnant for 40–50 days after ovulation induction, or in pregnant queens throughout the gestation period
    Associated with administration of prescription progestogen


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need to differentiate between several possibilities to arrive at a reliable diagnosis. Fluid will be expressed from the mammary gland for laboratory analysis, and a biopsy of the tissue may also be analyzed to determine the exact cause of the excessive tissue growth, and whether the growth is in fact, of a benign or malignant (cancerous) nature. Mastitis (infection of the mammary glands) can usually be ruled out based on the absence of symptoms, such as painful glands and  fever, but the presence or absence of bacteria in the expressed fluid will definitively rule out infection.



Treatment

If the enlargement is due to high levels of progesterone, the mass will  diminish as the levels fall at the end of the false pregnancy or gestation. To lower progesterone levels permanently, a hysterectomy may be considered if fertility is not an issue. If the enlargement is related to the use of prescription progestogens, the mass will diminish when the medication is withdrawn.

Enlargement that occurs after neutering will resolve itself spontaneously. If your cat is uncomfortable, your veterinarian may prescribe progesterone receptor blockers, or prolactin inhibitors (a peptide hormone that is primarily associated with lactation).

Living and Management

The likelihood of recurrence in cats that are left intact is unknown, as is any correlation with other abnormal conditions of the reproductive tract."," and Types

261,Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats,"What Is Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats?
Malignant hyperthermia, often triggered by a stressful event, is a dysregulation of calcium in the body that causes sustained muscle contraction, seen as stiffness in muscle groups such as in the arms and legs.  It is much more common in pigs than in cats, but when it does occur it is a life-threatening condition and a medical emergency.

In cases of malignant hyperthermia, the cells’ energy stores become depleted, leading to an increase in oxygen demand and the production of heat often exceeding temperatures well above that of normal (100.5-102.5 F). This leads to cell death and the subsequent release of cell contents such as potassium into the blood. These elevated potassium levels can cause cardiac arrest and death. 

Symptoms of Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
Most cases of malignant hyperthermia in cats occur under anesthesia; therefore, you as the pet parent won’t be present to see the signs. However, as malignant hyperthermia has also occurred during times of stress or exercise, it’s important to be aware of what to look out for and when to seek medical attention.

Common signs are:


	
	Tachycardia (higher than normal heart rate)
	
	
	Tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing)
	
	
	Fever, often reaching >106 F
	
	
	Muscle rigidity
	
	
	Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
	
	
	Irregular blood pressure
	


Causes of Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
In people, malignant hyperthermia is an inheritable disease—this has also been shown in animals, although it can occur sporadically. For animals that are susceptible, triggering events such as excitement, exercise, stress, and inhalant anesthetic gases are the main causes. Medications such as succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocking agent, have also been shown to cause malignant hyperthermia.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
As testing is extremely limited and somewhat invasive (requiring muscle biopsy), a diagnosis is usually made when there are signs of malignant hyperthermia correlative to anesthesia or a stressful event. Unfortunately, the available tests do not offer rapid diagnosis in a crisis. Some supportive laboratory evidence in addition to the above symptoms includes:


	
	Electrolyte abnormalities
	
	
	Increased kidney values (BUN, CREA)
	
	
	Increased CK, a muscle enzyme
	
	
	Impaired clotting ability (increases in PT/PTT)
	
	
	Myoglobinuria (brown-colored urine due to muscle breakdown)
	


If your cat has survived a prior episode of malignant hyperthermia or has a known family member with the condition, it is extremely important that you share that information with your veterinarian, as certain precautions can and should be taken if your cat requires anesthesia.

Treatment of Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
As noted, malignant hyperthermia is a true medical emergency. Any anesthesia being administered should be discontinued immediately and 100% oxygen should be given to the cat.

Supportive care measures with antiarrhythmics, ventilation, IV fluids, and external cooling measures with ice packs and fans are often required. Dantrolene, a muscle relaxant, is often administered as well.

Recovery and Management of Malignant Hyperthermia in Cats
Unfortunately, the prognosis for malignant hyperthermia is usually fatal, but for cats that survive or for those where detection and treatment occurred early on, the prognosis varies depending on the degree of severity of the episode and the resulting side effects. For example, a body temperature of >106 F can cause cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) and an increase in blood clotting, so even if your cat survives, there may be significant long-term damage in which quality of life would need to be considered.

262,Magnesium Deficiency in Cats,"Hypomagnesemia in Cats

Hypomagnesium is a clinical disorder in which the body is suffering from a deficiency in magnesium. Magnesium is second only to potassium as the most abundant substance in the cells. Most is found in the bone (60 percent) and soft tissue (38 percent), and most of the soft tissue magnesium resides in the skeletal muscle and liver. Magnesium is required for many metabolic functions, it is an activator or catalyst for more than 300 enzyme systems, including enzymes that involve adenose triphosphat (ATP), which transports chemical energy within the cells for metabolism.

Magnesium is an important cofactor in maintaining an electrical balance across membranes, and is also important in the production and elimination of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter); a low concentration of magnesium in the extracellular fluid (fluid outside of the cells) can increase concentrations of acetylcholine at motor endplates, resulting in an involuntary reaction of muscles. Interference with the electrical gradient can result in neuromuscular and cardiac abnormalities.

Some of the complications that can occur with hypomagnesemia are alterations of the functions of the skeletal muscles, resulting in tetany (severe muscular pain) and a variety of myopathies (diseases of skeletal muscles); ventricular heart arrhythmias, or torsades de pointes (a tachycardia, or fast heart rhythm that originates in one of the ventricles of the heart), and depolarization of cardiac cells and tachyarrhythmias (fast heart rhythms); resistance to the effects of parathyroid syndrome; an increase in the uptake of calcium into bone; and an increase in the risk of digoxin (digitalis) toxicity.

Symptoms


    Weakness
    Muscle trembling
    Ataxia (muscle incoordination)
    Depression
    Hyperreflexia (overactive reflexes)
    Tetany (severe muscle pain)
    Behavioral changes
    Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)


Causes


    Severe malnutrition or significant malabsorptive intestinal diseases
    Nephrotoxic drugs (drugs that are poisonous to the kidneys)
    Diabetes mellitus
    Use of diuretics (drugs to rid the body of excess fluid)
    Excessive calcium excretion through urination
    Decreased intake of magnesium, may occur due to lack of magnesium in parenteral (intravenous or injected) fluids in patients receiving long-term fluid therapy or dialysis


Diagnosis

Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Signs of hypomagnesemia are typically vague and affect one or more body systems. Therefore, other causes of neuromuscular abnormalities, and especially other electrolyte abnormalities, must be investigated. During the physical examination, your doctor will be looking for cardiac abnormalities, intoxications related to drugs/medications, and kidney diseases, any of which can lead to some of the symptoms described above.


An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), a common side effect of hypomagnesemia.

Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the abnormality and the severity of the hypomagnesemia. Because severe hypomagnesemia can be fatal, prompt and appropriate treatment is essential. Mild hypomagnesemia may resolve with treatment of the underlying disorder; however, if hypomagnesemia is severe, intensive care will be needed.

If digoxin is being prescribed, its use will have to be discontinued, if possible, until the hypomagnesemia has been resolved, and diuretics will need to be used with caution, or another form of fluid removal prescribed. In addition, it must be kept in mind that hpermagnesemia – too much magnesium in the body – is possible with overzealous treatment.

Living and Management

Initially, your veterinarian will want to check your cat's magnesium and calcium concentrations on a daily basis. During magnesium infusions, your doctor will also want to administer an ECG continuously to make sure that your cat's heart is staying within its normal rhythm.","

263,'Mad Itch' Pseudorabies Virus Infection in Cats,"Suid Herpesvirus in Cats

The pseudorabies virus infection (or Aujeszky's disease) is an uncommon but highly fatal disease found in cats, especially those that come into contact with swine. Unfortunately, many cats infected with this virus die suddenly, often without characteristic signs.

When symptoms do occur, they include excessive salivation, intense itching, and neurologic behavioral changes. Because of the extreme itching it causes, pseudorabies is sometimes referred to as “mad itch.”

The virus infects both dogs and cats -- primarily those living on farms -- as well as other domestic animals such as swine, cattle, sheep, and goats. Otherwise, there is no breed, gender, or age predilection for this viral infection.

If you would like to learn more about how this pseudorabies affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

As previously stated, it is possible a cat suffering from pseudorabies displays no symptoms at all. However, some signs which may be seen include:


	Fever
	Vomiting
	Excessive salivation
	Rapid and labored breathing


Other symptoms and signs may be neurological in nature, such as:


	Depression
	Lethargy
	Ataxia
	Convulsions
	Reluctance to move
	Lying down excessively
	Intense itching and self-mutilation from scratching
	Coma


Causes

Other than direct contact with swine, cats may contract the pseudorabies virus (or Suid herpesvirus 1) by eating contaminated, uncooked meat or offal from swine, or by ingesting infected rats.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will make a diagnosis of the pseudorabies virus infection by comparing it to diseases with similar symptoms. For example, cats with the regular form of rabies will attack anything that moves, and there is no itching or sudden death. Meanwhile, a cat that has been poisoned displays no signs of itching or personality change.

If your cat does recover from this infection, a blood test will reveal pseudorabies virus antibodies. If sudden death should occur, your veterinarian will examine its brain tissue for confirmation of pseudorabies.

 

Treatment

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective medical or medicinal treatment for the pseudorabies virus.

Living and Management

Expected course and prognosis:


	Classic Form of the Infection -- in 60 percent of cases the condition lasts 24 to 36 hours; it is almost invariably fatal.
	Atypical Form of the Infection -- in 40 percent of cases the condition lasts more than 36 hours; it is almost invariably fatal.


There is a mild potential for human infection. Precautions should be taken when treating infected animals, and when handling infected tissues and fluids. Cat-to-cat transmission does not usually occur.

Prevention


	Avoid contact with infected swine, the reservoir host
	Avoid ingestion of contaminated pork
	Avoid ingestion of infected rats"," and Types

264,Lymphoma in Cats,"What Is Lymphoma in Cats?
Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects a cat’s lymphatic system. This system runs throughout the cat’s body and is composed of lymph nodes, ducts, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, and even parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

The lymph nodes are small, bean-like structures present throughout the body. Some of these nodes can be felt in a healthy cat under the jaw, on the neck, in front of the shoulder blades, and behind the knees.

This intricate lymphatic system is vital to maintaining a robust immune system. It transports nutrients throughout the body and eliminates harmful bacteria and viruses.

In cats, lymphoma is sometimes linked to other diseases, such as feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Widespread vaccination has made lymphoma less common due to these conditions. However, lymphoma remains one of the most diagnosed cancers in cats today.

Types of Lymphoma in Cats

Lymphoma can occur in several areas of a cat’s body. Before widespread vaccination for feline leukemia virus, lymphoma tended to occur outside the GI tract. Today, intestinal lymphoma is most common, making up more than 50% of all lymphoma cases.

Typically, cats with lymphoma are older, usually 10 to 12 years old. Cats with intestinal lymphoma can have either a low-grade version, in which they experience thickening of their intestines, or a high-grade version in which large masses are formed in the intestines.

Other forms of lymphoma include:


	
	Mediastinal Lymphoma: Occurs when cats develop masses in their chest, either in the lymph nodes or the thymus gland. The mediastinum is the connective tissue holding the heart and lungs and soft tissue in the chest in place. Mediastinal lymphoma is more common in younger cats. Most of these cats are positive for feline leukemia virus. Siamese cats are more prone to developing this type of lymphoma.
	
	
	Renal Lymphoma: Occurs when lymphoma cancer develops in the kidneys. This type of lymphoma looks a lot like kidney disease, with symptoms including decreased appetite, vomiting, weight loss and an increase in drinking and urinating. Unfortunately, renal lymphoma often spreads to the nervous system, particularly the spinal cord and brain, and can be quite aggressive.
	
	
	Nasal Lymphoma: Occurs when cats develop a tumor in the nasal cavity.  This leads to frequent sneezing and nasal drainage. Sometimes, swelling can be seen on the bridge of the nose in advanced disease.
	
	
	Multicentric Lymphoma: This cancer is primarily in the lymph nodes of the body. Cats that develop multicentric lymphoma are often affected by either the feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus. While this form is uncommon in cats, it is the most common form of lymphoma in dogs.
	


Symptoms of Lymphoma in Cats
The most common form of lymphoma is intestinal lymphoma. Cats with intestinal lymphoma will have gastrointestinal signs, such as:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Appetite changes
	
	
	A mass or firm growth in the abdomen
	


Other forms of lymphoma outside the GI tract have varying signs, depending on which system is affected. Cats with mediastinal lymphoma may struggle to breath and have trouble inflating their lungs due to the presence of a mass in their chest.

Cats with renal lymphoma often present with signs of kidney disease, like increased drinking and urinating, weight loss, and nausea.

Cats with multicentric lymphoma often have firm hard swellings under the chin, on the shoulder, and behind the knee, while nasal lymphoma symptoms can include sneezing or nasal drainage.

Causes of Lymphoma in Cat
Historically, lymphoma has been linked to infection with either the feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus — especially with the mediastinal or multicentric forms of the disease.

Intestinal lymphoma does not seem to be connected to a viral infection. It is more likely due to a combination of genes and environment.

Other environmental factors, like secondhand smoke, have been linked to increasing a cat's risk for developing lymphoma. Cats living in a home where people smoke cigarettes are twice as likely to develop lymphoma.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Lymphoma in Cats
If lymphoma is suspected, your veterinarian will run several tests. First, they will likely run blood work, do a urinalysis, and take x-rays to look for signs of the disease. Specialty blood work may be recommended to check cobalamin (vitamin B12) levels. Low levels can indicate intestinal lymphoma. When intestinal lymphoma is suspected, an abdominal ultrasound is often done to look for widespread thickening of the intestines.

An intestinal biopsy, where tissue is taken for analysis, is the most effective diagnostic method. When a biopsy is performed, the pathologist will grade the lymphoma as either high-grade (more aggressive) or low-grade (less aggressive). This will provide more information regarding likely responses to treatment.

If the lymph nodes are involved, your veterinarian may recommend aspirating them to look at the cells. In this procedure, a needle is stuck into the swollen lymph node and cells are pushed on to a slide to look at under the microscope. Sometimes, advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) is recommended to get a better picture of masses under the surface of the skin, like the chest, kidneys, or nasal cavity.

Treatment of Lymphoma in Cats
Because the lymphatic system runs throughout the body, the disease needs to be treated with oral or injectable medications. The most effective way to do this is with chemotherapy.

In rare situations, cats may undergo surgery to remove the cancerous cells. It is usually performed to excise a nasal tumor or (even more rarely) a solitary abdominal mass. Most patients also will have chemotherapy. Radiation treatment is sometimes performed to shrink larger tumors, especially of the nasal cavity.

Sometimes chemotherapy is not an option, either due to lack of funds or to a pet parent’s preferences. In intestinal lymphoma patients, prednisolone (steroid) therapy alone can be helpful in managing the cancer and adding more quality of life.  Palliative care may be an option to keep your cat comfortable until the disease is no longer manageable.

Recovery and Management of Lymphoma in Cats
The prognosis for cats diagnosed with lymphoma varies depending on the type of lymphoma, when it was diagnosed, and if an underlying disease is present.

Intestinal lymphoma, the most common form of this cancer, tends to have the best outcomes. In cats treated with both prednisolone and chlorambucil, most cats’ lymphoma will go into remission.

While remission does not mean a cure, it does mean there are no longer any clinical signs of cancer. On average, it may be 2-3 years before signs of cancer return in low-grade intestinal lymphoma patients.

Cats treated with prednisolone alone may achieve remission. However, their remission time is much shorter, with the cancer coming back in 2-4 months.

Survival times are much shorter in high-grade intestinal lymphoma, and remission may never be achieved in cats that also have leukemia or FIV. Other sites of lymphoma, like mediastinal or renal lymphoma, are associated with much shorter survival times, often less than 3 months. Unfortunately, renal lymphoma commonly spreads to the brain and spinal cord, leading to rapid progression of the disease and loss of quality of life.

Prevention of Lymphoma in Cats

While there is no way to prevent lymphoma in cats, you can reduce your cat's risk of developing this cancer. Feline leukemia virus is linked to development of several forms of lymphoma. Regular vaccination for leukemia can keep your cat safe from the virus that increases their risk of developing lymphoma. 

If you smoke, avoid smoking in the house and exposing your cat to secondhand smoke, as it may double their risk of developing this cancer.  
Lymphoma in Cats FAQSIs a cat with lymphoma in pain?Lymphoma does not cause acute pain. More commonly it causes a cat to feel tired and under the weather. Cats with lymphoma tend to lose weight and may have some GI disturbances and changes in their appetite. Less common forms of lymphoma may lead to more severe clinical signs, like difficulty breathing.
How long do cats with lymphoma live?Cats with lymphoma can live a couple of months to several years, depending on the type of lymphoma they have and how aggressively they are treated. Whether they have an underlying infection with leukemia or the FIV virus may also affect their survival times.

The most common form of lymphoma is intestinal lymphoma. Cats with intestinal lymphoma will have gastrointestinal signs, such as:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Appetite changes
	
	
	A mass or firm growth in the abdomen
	


Other forms of lymphoma outside the GI tract have varying signs, depending on which system is affected. Cats with mediastinal lymphoma may struggle to breath and have trouble inflating their lungs due to the presence of a mass in their chest.

Cats with renal lymphoma often present with signs of kidney disease, like increased drinking and urinating, weight loss, and nausea.

Cats with multicentric lymphoma often have firm hard swellings under the chin, on the shoulder, and behind the knee, while nasal lymphoma symptoms can include sneezing or nasal drainage.

265,Lymph Node Inflammation (Lymphadenitis) in Cats,"Lymphadenitis in Cats



Lymphadenitis is a condition of the lymph nodes, characterized by inflammation due to an active migration of white blood cells into the lymph nodes. There are different types of white blood cells that can cause this: neutrophils, the most abundant type of white blood cells in the body; macrophages, the cells that engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens in the bloodstream; or eosinophils, the white blood cells of the immune system.



Because of the filtration functions of the lymph nodes, they are likely to be exposed to infectious agents. Lymphadenitis is usually the result of an infectious agent gaining access to a lymph node and establishing an infection, with a resulting response by the immune system to fight the infection with increased white blood cell production. Such infectious agents include fungi and mycobacteria (pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals) .



There is no known genetic basis to lymphadenitis, except for rare cases of immunodeficiency. However, newborn kittens may have a higher rate of occurrence than older cats, since their still undeveloped immune systems make them more susceptible to infection.



Symptoms and Types



Lymphadenitis seldom causes lymph node enlargement that is severe enough for someone unfamiliar with veterinary medicine to observe. Your cat's doctor, however, will be able to locate the firm nodes through palpation, which is often painful for the animal. The cat may also have a fever, suffer from inappetance (anorexia), or display other systemic signs of infection. Bacterial infections, in particular, may develop abscesses within the nodes, which may open to the exterior and present as draining tracts. Other complications will depend on the location of the infection and whether it is affecting surrounding organs.



Causes



Bacterial


	Most pathogenic species have occasionally been reported
	Most likely agents are Pasteurella, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium spp
	A few, such as Yersinia pestis (bubonic plague), and Francisella tularensis (tularemia), have a particular affinity for lymph nodes and are especially likely to be manifest as lymphadenitis, especially in cats
	Bartonella spp can cause lymphoid hyperplasia (proliferation of cells), however, organisms are not detected with routine stains




Fungi


	Infections commonly include lymphadenitis as one manifestation of a systemic disease
	Likely organisms include  Blastomyces, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Coccidiodes, Sporothrix
	Other fungal agents have occasionally been reported




Viruses


	Many viral infections are implicated in lymphoid hyperplasia
	Coronavirus - Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)
	Mesenteric (wall of the abdomen) lymph nodes are most commonly affected




Other


	Protozoa - cats with toxoplasmosis and leishmaniasis frequently have lymphadenitis although it is unlikely to be the most obvious clinical finding
	Noninfectious (e.g., associated with pulmonary or systemic eosinophilic disease) cause is usually unknown




Risk Factors


	Cats with compromised immune function are susceptible to infection and, therefore, to lymphadenitis
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are among the more common causes of immune compromise in veterinary patients








Diagnosis



You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will need to ascertain that a palpable or visible mass is actually a lymph node and not a tumor or another kind of inflammation. Also, it may be difficult to distinguish on the basis of clinical findings from other causes of lymph gland enlargement, or a proliferation of cells in the lymph nodes for some other reason, such as cancer.



To be certain of making the correct diagnosis, your veterinarian will order a complete blood count and urinalysis to look for evidence of bacterial and fungal diseases. If the swollen nodes are in the chest and abdomen, diagnostic testing will include X-ray and ultrasound imaging to make a determination. A fine-needle aspiration of the lymph nodes themselves may also be performed to gather sample of the fluid and tissue that is within the nodes, so that the exact internal composition of the lymph nodes can be analyzed.





Treatment



Because lymphadenitis is a lesion rather than a specific disease, no single set of therapeutic recommendations is appropriate. The characteristics of the inflammation and the causative agent will dictate appropriate treatment. Your veterinarian will plan the treatment based on the evidence that has been collected, and will prescribe a course of treatment following that. Antibiotics may be prescribed; however, the choice of medications will be based on the findings.



Living and Management



You will need to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for treatment. Follow-up exams will need to be scheduled to make sure that all of the infection has been eliminated. Some of the organisms that cause lymphadenitis are zoonotic (can be communicated to humans and other species). If this is the case, your veterinarian will go over home treatment guidelines with you so that you can protect yourself, your family and other pets from being infected."," and Types

266,Lymphadenopathy in Cats,"What Is Lymphadenopathy in Cats?
Lymphadenopathy is the enlargement (swelling) of a single lymph node, a group of lymph nodes, or all lymph nodes. Lymphadenopathy is not a primary disease; it is a symptom of an underlying condition, such as lymphoma, a tick-borne illness, or another infectious disease. This enlargement of lymph nodes can happen quickly or gradually.

Lymph node swelling is most often noticed first in peripheral lymph nodes, those  that can be felt under the skin:


	
	On the neck
	
	
	Behind the jaw
	
	
	In front of the shoulders
	
	
	In the armpits
	
	
	In the inguinal (groin) area
	
	
	Behind the knee joints
	


If you notice any new or growing swelling in these or any other areas of your cat’s body, take them to your veterinarian as soon as possible. Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause.

Symptoms of Lymphadenopathy in Cats
Other than lymph node enlargement, other symptoms depend on the underlying cause of the swollen lymph nodes. They include:


	
	Cough
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Trouble eating
	
	
	Labored/fast breathing
	
	
	Regurgitation
	
	
	Swollen limbs
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Lymph node pain/heat
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	


Causes of Lymphadenopathy in Cats
Lymphadenopathy can affect cats at any age. It is a reaction in the lymph nodes that can be caused by a virus, inflammatory condition, vaccine reaction, tick-borne illness, cancer, or other infection.

Cats that are not on tick preventatives are at a higher risk of developing this condition, due to their susceptibility to tick-borne illnesses. It is important to uncover the underlying cause of the lymph node swelling to decide on the right diagnostics and treatment needed.

Specific causes include:


	
	Reactive hyperplasia—enlargement due to reaction to things like vaccines or immune-mediated disease
	
	
	Lymphadenitis—enlargement due to reaction to things like bacterial infections, rickettsial infections, fungal infections, parasitic infections, and viral infections
	
	
	Neoplasia—primary, such as lymphoma; or secondary, such as carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, or mast cell tumors
	
	
	Rare causes such as edema
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Lymphadenopathy in Cats
After your veterinarian examines your cat, the next step is for them to take a fine needle aspirate of any enlarged lymph nodes. This involves taking a small needle, inserting it into the lymph node, drawing out some cells, spreading these cells onto a microscope slide, and looking at them under the microscope. This is generally not a painful procedure and does not require sedation.

CBC, chemistry panel, and urinalysis, along with diagnostic imaging such as x-rays or CT scan, are often needed to find the underlying cause as well. Imaging can show the severity of disease by finding how large the lymph nodes are, if any internal lymph nodes are abnormal, or if anything else internally looks abnormal and points to an underlying cause. Cats should also be tested for feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), as these are typically underlying conditions causing lymphadenopathy.  

If no cause is initially found, a lymph node biopsy may be needed. This sample would be sent out to a reference lab and processed to figure out what types of cells make up the enlarged lymph node, which would show a potential cause. Less commonly, more advanced testing may be needed.

Treatment of Lymphadenopathy in Cats
Treatment is dependent on the diagnosis of an underlying cause. Treatment could include antibiotics, antifungals, supportive care, chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. For example, lymphoma could be treated with chemotherapy, tick-borne illnesses could be treated with antibiotics like, doxycycline, and supportive care/time in the case of vaccine reactions or viral infections.

Recovery and Management of Lymphadenopathy in Cats
Recovery and prognosis are largely dependent on the underlying cause and how progressive the disease is. For example, recovery for a tick bite infection would potentially be much quicker (maybe weeks to months) and less intense than recovery from an aggressive form of cancer (perhaps untreatable), both of which could cause lymphadenopathy.

Prevention of  Lymphadenopathy in Cats

Most causes of lymphadenopathy are either acquired, infectious, or neoplastic, so unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to prevent these issues. However, tick-borne illnesses can also cause lymphadenopathy, so it is important to keep your pet current on monthly tick preventatives in order to prevent tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme, Babesia, anaplasma, or Ehrlichia.

267,Lyme Disease in Cats,"What Is Lyme Disease in Cats? 
Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Ticks do not cause Lyme disease, but they are a means to transport the bacteria. Ticks that transmit Lyme disease, mostly from the genus Ixodes (which includes deer ticks), acquire the disease as they feed off wildlife like deer, rabbits, and rodents. Lyme disease is common in many areas in North America, infecting up to half of the ticks in some areas. Lyme disease affects many mammals, including humans, dogs, and rarely cats.

Ticks infected with the Borrelia bacteria bite a cat and spread the parasite through their saliva. Once the tick is attached, it takes 24 to 48 hours for Borrelia to start transmitting through the saliva. In the rare case of cats having clinical signs of Lyme, it is similar to the disease in dogs and may be noticeable two to five months after a tick bite. However, most cats do not show any symptoms.

Borrelia species are highly specialized at invading the host’s immune system, and animals can have difficulty clearing the bacteria. Borrelia hides in the skin, joints, connective tissue, and nervous system.

Symptoms of Lyme Disease in Cats 
Cats rarely have signs of Lyme disease. While humans commonly see a red “bull’s eye” rash around the bite, this is uncommon for dogs and cats. Black fly bites are commonly mistaken for a Lyme rash, and a veterinarian should carefully examine the pet.

The most common symptoms, when present, include:


	
	Lameness
	
	
	Fatigue
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Fever
	


Animals with a more severe form of Lyme affecting their kidneys may show:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Severe lethargy
	
	
	Edema (swelling caused by excess fluid) in the limbs
	


Severe cases may cause damage to the nervous system and heart.

Causes of Lyme Disease in Cats
Cats get Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick infected with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. Immature ticks get the bacteria when they are feeding in the fall. The bacteria spreads to cats through the saliva in the tick’s bite, where the Borrelia quickly replicate on the skin and migrate through the cat’s tissues.

Ticks must be attached for 24 to 48 hours before Borrelia is transmitted. Therefore, tick preventatives have time to kill the tick before it can transmit the bacteria, which is why keeping all cats on flea and tick preventatives is so important. There are many options of tick control in cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Lyme Disease in Cats
Lyme disease is diagnosed mainly through history, signs of disease, laboratory tests, and ruling out other diseases with similar symptoms. Because Lyme disease is so uncommon in cats, other conditions—like fractures or abscesses—should be eliminated as potential reasons for limping and infection before Lyme disease is considered.

Testing for Lyme disease involves a positive result on a relatively inexpensive and quick blood test. Additional tests, such as blood work and radiographs, eliminate or diagnose other disorders that may cause similar symptoms. If a cat tests positive for Lyme, additional      tests will also help analyze the severity of the disease.                           

Cats exposed to Lyme disease may not test positive for Lyme disease for two to eight weeks after a bite, if at all. If you find a tick on your cat, you can consider sending it to one of many laboratories that will analyze the tick for any diseases it may be carrying. Cats aren’t routinely tested for tick-borne diseases, like Lyme, but your veterinarian can help you decide on the necessary tests or treatments if you find a tick on your cat.

Treatment of Lyme Disease in Cats
While veterinarians use a few medications to treat Lyme disease, the gold standard is the antibiotic doxycycline. However, not all cats can tolerate this antibiotic. Antibiotics are typically prescribed for 30 days, but cats may need more courses in the future to safeguard against flare-ups.

Pet parents should use caution when using doxycycline in cats. In the tablet form, it can cause esophageal strictures—or narrowing, scar-like formations in the esophagus—if it gets stuck. Many  veterinarians use liquid doxycycline or follow the tablet with a good amount of water.

Some cats may be helped by non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, or other pain relief medications while they are in acute pain from Lyme disease. Typically, animals start feeling better within one or two doses of antibiotics. If cats do not rapidly improve, other diagnoses should be considered.

While most cats can be treated on an outpatient basis, some may need IV fluid therapy, kidney medications, anti-nausea medications, and nutritional support during acute crises. They may require long-term hospitalization for severe cases affecting internal organs.

Recovery and Management of Lyme Disease in Cats
Most cats start feeling better within a day or two after receiving antibiotics. Even though they are feeling better, it is vital to finish the entire course of antibiotics, which is usually a month.

Because Borrelia is good at evading the immune system, it may never be fully cleared. It can hide in joints and other cells in the body, flaring up from time to time. These relapses may require more courses of antibiotics.

Lyme disease in cats is extremely rare. However, complications include arthritis and long-term kidney damage.

Prevention of Lyme Disease in Cats

While there is a Lyme vaccine for dogs, there is no vaccine for cats. Tick preventatives for cats are the best way to avoid and prevent Lyme disease in cats. There are a variety of tick preventatives on the market, and your veterinarian can help you decide the best choice for your pet. Remove any ticks you may find on your pet.

Lyme disease is zoonotic, which means it can infect humans. However, cats cannot transmit Lyme disease directly to pet parents. An infected tick would need to bite a human.      
Lyme Disease in Cats FAQs Can cats survive Lyme disease? Yes, the few cats who show signs of Lyme disease typically recover.
How long does it take for a cat to get Lyme disease? Cats may show signs of illness two to five months after being infected with Lyme disease from a tick.
Is Lyme disease contagious from cats to humans? Cats cannot transmit Lyme disease directly to humans. However, unattached, infected ticks can be brought into the home by dogs and cats. These ticks may bite and transmit Lyme disease to humans, so tick prevention is crucial for all animals.

268,Luxating Patellas in Cats,"What Is Luxating Patella in Cats?
A luxating patella is a physical condition in which the kneecap, called the patella, moves out or becomes dislocated from its normal position (luxates). In people, this condition is sometimes referred to as a “trick knee.” 

In cats, the knee joint is set between the thigh (femur) and the shin (tibia). The kneecap itself is an oval-shaped bone set in a deep groove called the trochlear groove at the end of the thigh. 

A patella luxation occurs when the kneecap moves away (either inside or outside) from this groove. If it moves to the inside, it’s known as a medial patellar luxation (MPL). When the kneecap moves outside the groove, a vet will typically diagnose it as a lateral patellar luxation (LPL). 

For either type, a luxating patella is diagnosed based on a grading system (I to IV), with the severity increasing as the grades go higher. The grades are: 


	Grade I patellar luxation means that the patella can be pushed out of the trochlear groove with manual pressure but will immediately return to its original position when pressure is removed. 

	 
	Grade II patellar luxation means that the patella will sometimes move in and out of the trochlear groove on its own and only moves back to its original position when the leg is extended and rotated (most cats will do this on their own and do not need help replacing the kneecap). 

	 
	Grade III patellar luxation means that the patella is out of the trochlear groove the majority of the time but can be pushed back into the groove with manual pressure (basically the opposite of Grade I). 

	 
	Grade IV patellar luxation means that the patella is always out of the groove and cannot be replaced with manual pressure. 


Over time, the kneecap’s constant movement in and out of the trochlear groove will rub away the cartilage in the joint, causing inflammation and eventually arthritis. 

Arthritis causes pain and stiffness and can eventually lead to the breakdown of other vital ligaments in the knee joint, such as the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL), making the cat more prone to CCL tears. 
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Luxating Patella in Cats 
Symptoms of luxating patella in cats include: 


	
	Occasional or constant limping 
	
	
	Difficulty jumping onto things like beds and tables 
	
	
	“Skipping” on a back leg (holding it up for a few steps then replacing weight onto that leg) 
	


As the grade of the luxation increases, so does the lameness. Cats with grades III and IV tend to show persistent lameness and, if both of their knees are affected, they can even have a bow-legged or dropped stance/crouched appearance in the back legs. 

With arthritis, a cat may yowl, cry, or make other noises indicating pain or discomfort when getting up from their current position. Your cat may also be unwilling to move around, making it easy to confuse this behavior with lethargy or poor appetite, when in reality the cat is just too sore to get up, play, and eat or drink. 

Causes of Luxating Patella in Cats 


 

Patellar luxation is not common in most breeds of cats. Most patellar luxations in cats are medial, meaning the kneecap moves within the trochlear groove, and are caused by abnormalities in the cat's anatomy. In other words, they are usually due to genetics. For example, if the trochlear groove is too shallow, the kneecap has a greater opportunity to shift. 

This can also occur from other abnormalities, such as if the ligaments that overlay the kneecap are off center, or if the leg bones are curved. 

Injury can also cause this condition, such as from falling or other blunt force trauma. If the cause is trauma, a cat will suddenly show signs of a luxating patella. If it is caused by genetics, the onset of symptoms may be more gradual as the cat ages. 

Patellar luxation (along with hip dysplasia) is seen most commonly in Abyssinians, the Devon Rex, and the domestic shorthair.   

How Veterinarians Diagnose Luxating Patella in Cats 
A luxating patella is typically diagnosed during physical examination by a veterinarian. Your veterinarian will massage and feel the knee and manipulate the patella to see if movement is possible. They will also monitor your cat’s gait while he walks to note any lameness or “skipping” motions. 

A grade I patellar luxation is usually discovered incidentally during a cat’s regular examination, because most cats will not show any obvious signs of pain or lameness unless they have sustained an injury that causes the joint to swell. 

If the luxation is chronic, the vet may detect a grating sound when palpating the affected joint. 

Radiographs of the knee joint are usually taken to determine the severity of arthritis, if any, and to check for any other abnormalities. This is especially important if the luxation is due to trauma.  

Treating Luxating Patella in Cats 
Treating luxating patella depends on its severity, as well as the cat’s age, their clinical signs, and any other anatomical abnormalities or injuries. 

Mild to moderate luxation may be treated with rest and anti-inflammatory medication while more severe cases often require surgical correction. Surgery should be considered for any cat that continually or intermittently limps, lameness that lasts over 1 to 4 weeks, or is diagnosed with a grade III or IV patellar luxation. 


	
	Grade I luxations may be treated with rest, anti-inflammatory medication, and similar supportive therapy. 
	
	
	Grade II luxations may require surgical correction, depending on age, other injuries, or abnormalities. 
	
	
	Grade III and IV luxations should receive surgical correction. Surgery is recommended sooner to avoid arthritis developing in the joint. 
	


If surgery is required, a vet can deepen the grove (called trochleoplasty) to tighten the joint capsule and surrounding soft tissue to improve stability that can be used to repair a luxating patella. Other surgeries might be done to correct the patellar ligament (called tibial tuberosity transposition).  

After surgery, the vet will usually suggest that the pet parent restricts exercise for at least 2 weeks, while encouraging mild activity. If the luxation requires more aggressive surgical correction, the vet may recommend 4 to 6 weeks before any exercise. 

Recovering from Luxating Patella in Cats 
As with treatment, recovery depends on the severity of the luxating patella. It usually involves appropriate rest as well as pain and anti-inflammatory medication, and the cat should regain full use of the leg. If arthritis has already developed in the joint, there may be intermittent soreness/pain in the leg. 


	
	Prognosis for grade I, the mildest type, is typically positive, even without surgery
	
	
	Prognosis for grade II and III is typically positive although the cat may require surgical correction
	
	
	Prognoses for grade IV and chronic luxations are guarded due to a higher likelihood of arthritis
	


Cats with grade IV patellar luxation (or had a previous femoral fracture or knee surgery) have a higher risk of complications. 

Managing the condition for all grades may include: 


	
	Reducing weight 
	
	
	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) 
	
	
	Pain medications (such as Gabapentin or Buprenorphine) 
	
	
	Joint supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, omega 3/6 fatty acids) and polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (Adequan)
	


Be aware of your cat’s environment, especially if they seem uncomfortable or are recovering from surgery, help to avoid the stairs, and place the litter box and food/water near the cat’s sleeping area.  
Luxating Patella in Cats  FAQsIs Luxating Patella in cats painful?Luxating patella in cats can be painful if moderate to severe, or if arthritis has formed in the joint. Usually this pain can be controlled with rest and anti-inflammatory medications. 
How can I help my cat with luxating patella?Weight reduction is very important. The less weight placed on the joint, the less luxation and pain. Using joint supplements is helpful to reduce inflammation in the knee joint. If you’re concerned that your cat has a luxating patella, call your veterinarian to schedule a consultation. The sooner a patellar luxation is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis for full return to function on the affected leg. 
Can a luxating patella correct itself in cats? A grade I luxating patella typically occurs infrequently and is often not visible. Though they can’t correct themselves, cats often live a full life without pain or lameness. Grade II, III, and IV luxating patellas cannot correct themselves due to the underlying anatomical abnormalities.

Symptoms of luxating patella in cats include: 


	
	Occasional or constant limping 
	
	
	Difficulty jumping onto things like beds and tables 
	
	
	“Skipping” on a back leg (holding it up for a few steps then replacing weight onto that leg) 
	


As the grade of the luxation increases, so does the lameness. Cats with grades III and IV tend to show persistent lameness and, if both of their knees are affected, they can even have a bow-legged or dropped stance/crouched appearance in the back legs. 

With arthritis, a cat may yowl, cry, or make other noises indicating pain or discomfort when getting up from their current position. Your cat may also be unwilling to move around, making it easy to confuse this behavior with lethargy or poor appetite, when in reality the cat is just too sore to get up, play, and eat or drink.

269,"Lungworms in Cats: What Are They, and How Do You Treat Them?","What Are Lungworms in Cats?
Lungworms in cats are small (less than 1 cm) parasites that infect cats around the world. It’s estimated that up to 50% of cats allowed outside may be infected with lungworms, but this number is much lower in indoor pet cats.

A cat gets infected with lungworms by eating an animal that’s infected with tiny lungworm babies, called larvae.

The larvae then work their way from the cat’s digestive tract to the lungs, where the larvae grow into adult worms (about eight to nine days after infection) and lay eggs (about four weeks after infection).

In the lungs, the lungworm eggs hatch into larvae. The cat coughs up the larvae and swallows them, and then the larvae are passed into the cat’s stool where the life cycle restarts. Adult lungworms live in the lungs for nine months or longer.

The worms cause irritation and disease in the lung tissues, which can lead to no symptoms, mild symptoms, or serious lung issues including pneumonia or trouble breathing, which is a medical emergency.

Lungworms in cats can be tricky to diagnose because the symptoms can look like other diseases such as asthma, heartworm disease, bronchitis, and pneumonia.

Symptoms of Lungworms in Cats
Cats infected with lungworms may seem healthy with no clinical signs. Lungworms in cats can cause a wide range of symptoms, including:


	Coughing
	Trouble breathing, open-mouth breathing, or panting
	Sneezing
	Wheezing
	Tiny worms seen in what your cat has coughed up
	Loss of appetite (anorexia)
	Weight loss
	Lethargy


Causes of Lungworms in Cats
Cats get lungworms when lungworm babies (larvae) are eaten.

This can happen when a cat eats a rodent, small bird, frog, toad, snake, lizard, snail, or slug that is infected with the lungworm larvae.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Lungworms in Cats
If your cat has spent time outdoors and is having symptoms including coughing, wheezing, or breathing issues, your veterinarian may suspect that your cat has lungworms.

To diagnose lungworms in cats, your veterinarian may offer tests, including:


	
	Physical examination, which will include listening to your cat’s lungs and heart.
	
	
	Microscopic identification of worms from the stool (fecal examination) using a specific method called the Baermann technique (sent to a lab or done by your vet). This is the most accurate way to diagnose lungworms.
	
	
	Chest X-rays (done by your vet). Your vet will screen your cat for abnormal changes in their lungs.
	
	
	If you can see worms in what your cat has coughed up, your veterinarian may want to do a microscopic test to identify the worms (sent to a lab or done by your vet).
	


Treatment of Lungworms in Cats
Lungworms are treatable with either oral and/or topical medications prescribed by your veterinarian.

Your vet may prescribe one of these treatments for lungworms:


	
	Advantage Multi™ Topical Solution
	
	
	NexGard® COMBO
	
	
	Profender™ Topical Solution
	
	
	Revolution®
	
	
	Fenbenazole
	


Lungworms may be killed with a single course of treatment, but most cats are treated for two months.

Depending on the severity of your cat’s infection (number of worms) and your cat’s health status (amount of lung damage), your vet may prescribe multiple dosages of an anti-parasitic medication for you to give on a schedule.

For very sick cats with severe breathing problems, veterinarians may need to prescribe additional medications, such as ones that decrease airway swelling (corticosteroids) and ones that help your cat breathe easier (bronchodilators).

Recovery and Management of Lungworms in Cats
Cats that are mildly infected with lungworms can completely recover within a few weeks with anti-parasitic treatment.

If your cat has symptoms, your vet may recommend an immune system supplement such as Imuquin® powder on your cat’s food, and an omega fatty acid supplement to help decrease airway swelling and provide immune system support.

Some lungworm infections may even clear up on their own without treatment. Rarely, young kittens, weakened cats, or cats with lowered immune systems (immunocompromised) can’t be cured.
Can an indoor cat get lungworm?Yes, an indoor cat can get lungworm if they eat an infected rodent, snail, or slug that comes inside the house, but this is unlikely with good pest control.

Outdoor, free-roaming cats who hunt and eat infected rodents, birds, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, snails, and slugs are at the highest risk of getting lungworms.
Is lungworm in cats contagious to humans?No, lungworms are not contagious to people.

270,Lung Lobe Twisting in Cats,"Lung Lobe Torsion in Cats
 
In lung lobe torsion, one of the lung's lobes becomes twisted, which results in obstruction of the bronchus and vessels, including the veins and arteries. The obstruction of the blood vessels causes the lung lobe to engorge with blood, which results in necrosis and death of the affected lung tissue. This may lead to many complications, including coughing up blood, tachycardia, or shock.
 
Though lung lobe torsion is rare in cats, it is still a very serious condition, one which will require immediate veterinary attention.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Pain
    Fever
    Lethargy
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Coughing (sometimes with blood)
    Difficulty breathing, especially while lying flat (orthopenea)
    Increased respiration rate
    Coughing up blood
    Increased heart rate
    Pale or bluish mucous membranes (cyanosis)
    Shock

 
Causes
 
Lung lobe torsion is inconsistently found with pre-existing conditions such as trauma, neoplasia, and chylothorax. However it also occurs spontaneously, due to a thoracic or diaphragmatic surgery, or, on occasion, due to an unknown cause (idiopathic).
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis and may show signs of infection, anemia. It will also reveal the level of immune response of your cat. If the number of white blood cells is abnormally lower than the minimum normal range, the prognosis is very poor.

Your cat’s veterinarian may decide to take a small sample of the accumulated fluid for further evaluation, while ultrasound, computed tomography, and radiographic studies often reveal more details about the problem. Loss of normal architecture and blood vessels, along with opacification of the affected lung are usually seen in an X-ray.
 
In some cases, surgery is required for definitive diagnosis and treatment.





Treatment
 
Your cat may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment, especially if surgery is required, which is often the treatment of choice to remove the affected lobe and correct other abnormalities. If abnormal fluid or blood is present, your veterinarian will place a chest tube to allow for drainage. If your cat is not able to breathe normally, ventilator support is given to assist in breathing. Oxygen therapy, fluids, and antibiotics are also typically added to treatment protocol. And if the cat survives, shrinking and fibrosis of the affected lobe will be seen.
 
Living and Management
 
After surgery, your cat may feel sore and need pain killers, as well as cage rest, for a few days. However, most animals recover fully after a successful operation. The chest tube is often kept in for a few days to allow drainage of fluid. Your veterinarian will describe the proper handling of this tube. If you see any untoward symptoms, including breathing problems, immediately call your cat’s veterinarian. Otherwise, follow his or her instructions and bring the cat in for regular examinations."," and Types

271,Lung Fungal Infections in Cats,"What Is a Lung Fungal Infection in Cats?
Fungus includes any of a group of organisms that produce spores and feed on organic matter, including molds, yeast, mushrooms, and toadstools. When spores of a fungal organism invade the lungs, a pulmonary infection can develop.

Cats become infected by breathing in spores floating in the air. The spores typically enter through the nose and make their way to the lungs, eventually growing into a yeast form. The presence of the fungal organism in the lungs triggers the body’s defenses to form lesions in the lungs. This leads to symptoms such as coughing, rapid and labored breathing, fever, and discomfort.

Fungal infections in cats are rare, but they can be fatal if not treated.

Types of Lung Fungal Infections in Cats



The four most common lung fungal infections in cats are:



Blastomycosis:


	
	Caused by a fungus known as Blastomyces dermatitidis
	
	
	It is most common in the river basins of Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Ohio, but is also found around the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway.
	
	
	 The fungus is native to Africa, India, Europe, Central America, and a few Canadian provinces.
	
	
	 Coughing and difficulty breathing are the most common symptoms.
	


Coccidioidomycosis:


	
	Caused by the Coccidioides fungal species
	
	
	This type of fungus prefers arid and semi-arid environments of the US Southwest, Mexico, and Central and South America.
	
	
	Coccidioidomycosis has many symptoms, ranging from being asymptomatic (no visible symptoms) to severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing.
	


Cryptococcosis:


	
	A fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii
	
	
	C. neoformans is found worldwide, while C. gattii is native to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and Central and South America.
	
	
	Cats acquire the fungus by inhaling the spores from the soil, decayed wood, or bird guano, especially from pigeons.
	
	
	 Upper respiratory symptoms are most common, such as:

	
		
		Sneezing
		
		
		Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose
		
		
		Polyps in the nasal passages
		
		
		Nasal discharge
		
		
		Difficulty breathing
		
	
	
	
	Lower respiratory disease is less common, but if the fungus infects the lungs, cats will have coughing as well as rapid and labored breathing.
	


Histoplasmosis:


	
	Caused by Histoplasma capsulatum
	
	
	This fungus is a common inhabitant of soil that contains fecal matter from birds and bats. It can be found globally, and in the United States it is predominantly found along the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.
	
	
	The spores spread primarily to the lungs, as well as to the lymph nodes in the chest.
	


Cats that live or spend time outdoors are more at risk for acquiring a lung fungal infection.

According to some research, the Havana Brown, Siamese, and Abyssinian breeds are believed to be more prone to blastomycosis, while Siamese, Himalayan, Birman, and Ragdoll cats are prone to cryptococcosis. Persian cats have been reported to have a higher incidence of histoplasmosis.

However, it is not clear whether any particular breed is at higher risk of contracting a fungal lung infection.

Symptoms of Lung Fungal Infections in Cats
Fungal infections have a wide range of symptoms, including:


	
	Coughing
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Discomfort
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	


Causes of Lung Fungal Infections in Cats
The environment plays an important role as to where certain fungi flourish. Blastomycosis fungi prefer areas where there is natural water and acidic soil that is sandy and moist. Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis fungi grow best in guano or decaying wood. Coccidioidomycosis fungi grow best in arid and semi-arid areas after a dust storm.

Once these fungi establish an area to grow, they release spores into the air that a cat may breathe in. These spores then invade the lungs and other areas of the cat's body.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Lung Fungal Infections in Cats
There are several diagnostic tests that can be done to determine if a cat has a lung fungal infection. A few of the options:


	Cytology: A veterinarian gathers tissue samples from a cat, which will then be analyzed with a stain that highlights the fungal organism. Urine, nasal swabs, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), or fluid obtained from the lungs can also be examined.



	Radiography: While x-rays cannot provide a definite diagnosis, they are helpful in determining if a fungal infection is possible, leading to further testing. If a fungal infection is present, the lungs may contain nodules and have a ""snowstorm"" appearance or have other various abnormal lung patterns.

	 
	Antigen and antibody tests: These tests are very sensitive and highly specific, as they test for the antigen or antibody levels for the specific fungus in specimens. False positive and negative test results may occur, so the results of these tests are often interpreted with other diagnostic tests to reach a definitive diagnosis.

	 
	Fungal culture: Using urine, CSF, joint fluid, tissue, or fine needle aspirates, a culture can grow the fungus so it can be examined. Fungal cultures are not done to test for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, or coccidioidomycosis because these fungal organisms would be harmful to laboratory workers.

	 
	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay: This test can detect and identify a fungus in a deep pharyngeal or nasal swab, fluid from the lungs or trachea, aspirate, or biopsy of infected tissue. It takes one to four days to obtain test results.

	 
	Histopathology: Biopsy samples from an infected tissue or organ or necropsy specimens can be sectioned and stained to scan microscopically for the presence of fungi.


Treatment of Lung Fungal Infections in Cats
Oral anti-fungal medication is often prescribed to treat lung fungal infections in cats. The type of medication used and the length of treatment varies, based on the type and severity of the infection. A lung fungal infection usually requires several months of treatment. The following anti-fungal medications are commonly prescribed for treatment of lung fungal infections in cats:


	Itraconazole: This oral anti-fungal medication is the preferred treatment for histoplasmosis.

	 
	Fluconazole: This oral anti-fungal medication is often the treatment of choice for cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

	 
	Ketoconazole: This oral anti-fungal medication is less effective compared to itraconazole or fluconazole and can be toxic to the liver. This medication is typically used if other treatments are too costly.

	 
	Amphotericin B (AMB): This medication is often prescribed when a cat has a severe fungal infection in the lungs and other areas of the body. Amphotericin B is given as an injection, usually 3 days a week for 3-4 weeks. It can be the sole therapy or given along with an oral anti-fungal medication. Amphotericin B can cause toxicity to the kidneys, so cats on this medication should have bloodwork and a urinalysis test done periodically to monitor their kidney function


Recovery and Management of Lung Fungal Infections in Cats
Recovery time varies, based on the type of lung fungal infection and severity of the infection. The length of treatment for any of the above anti-fungal medications is based on antigen titers (tests). When the titer reaches zero, treatment is discontinued. Titers are usually conducted every 3-6 months to check for a relapse of infection. If the titer is unchanged after 2 months of treatment, then a different treatment plan is prescribed. If a cat has a relapse of infection, they are treated again.

The best way to reduce risk for infection is to keep cats strictly indoors, reducing the chance to breathe in harmful fungal spores. Indoor cats are less likely to acquire lung fungal infections but are still at risk.  Indoor cats should be kept away from house plants, as the soil in the pots could contain fungus. Unfinished basements should also be off limits to cats because they commonly have dirt floors that may contain fungi.
Lung Fungal Infections in Cats FAQs How do you treat a fungal lung infection in cats?Cats are given oral and/or injectable anti-fungal medication over several months for treatment. Recurrence of infection can occur, so monitoring titer levels after treatment is also important.
How do cats get fungus in their lungs?Cats breathe in fungal spores from the air. Once the spores enter the nasal passages, they can then spread to the lungs and cause infection.
Can cats recover from fungal infection?Yes, cats can fully recover from fungal infections. However, prognosis depends on the type of fungus and how quickly it is diagnosed and treated. If the infection is severe and affects multiple organs, not just the lungs, then prognosis is guarded.
How long do cats live with histoplasmosis?Based on two studies involving 52 cats with histoplasmosis, about half lived through the end of each study. The median survival time between the two studies varied.  In one study, the median survival time was 1.5 years and in the other study the median survival time was about 2 years.

272,Lung Cancer in Cats,"What Is Lung Cancer in Cats?
Cancer in cats is a concerning diagnosis—and lung cancer is especially alarming. But understanding your pet’s condition can help.

Lung cancer in cats is when tumors, or masses of cancerous cells, develop in the lungs. Lung cancer is clinically called pulmonary (relating to or affecting the lungs) neoplasia (uncontrolled abnormal cell growth).

Lung cancer can be primary or secondary. Primary lung tumors start in the lungs. Secondary, or metastatic, lung tumors start in another part of the body and spread to the lungs.

Lung tumors damage the lungs and affect their ability to move oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream. Tumors may also squeeze the lungs or allow fluid to accumulate around the lungs, making it more difficult for your cat to breathe.

Primary lung cancer in cats is rare. Of 5,643 cat cancer cases presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation, only 39 (0.69%) were primary lung tumors (pulmonary carcinomas).

However, primary lung cancer is diagnosed more often than it was 20 years ago. This could be due to better detection methods, an increase in exposure to environmental carcinogens (tobacco smoke, radon, and other types of pollution), and cats living longer lives.

On the other hand, the lungs are a common organ for cancer to metastasize to from other parts of the body, so secondary lung tumors are more prevalent than primary.

Primary lung tumors have a better prognosis, but survival rates are affected by many factors, including tumor type, severity, and when the cancer was first diagnosed. Secondary lung tumors typically have a poor prognosis because cancer is already present in other parts of the body.

Types of Lung Cancer in Cats

A study that investigated the different types of primary lung tumors in cats found three main types of cancer:


	
	Pulmonary adenocarcinoma—Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a cancerous tumor that usually develops from the glands that line the bronchi (airways within the lungs). 82% of primary lung tumors in cats were pulmonary adenocarcinomas.
	
	
	Bronchogenic carcinomas—Tumors arising from other tissues within the bronchi were responsible for another 11% of primary lung tumors.
	
	
	Squamous cell carcinoma—The remaining 7% of tumors involved two types of squamous cell carcinomas, which arise from the outermost layer of the epithelial tissue (the squamous epithelium) that lines airways.
	


There are many different types of secondary lung tumors in cats. Cancer of almost every sort that is located virtually anywhere in the body can metastasize to the lungs.

Symptoms of Lung Cancer in Cats
Signs of all types of lung cancer in cats can include:


	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Rapid breathing (more than 40 breaths per minute)
	
	
	Loud breathing
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Coughing that may contain blood
	
	
	Vomiting or diarrhea
	
	
	Lameness due to lung digit syndrome (tumors spreading to one or more of the toes)
	


Causes of Lung Cancer in Cats
Few cancers have a single known cause. Lung cancer risk is likely dependent on environmental, genetic, and other factors.

Males and females appear to be equally affected, but older cats are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer.

Research on 39 cats found that Persians were four times more likely than any other breed to develop lung cancer. Exposure to cigarette smoke has been linked to lung tumors in pets and may increase the chance that a cat will develop the disease.

Your veterinarian will initially perform a complete physical examination, including listening to your cat’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood work and urinalysis will probably be recommended to evaluate your cat’s internal organs.

Chest X-rays are often the first step in identifying tumor presence. Staging (searching for spread to other body locations) is usually recommended as well.

A CT scan or MRI can help the vet better visualize lung tumors. CT scans can reveal a tumor’s exact location, how invasive it is, and any potential spread to other parts of the body.

If there is still uncertainty in a diagnosis, your cat’s veterinarian may perform a fine needle aspirate, where a small needle is used to take a sample of the tumor cells and view them under a microscope. A tissue biopsy is more invasive and involves taking a piece of the tumor for analysis. This method can most definitively diagnose lung cancer in cats.

To provide the most accurate information to your veterinarian—and to ensure you don’t forget anything—write down your cat’s symptoms as you observe them prior to your veterinary visit.

Your cat’s veterinarian likely has records of previous care, but you may want to check that all prior history, including anything involving tumors, is accounted for.

Treatment of Lung Cancer in Cats
If cancer is diagnosed, your cat’s vet may refer you to a veterinary oncologist who can help you decide the best treatment plan moving forward. Your options will depend on the size, location, and stage of your cat’s cancer and your cat’s overall health.

Surgery to remove the portion of the lung with the tumor, or the entire lung itself, may be recommended for single tumors that are slow-growing. Tumors that cannot be removed may be treated with chemotherapy or radiation.

Radiation can help slow the growth of primary tumors. Chemotherapy is more likely to be recommended if the cancer has spread.

If treatment is not possible, palliative care (symptom relief) is the next best option.

Palliative care may include:


	
	Pain medication
	
	
	Fluid therapy
	
	
	Nutritional support
	
	
	Cough suppressants
	
	
	Anti-inflammatory medications (including corticosteroids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone)
	
	
	Antibiotics (to fight secondary infections)
	
	
	Thoracocentesis (to help remove fluid build-up around the lungs)
	


Recovery and Management of Lung Cancer in Cats
Radiation therapy may inflame lung tissue and have a sunburn-like effect on the skin. Chemotherapy can also have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

Cats who receive surgery may require intensive care, such as oxygen therapy, before being released. Once home from surgery, there are several ways you can support your cat’s care:


	
	Keep them in a quiet confined space for at least two weeks.
	



	
	Be attentive to their breathing.
	
	
	Limit their exposure to anything that could irritate their lungs, like secondhand smoke and other air pollutants.
	
	
	Make follow-up vet appointments.
	
	
	Follow aftercare instructions and give medication as prescribed.
	


Recovery times vary. Post-op recovery times are typically shorter for thoracoscopic procedures (a small camera is placed into the chest and incisions made with instruments) than thoracotomy procedures (traditional open chest surgery).

Your vet will instruct you on the best items for recovery after treatment. These may include:


	
	Surgical recovery body suit
	
	
	Recovery cone
	
	
	Soft collar
	
	
	Pet pen
	
	
	Waterproof blanket

Prevention of Lung Cancer in Cats
To promote your cat’s health and reduce lung cancer risk:


	
	Routinely take your cat to the vet to help catch cancer early.
	
	
	Reduce your cat’s exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke.
	
	
	Consider running an indoor air purifier if you live in an urban environment. The link between city living and lung cancer in cats is not well-established, but cities are known to have higher amounts of air pollution, which may contribute to tumor development.

273,Low Production of Parathyroid Hormone in Cats,"Hypoparathyroidism in Cats
  
An absolute or relative deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood, a condition called hypoparathyroidism, may be characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to hypocalcemia. The parathyroid hormone regulates calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, normally increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from the bone.

The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands, which are in turn located at the front of the neck, in alignment with the larynx and trachea.

Mixed-breed cats are most commonly diagnosed, and it often appears secondary to surgical removal of the thyroid glands for treatment of excessive levels of thyroid hormone (known as hyperthyroidism). Less commonly diagnosed forms are due to parathyroiditis, and atrophy of the parathyroid glands.  The average age of diagnosis is 12 to 13 years, with a range of 4 to 22 years of age. Spontaneous hypoparathyroidism occurs on average around two to three years of age, with an age range six months to seven years.
  
Symptoms


    Sluggishness (lethargy), lack of 	appetite, and depression
    Seizures
    Muscle trembling, twitching, or 	involuntary muscle contractions
    Panting
    Cataracts
    Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
    Fever
    Low body temperature (hypothermia)


Causes

This condition occurs most commonly in cats that have damaged parathyroid glands, or have had the parathyroid glands removed during surgical removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy) in the course of being treated for  excessive levels of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). It may also occur due to a decrease in tissue of the parathyroid glands, usually of unknown cause. Immune-mediated inflammation of the parathyroid glands may also be seen.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you are able to provide. Standard testing, including a complete blood profile will be conducted, as well as a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will usually return normal in the case of hypoparathyroidism; however, they are important in discounting any other underlying disorders.



Because there are several possible causes for the symptoms described here, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. The main problems associated with hypoparathyroidism that must be differentiated from other disease processes are seizures, weakness, muscle trembling, and twitching.

Some of the causes that will need to be ruled out are heart related diseases, metabolic diseases, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hepatoencephalopathy (liver disease that affects the brain's functioning). Neurological causes that will need to be ruled out are inflammatory diseases, tumors, or epilepsy.

An exploration of the cervical section of the throat may reveal that the parathyroid glands are absent or have atrophied (wasted).

Treatment

Your cat may need to be hospitalized initially for medical management of low levels of calcium in the blood, at least until the clinical signs are controlled. Other treatment will be dependent on whether any other underlying conditions have been diagnosed.

Emergency treatment is usually only needed for certain patients, such as those with primary hypoparathyroidism, or hypoparathyroidism that is secondary to procedures that have been used to correct excessive levels of thyroid hormone or excessive levels of parathyroid hormone -- that is, procedures that have been medically used to lower the amount of parathyroid hormone in the blood, and have resulted in levels of parathyroid hormone that are now too low.

If your cat has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, low calcium levels in the blood, your doctor will prescribe long-term treatment for the condition. Vitamin D will be needed indefinitely, with the dosage amount determined by your veterinarian, based on your cat's needs. Calcium supplements can be given by mouth, again, with the type and dose of calcium supplement directed by your veterinarian.

If your cat is suffering from hypoparathyroidism related to a thyroidectomy, there is a good chance that they will recover normal functioning of the parathyroid glands within several months time.

Living and Management

Both low levels of calcium in the blood and excessive levels of calcium in the blood are concerns that will need to be managed over the long-term. Initially, your veterinarian will want to see your cat frequently in order to follow your cat's progress and to make changes to care as needed. Once serum calcium is stable and normal, your veterinarian will assess serum calcium concentration monthly for six months, and then every two to four months.","

274,Low Platelets in Cats,"What Are Low Platelets in Cats?
Platelets are small, round, or oval-shaped cells produced by the bone marrow that circulate in the bloodstream. They clump together to form a blood clot that stops bleeding when there are damaged blood vessels.

When a cat has a low platelet count (also known as thrombocytopenia), serious bleeding and bruising can occur if the cat suffers an injury. The bruises may vary in size and appear anywhere on the body.

Thrombocytopenia is rare in cats and is considered a medical emergency due to the potential for severe internal bleeding. This condition can be fatal if it isn’t treated quickly.

Possible causes of thrombocytopenia in cats include autoimmune diseases, infections, cancer, and toxicity.

Symptoms of Low Platelets in Cats
While thrombocytopenia can sometimes be asymptomatic initially, symptoms will later develop and may include:


	
	Bruising (ecchymosis)
	
	
	Uncontrollable bleeding from a wound
	
	
	Pinpoint red spots on the skin or gums (petechiae)
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Collapse
	
	
	Pale pink or white gums
	
	
	Vomiting blood
	
	
	Bloody diarrhea
	
	
	Black, tarry stools
	
	
	Nosebleeds
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Retinal hemorrhage
	
	
	Blood in the front chamber of the eye (hyphema)
	


Causes of Low Platelets in Cats
There are various possible causes for a low platelet count in cats. Here are a few of the common ones.


	
	Infectious diseases, such as:

	
		
		Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
		
		
		Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
		
		
		Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)
		
		
		Feline distemper (panleukopenia virus)
		
		
		Mycoplasmosis
		
		
		Ehrlichiosis
		
		
		Salmonellosis
		
		
		Histoplasmosis
		
		
		Toxoplasmosis
		
		
		Heartworm disease 
		
		
		Cytauxzoonosis
		
	
	
	
	Autoimmune disease—Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia
	
	
	Cancers—Lymphoma, leukemia, hemangiosarcoma
	
	
	Medications, such as: 

	
		
		Carprofen
		
		
		Trimethoprim-sulfa
		
		
		Methimazole
		
		
		Phenobarbital
		
		
		Other chemotherapeutic medications
		
	
	
	
	Rodenticide (rat poison) toxicity
	
	
	Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)—A blood-clotting disorder
	


All cats, regardless of breed, age, or gender, are equally at risk for developing thrombocytopenia.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Low Platelets in Cats
Veterinarians rely on several factors to diagnose this condition, including:


	
	Medical history—It is important to discuss with your veterinarian any symptoms that your cat is displaying at home, such as nosebleeds, collapse, or bruising of the skin.
	
	
	Physical exam—A veterinarian will examine your cat’s mouth for pale gums and red spots (petechiae) and look for bruising on the body, as well as wounds that continue to bleed.

	
		
		A fever or heart murmur may also be found during an exam. Cats with a low platelet count can also appear to be healthy during a physical exam with no indications of having a bleeding disorder.
		
	
	
	
	Blood cell count—This blood test measures a cat’s platelet count as well as the counts of white and red blood cells.
	
	
	Blood smear—A manual platelet count can help determine if a cat’s platelets are low. This test also helps identify platelet clumping and can help confirm if a previous low platelet reading was false.
	
	
	Anti-platelet antibody test—This blood test screens for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, a condition in which a cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets.     
	
	
	Coagulation tests—Blood clotting tests may be recommended to check for DIC, assess if a cat has a bleeding disorder, or may have ingested rodenticide.
	
	
	Bone marrow biopsy—A biopsy of the bone marrow can be analyzed to check for cancer, infectious agents, and other diseases that might prevent a cat’s ability to produce platelets.
	


Treatment of Low Platelets in Cats
Treatment depends on the underlying cause.

For example, if an infection is causing a low platelet count, then treating the infection should return the platelet count to normal.

Cats with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia are prescribed immunosuppressive medication like prednisolone. Some cats with this condition can be slowly tapered off medication completely, while others may require long-term use at the lowest effective dose.

For cats with low platelet counts due to cancer, treatment options may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.

Cats with hemorrhaging or a severely low platelet count are typically hospitalized and given a platelet-rich plasma transfusion to restore their platelet count to normal.

Bloodwork is repeated every few weeks after a transfusion to recheck the platelet count to see if the level remains normal or decreases again over time. Medications to stimulate platelet production—such as vincristine and erythropoietin—may be prescribed. 

Recovery and Management of Low Platelets in Cats
Recovery depends on the underlying cause, the severity of the disease, and your cat’s response to treatment.

It’s ideal to keep a cat with a low platelet count indoors and minimize their activity level, as even a minor injury could lead to uncontrollable bleeding.

Monitor your cat’s skin regularly to make sure that any bruises are fading and new bruises are not forming. Also observe your cat’s food and water intake, energy level, and their urination and defecation to determine if they are normal or abnormal during their recovery. 

Some infectious diseases—such as ehrlichiosis and mycoplasmosis—are treatable in roughly four weeks. However, other causes of a low platelet count in cats—such as heartworm disease and feline leukemia—have no curable treatment option.

Immune-mediated disease will require frequent blood work to determine if immunosuppressive medications can be tapered off over time. Treatment for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia can take several months or may even be lifelong. 

Prevention of Low Platelets in Cats
Some causes for low platelets can be prevented. Here are some recommendations for protecting your cat:


	
	Administer heartworm, flea, and tick prevention year-round to protect your cat against heartworms, ehrlichiosis, cytauxzoonosis, and mycoplasmosis.
	
	
	Keep rodenticide far out of your cat’s reach or do not use it at all.
	
	
	Keep your cat indoors to reduce their risk of infectious diseases.
	
	
	Do not feed a raw diet to your cat, as this can increase the risk of salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis.
	
	
	Keep your cat up to date on their feline leukemia and feline distemper vaccinations.
	
	
	Report any adverse side effects to your veterinarian when giving oral medications to your cat.
	
	
	If you’re getting a kitten from a breeder, choose a reputable breeder who ensures their breeding cats and kittens are negative for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus.  Also have your kitten tested for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus at your local veterinary hospital.
	
	
	Have routine blood work done on your cat every six to 12 months for screening.
	


Some causes of a low platelet count are not preventable, such as immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and cancer.
Low Platelets in Cats FAQsWhat is a normal platelet count for cats?A cat’s platelet count should typically range from approximately 200,000 to 600,000 per microliter, though variations can occur based on the reference lab used.
What causes platelet clumping in cats?Platelet clumping may result from the anticoagulant within the blood collection tube. If clumping occurs, it can lead to a falsely low platelet count (pseudothrombocytopenia).

Adhering to proper blood collection techniques can minimize the risk of platelet clumping.

275,Lower Eyelid Drooping in Cats,"Ectropion in Cats

Ectropion is a condition which describes the margin of the eyelid rolling outward, resulting in exposure of the sensitive tissue (conjunctiva) lining the inside of the eyelid. Exposure and poor tear distribution may predispose the patient to sight-threatening corneal disease.

It occurs most commonly in dogs but is rarely seen in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Protrusion of the lower eyelid — with lack of contact of the lower lid to the eye globe, and exposure of the palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva and the third eyelid — can usually be plainly seen. Other signs and symptoms include:


    Facial      staining caused by poor tear drainage (i.e., tears spill over onto the      face instead of passing from the eye to the nose via the tear ducts)
    Excess      eye discharge due to conjunctival exposure
    Recurrent      foreign object irritation
    History      of bacterial conjunctivitis      (inflammation of the conjunctiva)


Causes

Ectroprion in cats is usually secondary to breed-associated alterations in facial conformation and eyelid support. The condition is seen more frequently in Persians and Himalayans. Other possible causes include:

    Marked      weight loss or muscle mass of the head and eye orbits
    Scarring      of the eyelids secondary to injury, or after overcorrection of entropion (a      medical condition in which the eyelids fold inward)

  
Diagnosis

A thorough eye exam will be conducted to look for evidence of the eyelid malformation and for corneal ulcerations. A fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions or foreign objects. In cats with late-age onset, an underlying disorder will be considered as a causative factor. Nerve paralysis in the eye, a condition associated with lack of muscle tone of the eye muscles, will be considered.



Treatment

Your veterinarian will prescribe supportive care in the form of a topical lubricant, or an antibiotic-containing ointment, along with good eye and facial hygiene, which should be sufficient for most mild forms of the disease. Surgical treatment may be required to shorten the eyelid, and for severely affected patients with chronic ocular (eye) irritation, a radical face lift may need to be performed to correct the disorder. Your veterinarian will help you to develop a treatment plan to treat both the symptoms and any underlying conditions.

Living and Management

This condition may become more severe as your cat ages, and will need to be monitored by your veterinarian on a regular basis so that infections, should they occur, do not become severe, and related eye disorders can be treated with immediacy.

Protrusion of the lower eyelid — with lack of contact of the lower lid to the eye globe, and exposure of the palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva and the third eyelid — can usually be plainly seen. Other signs and symptoms include:


    Facial      staining caused by poor tear drainage (i.e., tears spill over onto the      face instead of passing from the eye to the nose via the tear ducts)
    Excess      eye discharge due to conjunctival exposure
    Recurrent      foreign object irritation
    History      of bacterial conjunctivitis      (inflammation of the conjunctiva)

276,Low Blood Potassium in Cats,"Hypokalemia in Cats



A cat with abnormally low concentrations of potassium in the blood is said to have hypokalemia. A vital element to an important group of blood minerals called electrolytes, potassium functions in both cellular and electricual functions, such as in the conduction of electrical charges in the heart, nerves, and muscles. Therefore, lower levels of potassium in the bloodstream will compromise the normal functioning ability of these tissues.



Potassium is a vital element of both electrical and cellular functions. It belongs to an important group of blood minerals called electrolytes, which means it can carry small electrical charges. This primary positive ion is found within the cells and has a very important role in maintaining normal fluid levels within the cells and normal functions of many of the other enzymes within cells. Being an electrolyte that can carry a charge, potassium serves an important function in the conduction of electrical charges in the heart, nerves and muscles.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms relate to the underlying cause of hypokalemia. Some of the more common ones include:




	Vomiting
	Lethargy
	Lack of appetite
	Weight loss
	Muscle pain
	Loss of muscle mass
	Generalized muscular weakness
	Downward dropping of neck
	Paralysis of muscles involve in respirations, causing difficulty in breathing
	Increased urination (polyuria)
	Increased thirst (polydipsia)




Causes




	Potassium loss through urine
	Chronic kidney disease
	After administration of drug meant to increase urine output
	Patients on dialysis
	Increased loss through urine after administration of intravenous fluids
	Metabolic diseases
	Vomiting
	After use of certain antibiotics
	Loss of potassium through feces, such as with diarrhea
	Intestinal obstruction
	Insufficient potassium intake
	Prolonged loss of appetite or starvation
	Diet deficient in potassium
	Insulin administration
	Glucose administration
	Stress induced




  



Diagnosis



You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents or conditions that might have led to this condition.



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems. Routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis are important for the diagnosis of hypokalemia and its underlying cause. In chronic kidney failure patients, blood tests may reveal normochromic (hemoglobin contents of RBCs are normal), normocytic (overall hemoglobin levels are decreased), and nonregenerative (bone marrow responding inadequately to the increased demand of RBC) anemia.



Higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (waste products [urea] in the blood that are normally excreted in the urine and voided from the body) and creatinine may also be found in patients with hypokalemia due to kidney failure. Urinalysis may reveal inadequate urine concentrating ability in patients with chronic kidney failure. In diabetic patients, the urinalysis may reveal high glucose levels and ketone bodies in urine.



Abdominal X-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT-Scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to diagnose the underlying cause of hypokalemia.





Treatment



Your cat may need to be hospitalized if its condition is severe enough to warrant an emergency. The initial treatment includes supplementation of potassium and treatment to stabilize dangerous symptoms like irregular heart beating and paralysis of respiratory muscles. Once your cat has been stabilized, maintenance dosages of potassium will be administrated. Once the underlying disease has been diagnosed, it can be treated to prevent another episode of hypokalemia.



Living and Management



Your cat's potassium levels may need to be measured every 6 to 24 hours during the initial phase of treatment. Call your veterinarian if you see any change in symptom at home during treatment."," and Types

277,Low Blood Oxygen in Cats,"Hypoxemia in Cats

Hypoxemia occurs when the blood in the arteries is not being oxygenated sufficiently. The condition is dangerous in cats because the oxygen that is vital for the functioning of all the organs is adversely affected. The brain can suffer irreversible damage when deprived of oxygen for even relatively short periods of time. Oxygen deficiency may also lead to anemia and/or hypoxia in the organs, which can progress to arrhythmia and heart failure. This is a serious condition that needs to be treated quickly.

Symptoms and Types


    Coughing
    Difficulty 	breathing
    Shortness 	of breath
    Abnormally 	rapid breathing (tachypnea)
    Open-mouthed 	breathing
    Rapid 	heartbeat (tachycardia)
    Pain
    Gagging
    Inability 	to endure exercise
    Discoloration 	of skin and mucous membranes

    Pneumonia
    Disease 	of the lining of the lungs
    Anesthesia
    Heart 	disease
    Lung 	disease
    Feline 	asthma
    Lung 	or heart disease in elderly animals


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by the lack of oxygen. Your veterinarian will be looking for abnormal breathing, over-excitement, and anxiousness in your cat. Elevated body temperature and an examination for any head injuries will also be vital for making an accurate diagnosis. Samples of blood will be drawn for profiling and diagnostic purposes, and blood gas analyzers will be used for measuring levels of oxygen in the arterial blood.

In addition, X-rays and echocardiograms can be employed to rule out lung and heart diseases as the cause of the oxygen deficiency in the blood. If the cause cannot be determined by any of these methods, an endoscopy or biopsy of the lung may be performed.



Treatment

Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause of the oxygen deficiency. Oxygen is usually given to support your cat's heart and lungs (cardiovascular system); the oxygen is delivered using a face mask placed securely around the muzzle. However, it is important to keep in mind that this treatment is not always successful.

If the problem is low cardiac output, intravenous (IV) medications to strengthen muscle action will be prescribed. In case of cardiac failure, diuretics and oxygen will be administered, as well as medications to strengthen muscle action.

If there is hemorrhaging, injury, or shock from infection, hospitalization will be required so that an IV can be inserted and fluids brought into the veins to stabilize the body. This will also allow oxygen to reach appropriate levels.

Living and Management

Hypoxemia is a life-threatening condition. Therefore, observe your cat carefully following treatment. Symptoms to watch out for are a decreased ability to breathe, as well any paleness of the tissues (such as the tissues of the mouth and gums), which would signal lack of oxygen diffusion in the tissues. Frequent follow-up visits with your veterinarian will be needed for arterial blood gas measurements."," and Types

278,Low Blood Calcium in Cats,"Hypocalcemia in Cats



The term ""hypocalcemia"" refers to abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood. This mineral plays an important role in vital bodily functions such as bone and teeth formation, blood clotting, milk production, muscle contraction, heart pumping, vision, and in the metabolism of hormones and enzymes. Therefore, calcium deficiency is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the problem. However, some of the more common symptoms include:




	Muscle twitching and trembling
	Uncoordinated or stiff gait
	Panting
	Face rubbing against objects
	Vomiting
	Lack of appetite
	Fever
	Weakness




In mild cases, no symptoms may be observed until total calcium level fall well below normal (6.7 mg/dL).



Causes



Albumin is a protein found in the blood and significant fraction of calcium remains bound to albumin along with free calcium in the blood. If the level of albumin falls (hypoalbuminemia) due to some other problem or disease, it also affects the total calcium level. Although it accounts for more than 50 percent of hypocalcemia cases, low levels of calcium associated with hypoalbuminemia are not generally associated with any symptom.



Hypocalcemia may also be due to:




	Kidney failure (acute or chronic)
	Poor calcium absorption in the gut
	Alkalosis (condition in which the body fluids have excess base alkali)
	Hypoparathyroidism (Inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone resulting in abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood)
	Hypoparathyroidism secondary to surgical removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy)
	Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism
	Oxalate toxicity (e.g., lily, philodendron, etc.)
	Hypomagnesaemia (low levels of magnesium in the blood)
	Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas)
	Rickets (early age disease caused by deficiency of vitamin D and sunlight associated with impaired metabolism of calcium and phosphorus)
	Puerperal tetany (Clinical neurological syndrome characterized by muscular twitching and cramps and seizures; associated with calcium deficiency [hypoparathyroidism] or vitamin D deficiency or alkalosis)
	Phosphate-containing enemas used in patients with severe constipation
	Citrate toxicity in patients with multiple blood transfusions were conducted for some other health problem






Diagnosis



There are occasions where a laboratory error reflects hypocalcemia when in fact your cat is just fine. To verify, it is important you give a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidence that might have precipitated the condition. Your veterinarian will also perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems to evaluate overall health of your cat. Routine tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will provide valuable information about the blood calcium levels and information about the possible inciting cause(s) of hypocalcemia in your cat.



If kidney failure is the precipitating cause of hypocalcemia, complete blood count may show anemia in cats with chronic kidney failure. Anemia may also be present in patients with nutrition related secondary hyperparathyroidism or poor intestinal absorption of calcium in the gut.



In case of infection or inflammation (like pancreatitis), the number of white blood cells may have found to be abnormally high. In cats patients with pancreatitis, amylase and lipase enzymes are also found to be elevated. In cats with low levels of albumin (hypoalbuminemia), the biochemistry profile will show levels of albumin and disturbances in calcium levels. Meanwhile, if alkalosis is a cause of hypocalcemia, the blood gas analysis will reveal abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood of your cat.



Cats with with kidney failure, ethylene glycol toxicity, or oxalate toxicity may present abnormally high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Phosphorous derangements are also common in conditions leading to low calcium levels and in patients with kidney problems, ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, and hypoparathyroidism, biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of phosphorous. High phosphorous levels and hypocalcemia may also be found in the blood if enemas containing phosphorous are used in patients requiring enema; in constipation, for example. Urinalysis may reveal abnormally low concentrated urine and presence of glucose in patients with kidney problems or ethylene or oxalate toxicity.



To determine if the low level of calcium is responsible for the symptoms present, your veterinarian may order further testing to find the concentration of ionized fractions of calcium, which is the active form of calcium in the blood. In case of ethylene glycol toxicity, the ethylene glycol test will be performed to confirm the toxicity. Your veterinarian will draw a blood sample from a vein of your cat and will send it to the laboratory to determine the levels of ethylene glycol in the blood. Normally, the level of ethylene glycol in the blood should be zero. If hypoparathyroidism is suspected, more detailed tests to evaluate the functions of the parathyroid gland will be conducted.



Radiography of the abdomen may reveal smaller than normal sized kidneys in cats with chronic kidney failure and large-sized kidney in animals with ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, or acute kidney failure. Cats with nutrition related secondary hypoparathyroidism, meanwhile, may display low bone density on bone X-rays.







Treatment



Generally, hypocalcemia is corrected through calcium supplementation therapy under close monitoring, so as to prevent side-effects related to calcium overload. Your veterinarian will also monitor the electrocardiogram data (EKG) because calcium has a direct effect on heart and significant calcium level changes leads to abnormal EKG findings.



After intravenous calcium therapy, your veterinarian may like to continue calcium supplementation for an extended period of time to prevent relapse. In addition, severe cases of hypocalcemia may require extended hospital stays.



Living and Management



In cases with transitory hypocalcemia, the initial calcium therapy will generally resolve the problem. However, if the hypocalcemia was due to a serious health problem, it will need to be treated further to prevent future episodes. Hypocalcemia due to nutrition and parturition (the act of giving birth) may also require further action.



If your cat's hypocalcemia is related to nutrition, for example, your veterinarian will make new dietary recommendations. While mothers that have recently given birth may be separated from their kittens. In these cases, the kittens can be nursed by hand until the cat's hypocalcemia has properly been addressed."," and Types



Symptoms vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the problem. However, some of the more common symptoms include:




	Muscle twitching and trembling
	Uncoordinated or stiff gait
	Panting
	Face rubbing against objects
	Vomiting
	Lack of appetite
	Fever
	Weakness




In mild cases, no symptoms may be observed until total calcium level fall well below normal (6.7 mg/dL).

279,Low Blood Albumin in Cats,"Hypoalbuminemia in Cats

 

Hypoalbuminemia is a condition in which the levels of albumin in the cat's blood serum are abnormally low. A protein formed in the liver and carried into the blood, albumin is responsible for regulating blood volume by controlling pressure in the blood compartment. It is also important for retaining fluid in the vascular compartment. TTherefore, a deficiency of albumin can pose grave risks for a cat, including dangerous fluid buildup.



Hypoalbuminemia has not been found to occur at any particular age. Moreover, there are no apparent breed or gender predilections.



Symptoms and Types

 


	Abdominal distention
	Diarrhea and/or vomiting
	Difficulty breathing
	Swollen limbs
	Generalized swelling


 

 

Causes

 


	Chronic liver disease: chronic hepatitis; cirrhosis
	Inadequate fluid or food intake - malnutrition/malassimilation
	Amyloidosis (insoluble proteins are deposited in organs)
	Glomerulonephritis (a primary or secondary immune-mediated renal disease)
	Lymphoma
	Severe inflammatory bowel disease
	Histoplasmosis (fungal disease)
	Oozing sores on the skin
	Chronic severe blood loss
	Repeated large volume of fluid in the abdomen
	Inflammatory effusions:
	
		Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
		Peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdomen)
		Chylous effusions (milky bodily fluid consisting of lymph and emulsified fats flowing into cavities where it is not intended to be)
		Pyothorax (infection in the chest). 
		Vasculopathies (diseases of the blood vessels)
		Immune mediated
	
	


 



Diagnosis

 

Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.



Before your veterinarian can determine an effective treatment plan, the underlying cause of the low albumin count in your cat's blood stream will need to be conclusively identified. For example, if the cause is severe liver disease, your cat may have all of the symptoms listed. A complete blood analysis and urinalysis will help your doctor to zero in on the cause. Chest and abdominal X-rays may also be required, as well as ultrasound and liver and kidney biopsies.   





Treatment

 

Your cat's treatment will be dictated by the cause of the low albumin counts. Your cat may need to be hospitalized initially for treatment. If there is a fluid buildup in the chest, for instance, a chest tube may be inserted to relieve some of the buildup. Intravenous fluids may be required as well. Likewise, the type of medication prescribed will depend on the underlying cause of the albumin deficiency.



Your veterinarian may prescribe physical therapy to include walks in order to improve drainage of peripheral swelling. A specific diet will also be planned once your cat is able to eat normally again.

 

Living and Management

 

Your veterinarian will need to see your cat frequently in the early stages of treatment to monitor body weight and fluid buildup, and to take blood samples and monitor albumin concentrations. Making sure that the heart is functioning properly, and recovering from any stress that occurred as a result of the albumin disorder, is also essential.

280,Loss of Hair in Cats,"Alopecia is the medical term for hair loss in cats. This is a common problem for cats and can have a variety of possible causes. In many cases, there is more than one contributing cause, making the problem frustrating for pet parents to figure out and eliminate.

Some types of cat hair loss involve the hair falling out spontaneously, while others are caused by cats overgrooming, biting, or scratching themselves. Occasionally, alopecia is nothing to worry about, such as the small areas of hair loss many cats develop in the area between their ears and eyes. Other times, it can be a symptom of serious underlying disease.

Cat alopecia can be broken down into two types:


	
	Congenital alopecia occurs most often in newborn kittens or young cats, and it does not cause them to be itchy. This is usually related to your cat’s breed or genetics.
	
	
	Acquired alopecia occurs in cats that are born with normal hair coats and lose hair because of an underlying systemic illness or skin disease. It can occur at any age and there are many possible causes, ranging from an infection with parasites like mites, to an allergy, or a metabolic disease like hyperthyroidism. These cats may or may not be itchy, depending on the underlying cause.

Other Symptoms to Check For With Hair Loss in Cats
Cats with alopecia can have patches of hair loss in one area of the body or in multiple areas. The locations vary based on the underlying cause of hair loss. Cat alopecia may be inflammatory or non-inflammatory, meaning that the skin may appear red and irritated, or it may appear normal.

Cats with inflammatory alopecia may show a number of symptoms:


	
	Be obviously itchy and seem to lick, bite, gnaw, and scratch at their skin more than normal.
	
	
	Experience an increase in hairballs.
	
	
	Have other skin abnormalities such as redness, bumps, scabs, sores, or crusts.
	


It is important to note that just because you don’t see signs of itchiness, that doesn’t mean your cat is not itchy. Often, cats hide those behaviors, only to gnaw and scratch when they are hidden from view.

If there is an underlying systemic disease affecting your cat, you may see these signs:


	
	Changes in appetite
	
	
	Vomiting and/or diarrhea
	
	
	Changes in energy level
	
	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Enlarged abdomen or a pot-belly appearance
	


Cats with allergies may also experience additional symptoms:


	
	Conjunctivitis
	
	
	Inflammation of the ears
	


Causes of Hair Loss on a Cat
There are multiple causes of congenital alopecia. 


	
	Alopecia universalis is a condition in which the cat is born without hair. While hairlessness is a feature of some breeds (e.g., Sphinx, Elf, Delf cats), there is a genetic mutation that makes this type of alopecia possible in any cat breed.
	
	
	Hereditary hypotrichosis is when a cat is born with a thin coat of hair, then loses it over time. This is more commonly seen in Siamese, Devon Rex, Birman, and Burmese cats.
	
	
	Follicular dysplasia takes place when cats are born with a full coat of hair that thins over time. Cornish Rex breeds are predisposed to this.
	


There are many potential causes of acquired alopecia in cats, and the problem may be the result of one or more of the following:


	
	Infection caused by bacteria (most commonly Staphylococcus), yeast (usually Malassezia), ringworm, or parasites (e.g., Demodex, Cheyletiella, Notoedres, or Otodectes mites).
	
	
	Allergies to fleas, food, or environmental allergens.
	
	
	Discomfort caused by another disease, such as inflammation in the bladder, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, or anal sacs.
	
	
	Endocrine disease like hyperthyroidism (common) or Cushing’s disease (rare in cats).
	
	
	Recent metabolic stress, such as pregnancy, nursing, or fever.
	
	
	Cancers, including cutaneous lymphoma, thymoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and bile duct carcinoma.
	
	
	An immune-mediated disease, like alopecia areata (extremely rare).
	
	
	Psychogenic alopecia, a behavioral issue in which the cat overgrooms due to compulsion and anxiety. 
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Hair Loss
It is important to take appropriate steps to identify the underlying cause of your cat’s alopecia. The first step in diagnosis is a detailed history. Details like the age of your cat and whether it’s on prescription flea prevention, seems itchy, experiences seasonal skin issues, or has had any recent stressors helps your vet determine the proper plan of treatment.  

The next step is a physical exam performed by your veterinarian. The location of the cat’s alopecia is often a clue for what the underlying cause may be. For example, the base of the tail and lower back is often affected in cats with flea issues. Anal gland issues can cause irritation around the anus below the tail, and a cat with psychogenic alopecia will not have hair loss on its neck or face.

Your veterinarian will likely perform one or more diagnostic tests:


	
	Wood’s lamp: This test detects some occurrences of ringworm infection.
	



	
	Fungal culture: A veterinarian may perform a ringworm culture in-house or send a sample to an outside laboratory. It can take several days to get these results.
	
	
	Cytology: A skin impression or tape sample is viewed under a microscope to determine bacteria or yeast.
	
	
	Skin scraping: A scrape can be used to look for parasites, such as mites.
	
	
	Skin biopsy: If the appearance of the cat’s skin is unusual or other tests do not provide a diagnosis, a veterinarian may perform a punch biopsy—or surgically remove—a small area of skin for a pathologist to view.
	
	
	Bloodwork and urinalysis: These tests may be recommended to evaluate for an endocrine disorder (such as hyperthyroidism) or other underlying systemic diseases.
	
	
	Allergy testing: Your veterinarian may recommend an elimination diet trial using prescription food for 8 to 12 weeks to test for a food allergy. The vet may also recommend intradermal allergen testing if other causes of alopecia have been ruled out and the vet thinks your cat could have an environmental allergy.
	
	
	Imaging: An ultrasound and/or X-rays may be used to look for signs of cancer.
	


Psychogenic alopecia is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that it can only be definitively diagnosed after other causes have been ruled out. It is more likely if there have been changes to the cat’s environment, like new pets, visiting family members, moving, or other stressors.

Treatment of Hair Loss in Cats
Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of your pet’s hair loss. Use of an Elizabethan collar (e-collar) may be recommended if your pet is licking or biting the skin. The collar helps prevent infection and allows the hair to regrow.

Possible treatments may include:


	
	Parasiticide treatment (e.g., Revolution, Bravecto, Credelio), which may be prescribed for eight weeks for all pets in the house. This is recommended even if no parasites are found on exam, as cats are excellent groomers and may effectively remove most of the parasites from their hair coat before you see them.
	
	
	Topical therapy which may include medicated shampoo, mousse, or ointment.
	
	
	Systemic antibiotics and/or antifungals.
	
	
	Elimination diet trial for 8 to 12 weeks with a prescription allergy diet or a limited-ingredient diet.
	
	
	Medications such as prednisolone, cyclosporine, and/or antihistamines to reduce itch.
	
	
	Behavior-modifying medication (such as fluoxetine) and environmental enrichment, including improved access to resources (food, water, litter box), playtime, and interactive toys.
	


Recovery and Management of Cat Alopecia
Recovery time for cats with alopecia depends on the underlying cause, and it may take weeks to several months. If the underlying cause is identified and appropriate treatment is pursued, your cat’s hair will likely grow back.

Many diagnoses will require long-term management such as year-round flea prevention, prescription cat food, regular use of topical therapies, and/or consistent use of medication. It is important to work closely with your veterinarian and follow instructions for follow-up visits to achieve the best possible outcome.
Cat Alopecia FAQsCan alopecia in cats be cured?Most cases of alopecia can be cured if appropriate steps are taken to diagnose and treat the underlying cause.
Do cat bald spots grow back?Bald spots on cats typically grow back after the underlying cause is addressed. For shorthaired cats, hair may grow back in a matter of weeks, but it may take several months for other cats.
How do I know if my cat has alopecia?Your cat has alopecia if you notice areas of hair that are thinner than the rest of the haircoat. This is different from shedding, a normal process that does not cause visible areas of hair thinning or baldness.

281,Lockjaw in Cats,"Tetanus Bacillus Infection in Cats

Tetanus is a rare disease in cats, the result of a bacterium called Clostridium tetani. This bacterium is normally present in soil and other low oxygen environments, but also in the intestines of mammals and in the dead tissue of the wounds that are created due to injury, surgery, burns, frostbite, and fractures.

One typical feature of this bacterium is that it can live without oxygen (anaerobic) and can remain in the environment for long periods by forming spores. Once favorable conditions are present, such as an injured animal coming into contact with the spores, they are able to release the potent toxin into the body. These potent toxins bind to nerve cells in the body and generate symptoms that are characteristic of this disease, such as muscle spasms and stiffening of the limbs.

The severity of the symptoms will often depend on the number of organisms that are able to enter the body and the quantity of toxins produced in the body, but this is generally considered a serious condition warranting immediate treatment.

Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms can appear after spores have entered the wound and germinated. The muscles around the infected wound may become rigid first. The animal may appear stiff and lame. Weakness and an uncoordinated gait can usually be observed in these animals. The symptoms may then disappear spontaneously in some animals if the infection remains local to the area in which it entered the body, while in other animals the symptoms can escalate to a generalized disease if the toxins are able to gain access to the nervous system.

The symptoms related to generalized disease are:


    Fever
    Constipation
    Pain during urination
    Excessive drooling
    Wrinkled forehead
    Grinning appearance
    Stiff and hard tail
    Continuously erect and stiff ears
    Progressive stiffness of the body muscles, giving the animal a sawhorse appearance
    Difficulty eating
    Breathing difficulty (due to stiffness of the chest muscles)
    Difficulty opening the mouth (due to stiffness of the jaw muscles)
    Whole body muscle spasms with sudden external movement, sound, or touch
    Paralysis
    Death due to inability to breathe


Causes

Because unattended wounds leading to bacterial contamination is the leading cause of lockjaw, outdoor cats are at higher risk.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms. Your veterinarian will also ask about any previous injuries or traumas that might have led to the infection. After taking the detailed history, your veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination on your cat.

Routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The complete blood count may show an abnormally low or high number of white blood cells (WBCs), both indicating infection. Biochemistry testing may reveal high concentrations of an enzyme called creatine phosphokinase (CPK). This enzyme is mainly found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, but the level of this enzyme increases in the blood in response to the stiffness and damage the muscles are experiencing, which are in turn responding to the bacterial infection.

The results of the urinalysis are often normal except for an increase of myoglobin in the urine. Myoglobin is a protein that is normally found in the muscles, and with constant contractions and stiffness of muscles, it starts appearing in the urine due to its release from the damaged muscles. Your veterinarian will also send samples of tissue and fluid that has been taken from the wound to the laboratory for culture. Culture testing will allow for the controlled growing of the causative organism, thereby confirming its presence in the wound.



Treatment

In advanced stages of this disease, your cat will need to be hospitalized. Good support and constant nursing is usually required for a period of 3-4 weeks. If your cat is not able to eat on its own, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube directly into its stomach in order to maintain its energy and metabolic needs. Because this toxin attacks the muscles and nervous system, these animals are very sensitive, making forced feedings an undesirable treatment method. Such manipulations may, in fact, exacerbate the symptoms. Intravenous fluids may be started to prevent dehydration. That will be one of the primary concerns.

One of the important aspects of nursing care is to keep the cat in an environment of low light and low noise, as these animals are extremely sensitive to touch, sound, and light.

Your cat will be kept sedated to prevent further aggravation of the symptoms. Drugs can be used to minimize the muscle spasm and convulsions. In combination, these types of drugs will encourage your cat to remain in a lying position for extended periods. Because of this, there is a concern for the side effects of lying in one place for too long. You should provide your cat with soft bedding, and you will need to schedule regular times throughout the day when you can turn your cat over to its other side, to prevent bed sores/ulcers from developing.

In the event that your cat is not able to breathe properly, a tube will be placed into the trachea to facilitate normal breathing until the muscles have recovered from the infection. In some animals, a hole has to be made into the trachea to facilitate breathing and prevent asphyxia. If your cat is not able to pass urine, a urinary catheter will be placed to allow for the passage of urine. If your cat is constipated, an enema can be given to relieve constipation. These treatments may be applied in the home environment, in many cases. The most important consideration is the ability to maintain a sterile environment for the cat, if it is going to be receiving home treatment after the initial in-clinic care. You will need to discuss this with your veterinarian and go over the proper procedures for avoiding contamination.

Drugs will be given to bind the toxin and prevent its further binding to the nerve cells. Antibiotics will also also given, either orally or by injection, to control further spread of the infection. Topical (outer) antibiotics will also be used around the periphery of the wound to control infection.

Living and Management

Once your cat is out of danger, you’ll be allowed to take it back home where you will need to provide good nursing care until your cat has had a full recovery from the infection and its side effects. Your veterinarian will brief you on the correct usage of the various tubes that will need to be placed in your cat's body, including the stomach tube for daily feeding.

As mentioned above, it is important to change your cat's resting position every few hours to prevent ulcers. Keep the wound clear and visit your veterinarian if you see any change in the color of the wound or if ulcers start appearing. Otherwise, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.

You will need to visit your veterinarian a few more times to have your cat examined and to evaluate its recovery status. The prognosis largely depends on the severity of the disease; the more severe the disease, the less are the chances for a full recovery. Good owner compliance is required as these animals often need a long period of time for a full recovery. A strong commitment from your side will greatly improve your cat's chances for survival."," and Types
 
Symptoms can appear after spores have entered the wound and germinated. The muscles around the infected wound may become rigid first. The animal may appear stiff and lame. Weakness and an uncoordinated gait can usually be observed in these animals. The symptoms may then disappear spontaneously in some animals if the infection remains local to the area in which it entered the body, while in other animals the symptoms can escalate to a generalized disease if the toxins are able to gain access to the nervous system.

The symptoms related to generalized disease are:


    Fever
    Constipation
    Pain during urination
    Excessive drooling
    Wrinkled forehead
    Grinning appearance
    Stiff and hard tail
    Continuously erect and stiff ears
    Progressive stiffness of the body muscles, giving the animal a sawhorse appearance
    Difficulty eating
    Breathing difficulty (due to stiffness of the chest muscles)
    Difficulty opening the mouth (due to stiffness of the jaw muscles)
    Whole body muscle spasms with sudden external movement, sound, or touch
    Paralysis
    Death due to inability to breathe

282,Lizard Bite Poisoning in Cats,"Lizard Venom Toxicity in Cats

In terms of lizards, the Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the Mexican Beaded Lizard (H. horridum) are the only ones to be seriously concerned about. These lizards live almost exclusively in the American Southwest and Mexico.

While Gila Monsters and Mexican Beaded Lizards are normally docile and do not often attack, it is important to be aware of the danger if a bite does occur. These lizards have a tendency to bite hard and not let go. In order to release its bite, use a prying instrument to open the lizard's jaws. It has also been found that a flame held under the lizard’s jaw will cause it let go.

These lizards have about forty teeth, which are grooved and not attached to the jaws very firmly, allowing them to be broken off and regrown throughout their lives. There are two glands in the back of the lower jaw where the venom is stored in a pocket next to the outside teeth and then released through a duct when the lizard bites. The venom is then projected along the grooves of the teeth and into the victim. Salivation increases with the intensity of the anger of the lizard. When that occurs, the amount of venom injected into the victim also increases. Statistically, venom from bites will be deposited into a cat about 70 percent of the time.

The venom of the two lizards is very similar. However, in contrast to the venom of most snakes, it does not have an anticoagulant effect. Even so, it has been shown in lab tests to be just as potent as some rattlesnake venoms.

Symptoms and Types of Lizard Venom Toxicity


    Bleeding      from the wound
    Low      blood pressure
    Swelling
    Excessive      salivation
    Tearing      of the eyes
    Frequent      urination and defecation
    Weakness
    Irregular      heart rhythm
    Extreme      pain at the wound site
    Loss      of voice


Diagnosis of Lizard Venom Toxicity

Blood analyses, urinalyses, X-rays, and ultrasound results are usually normal but may be performed to rule out other diseases if the cause is in doubt. An EKG (electrocardiogram) to check for irregular heart rhythm will likely be necessary. Your cat’s blood pressure will also need to be checked.



Treatment for Lizard Venom Toxicity


    Open      the jaws of the lizard if it’s still attached
    If the      cat’s blood pressure is dangerously low or if the heart rhythms are      abnormal, intravenous (IV) drugs will be administered to treat the      arrhythmia
    Flush      and soak the wound
    If      there are any remnants of the lizard’s teeth left behind in the skin,      remove them
    Control      pain
    Treat      with prophylactic antibiotics


Living and Management of Lizard Venom Toxicity

The cat must be taken to a veterinarian if you suspect it has been bitten by one of these lizards. The veterinarian will then prescribe treatment and medications. Pay close attention to the wound and report any changes. Most importantly, if you live in an area where these lizards are likely to roam, keep your cat confined to avoid exposure."," and Types of Lizard Venom Toxicity

283,Liver Tumor (Hepatocellular Adenoma) in Cats,"Hepatocellular Adenoma in Cats
 
Hepatocellular adenoma is a benign tumor involving the liver cells. It stems from an over-growth of epithelial cells, which are used for secretion in the body. Fortunately, this type of tumor is very rare in cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Mostly no symptoms are obvious in affected animals, though a rupture of a tumor mass may result in blood accumulation in the abdomen. The following are symptoms of hepatocellular adenoma in cats:
 

    Weakness
    Abdominal pain
    Vomiting
    Poor appetite

 
Causes
 
The exact cause is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your cat’s veterinarian will take a detailed history from you and perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, where results are usually normal. In few animals these results may show anemia and abnormally high levels of liver enzymes. Radiographic studies may show a mass in the liver. Similarly, ultrasonography helps in diagnosis, revealing masses, hemorrhage, and other abnormalities.
 
Your veterinarian will also take a small sample of the tumor mass under ultrasound guidance. After processing, your veterinarian will observe the sample under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. 
 

 
Treatment
 
Surgery may be attempted to excise the tumor along with some normal tissue. A large portion of the liver can be removed if required. If the tumor is bleeding, a blood transfusion may be required for your cat. Other symptomatic treatment is conducted to minimize discomfort related to this disease.
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will perform regular checkups every three to four months to check for recurrence. Laboratory testing may also be conducted on a regular basis to see the status of the tumor. Abdominal ultrasound is an excellent tool for evaluating the status of the tumor. As benign in nature, complete excision of the tumor mass will lead to an excellent recovery in most cases."," and Types

284,Liver Toxins in Cats,"Hepatotoxins in Cats
 
Hepatotoxins are toxic substance that can damage the liver. Some toxins are known for having properties that can bring about liver damage and that almost always lead to liver toxicity. However, an individual cat may be more likely to develop liver toxicity symptoms that are related to a particular drug than another cat might under seemingly similar circumstances. This type of reaction is called an ""idiosyncratic reaction"" and can sometimes lead to unpredictable injury.
 
The liver is the largest gland in the body, and one of the most important organs for the overall health of the body. It serves many vital functions, like production of bile (the fluid substance that helps in fat digestion), production of albumin (a protein present in blood plasma), and more importantly, the detoxification of chemicals and drugs that pass through the body.
 
In comparison to other organs the liver is more susceptible to adverse toxicity reactions, due to its location and to its central role in the metabolism of toxic chemicals and drugs. Liver toxicity is most commonly reported as being associated with adverse drug reactions. The severity of the liver toxicity is also determined by the age, species, nutritional status, concurrent diseases, hereditary factors, other drugs being used, and previous exposure to the same or similar drugs. The extent of liver injury also depends on drug concentration, duration and frequency of drug exposure, and current liver health status.
 
Siamese cats are at higher risk for developing liver toxicity. Though liver toxicity can occur in cats of any age, young cats are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions and liver damage due to their immature liver metabolism and excretory functions.
 
Symptoms and Types

 
Symptoms can vary depending on the duration of drug exposure and the type of toxin. The following symptoms may be observed in cats with liver toxicity:
 

    Loss of appetite
    Severe physical discomfort
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Jaundice (often progressive)
    Weakness
    Fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites) - this symptom is often indicative of advanced disease
    Coma
    Hemorrhages
    Petechia (minute red or purple spots on the surface of the skin as the result of tiny hemorrhages of blood vessels in the skin)
    Ecchymosis (the escape of blood from ruptured blood vessels into the surrounding tissue, forming a purple or black-and-blue spot on the skin)

 
Causes
 


    Drugs
    Toxic chemicals

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition, such as prior health condition, any medications your cat has been on, etc. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of the body systems, and to evaluate the overall health of your cat. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These test results should allow your veterinarian to make an initial diagnosis. The biochemistry profile will reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes due to liver injury.
 
Creatine kinase, an enzyme in the tissues, will show increased levels in the blood in cases with severe muscle damage, and as certain chemicals are toxic to the muscles, its levels are also determined in animals with liver toxicity. In patients with liver toxicity, the blood protein albumin may also show increased levels. The urinalysis may indicate high levels of glucose (sugar) in the urine if kidney damage is also present. Because the liver also performs a pivotal role in blood clotting, in cases of liver damage the normal blood clotting functions may be disturbed. For this reason your veterinarian will likely order a complete blood clotting profile test for your cat.
 
Abdominal X-rays and ultrasonography may be used to evaluate the size of the liver along with the extent of damage. Your veterinarian may also need to take a sample of liver tissue for a liver biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the level of damage. Your veterinarian will require three to five days to assess a realistic prognosis of liver damage in your cat so that you will have some ideas on how you will want to proceed with available treatments.
 
Treatment
 
In case of advanced liver damage, your cat will need to be hospitalized for intensive therapy. Intravenous fluid therapy is required for patients with deficient body fluids to maintain hydration status. In case of abnormal blood clotting functions, your cat will be given fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma (a normal fluid component of blood). Oxygen will be given to improve the delivery of oxygen to liver tissue. Urine output will be monitored to access the normal functions of the kidneys. In case of low blood sugar, intravenous fluids containing sugar will be administered. Antibiotics can be given to protect your cat against infections, and vitamins are also given for maintaining the liver’s metabolism functions. Intensive care is usually required for at least 3-10 days for initial stabilization.
 
Living and Management
 
Liver damage is a serious health problem, and you will need to provide your cat with a quiet and comfortable environment so that it can properly rest and recover. Patients with liver damage usually have low body temperature, so you will need to keep your cat in a warm environment to prevent further aggravation of normal body temperature.
 
Special dietary support is generally prescribed for these patients, as a supportive and well-balanced nutritional diet is essential for energy levels and a successful recovery. If your cat is unable to eat, your veterinarian will use a stomach tube to feed the cat until it is able to start eating on its own again. Your veterinarian will demonstrate the proper use and cleaning of the feeding tube for home care.
 
Follow-up evaluations of your cat will include laboratory tests to evaluate the current liver functions and efficacy of ongoing treatment. Other than the drugs that have been prescribed by your veterinarian, do not give your cat any medications during the recovery period unless you have been specifically advised to do so by your veterinarian. The already damaged liver will be very vulnerable for some time after treatment, and will need to be treated with great care. Failure of this organ leads to certain death.  
 
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the extent of the initial liver damage. In some patients liver damage is permanent and may lead to complete liver failure."," and Types

 
Symptoms can vary depending on the duration of drug exposure and the type of toxin. The following symptoms may be observed in cats with liver toxicity:

285,Liver Inflammation (Hepatitis) in Cats,"What Is Liver Inflammation (Hepatitis) in Cats?
Liver inflammation in cats can be confusing for pet parents, mostly because there are different terms thrown around when discussing this condition. The reason there are so many terms centers around the fact that more than the liver is involved.

Inflammation of the liver is also known as hepatitis, and it is much more common in dogs than in cats. Cats more commonly get inflammation of the liver, the gallbladder, and the bile ducts at the same time, a condition called cholangiohepatitis. Alternatively, they get inflammation of the bile ducts by themselves, known as cholangitis. Because these diseases of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts are so similar in how they affect cats, they are often grouped together and called cholangitis-cholangiohepatitis syndrome, or CCHS for short. 

The liver has a lot of important jobs in the cat's body, from eliminating toxins to synthesizing proteins. One of the many important roles the liver plays is bile production. Bile is necessary for the digestion of food. It is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is nestled in between the lobes of a cat’s liver. Bile is transported from the gallbladder out the bile ducts into the intestine where it helps to break down fats. When the ducts become inflamed, bile is not able to be properly transported into the intestine. This leads to poor digestion of fats and decreased function of the liver.

When CCHS occurs and the liver, gallbladder, or bile duct become inflamed, chronic vomiting and anorexia often occur. Prolonged anorexia can be dangerous for a cat, and if left untreated, CCHS can lead to another liver disease called hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver syndrome. If your cat is not eating, it’s important to get them to your veterinarian right away for diagnostics and prompt treatment.

Causes of Liver Inflammation in Cats
CCHS is often the result of an underlying issue in cats, such as an infection or an overly sensitive immune system that is more prone to inflammation. Gallbladder stones can cause obstruction of the outflow of bile leading to inflammation. Other inflammatory conditions like pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often present in cats affected by CCHS.

The cause of CCHS can be an underlying bacterial infection, but in general, the exact cause of most cases of CCHS is not fully understood.

Symptoms of Liver Inflammation in Cats
The clinical signs of CCHS vary, depending on the cause.

The most common clinical signs associated with inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct in cats include:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Weight Loss
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Icterus (yellowing of skin, gums, whites of eyes)
	
	
	Anorexia or increased appetite
	
	
	Painful abdomen
	
	
	Fever
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Liver Inflammation in Cats
If your veterinarian sees clinical signs of liver inflammation, they will start with a physical exam and look in your cat's eyes, ears, and mouth. They will feel their stomach to determine if enlargement of the liver or other organs is seen. Labs to screen blood for signs of inflammation and evidence of liver or other organ dysfunction will usually be recommended.

In addition to baseline blood work, they may also want to run specialty blood work. Thyroid testing can rule out hyperthyroidism as a cause for high liver values. CCHS is often accompanied by pancreatitis and IBD, so testing for these conditions may be pursued. Other tests used to screen for concurrent pancreatitis and/or intestinal disease may also be performed.

Your veterinarian will likely also recommend imaging, like x-rays and an abdominal ultrasound, to look for enlargement or changes in the organs. They may recommend aspirating the gallbladder during the ultrasound, where they use a long needle to collect cells and look for abnormalities or signs of infection.

Occasionally, an exploratory surgery may be recommended. This allows the surgeon to collect small biopsies (samples of cells) from the liver. This is also a route to visualize the gallbladder for any abnormalities and collect bile samples to see if there is bacterial contamination.

Treatment of Liver Inflammation in Cats
Treatment of CCHS depends on the underlying cause. Many patients with inflammation of the liver and/or gallbladder and bile duct also have inflammation in their pancreas or bowels. These conditions may need additional treatment.

The majority of cats affected by CCHS are hospitalized and placed on IV fluids. Sometimes, feeding tubes are required until they are eating on their own again. Many patients are started on antibiotics like Clavamox®, Baytril®, or metronidazole. Often, antibiotic treatment is continued for three months or more. Some are treated with steroids, like prednisolone, to reduce inflammation. Other supplements or medications may be added to protect the liver or aid in flow of bile, like Denamarin® or ursodiol.

Medications are typically required long term to manage this condition. While most cases can be treated, many patients require regular monitoring and follow-up visits. Occasionally, surgery is recommended if a bile duct is completely obstructed by stones. If this is the case, your veterinarian will refer you to a specialist.

Recovery and Management of Liver Inflammation in Cats
When CCHS is caught early and treatment is started, the prognosis is good. Some cats can even be cured if they have the form that develops from a sudden onset bacterial infection. The majority of patients are managed well with medications long-term.

If the condition is diagnosed immediately and the affected cat starts medications, they may recover in a matter of days. If they have already developed hepatic lipidosis, it may be weeks to months before they recover. Severity of other concurrent conditions, like pancreatitis and IBD, can also alter the timeline of recovery.

286,"Liver Flukes in Cats: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","What Are Liver Flukes in Cats? 
Liver flukes are trematode parasites that infect many types of animals, including cats.

While several types of liver flukes exist, Platynosomum concinnum is the most common one affecting cats. It’s mostly found in hot, humid climates.

Between 15% and 85% of cats living in geographic areas where liver flukes are most common— such as Florida or Hawaii—will become infected.

Cats get liver flukes after they eat another infected animal, such as a lizard. Liver flukes move to the cat’s liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they cause significant damage and inflammation (swelling).

Cats allowed outdoors  are more commonly diagnosed with liver flukes because they hunt and eat infected animals.

Many cats with liver flukes are asymptomatic, while others show concerning symptoms, such as jaundice, vomiting, and weight loss. If a cat shows any of these signs, they should be brought to a veterinarian right away for the right diagnosis and treatment.

With treatment, a cat’s outlook is generally good, and most cats recover fully from liver fluke infections.

However, if left untreated, liver flukes can make cats very ill and may cause liver failure or death.

Symptoms of Liver Flukes in Cats
Many cats can control liver fluke infections and therefore have no symptoms. However, when larger numbers of liver flukes are present, symptoms are more common.

Because of the longer life cycle of liver flukes, symptoms generally start between two and four months after infection and may include the following:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Jaundice
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Distended (enlarged) abdomen
	
	
	Weight loss
	


Causes of Liver Flukes in Cats
Liver flukes have an indirect life cycle, which means they need intermediate hosts to survive and infect cats.

First, liver fluke eggs (found in animal stool) are eaten by a snail and turn into sporocysts in the snail’s body. These sporocysts are released by the snail and eaten by other host animals, such as lizards and frogs, thereby infecting them.

Cats then become infected with liver flukes when they hunt and eat an infected host, such as a frog. After they are eaten, liver flukes leave the cat’s intestines and travel to the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they grow and reproduce. The eggs they make are later shed in the cat’s stool.

Because of the liver fluke’s complex life cycle, it takes about three months for cats to shed liver fluke eggs. Once the eggs are shed, they can be eaten again by snails, and the life cycle restarts.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Liver Flukes in Cats
Diagnosis can be difficult, so veterinarians use a combination of tests to confirm liver flukes in cats.

First, a veterinarian will start with a physical exam to find any obvious abnormalities, such as a distended belly or jaundice. A veterinarian will also ask specific questions, such as when symptoms started and if your cat spends any time outdoors.

Diagnostic tests are helpful to figure out the underlying cause of the cat’s symptoms and may include the following:


	
	Fecal sedimentation: A small sample of feces is combined with water, which allows liver fluke eggs to settle at the bottom so they can be seen under a microscope. Eggs are shed off and on, so this test has the potential for false negatives.
	
	
	Blood work: A small sample of blood is used to check red and white blood cells, platelets, and internal organ function, including the liver.
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound: Ultrasound is a special test using sound waves is used to look at the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts to find damage caused by liver flukes.
	
	
	Liver biopsy: A sample is taken from the liver to see changes, such as inflammation or fibrosis, related to liver fluke infections. This test requires general anesthesia and surgery to collect a sample; therefore, it may not be recommended in all patients, such as those that are critically ill or with other health issues.
	


Treatment of Liver Flukes in Cats
Treatment for liver flukes in cats includes anti-parasitic medications, such as praziquantel or fenbendazole. Getting rid of all the liver flukes may take several courses of treatment.

Other medications that may be prescribed include the following:


	
	Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, to reduce inflammation
	
	
	Antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, to prevent secondary bacterial infections
	
	
	Anti-nausea medications, such as maropitant, to reduce nausea and vomiting
	
	
	Bile acids, such as ursodiol, to increase bile flow through the bile ducts
	
	
	Antioxidants, such as vitamin E, to protect the liver
	
	
	Supplements, such as SAMe, to promote liver health
	


In severe infections, cats may be very ill and need hospitalization and supportive care.

Treatment that may be given includes intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, medication, and feeding support, such as a feeding tube or special diet.

Cats with several liver flukes may have occluded (blocked) bile ducts and may need surgery to fix the problem.

Recovery and Management of Liver Flukes in Cats
With the right treatment, most cats fully recover after mild infections. However, in chronic or severe cases that have been left untreated, the condition can be fatal.

Even after treatment, it can take two months for cats to stop shedding liver fluke eggs. Because eggs continue to be shed, re-infection is a concern if a cat is exposed to the same environment he was in before getting infected.

Pet parents should keep their cat indoors and give all medications exactly as prescribed during the treatment period. They should also ensure their cat attends any follow-up appointments to confirm the infection has been cleared up.

Liver fluke infections can also increase the risk of liver or pancreatic carcinomas in cats due to damage and inflammation from chronic infections. Your veterinarian may recommend keeping an eye on the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts.

Prevention of Liver Flukes in Cats
Because liver flukes are picked up by cats when they hunt and eat other small animals, keeping your cat indoors will prevent them from becoming infected. Keep your cat on monthly parasite protection with products containing praziquantel, such as NexGard® COMBO.
Liver Flukes in Cats FAQsWhat is the life cycle of a cat fluke?A snail eats liver fluke eggs that are found in animal feces. Those eggs develop into sporocysts in the snail’s body, are released into the environment, and are later eaten by animals.

If a cat eats an infected frog, for example, the liver fluke will move out of the cat’s intestines and into the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they mature and reproduce. After two to three months, liver fluke eggs are shed in a cat’s stool and the cycle repeats.
Can humans get liver flukes from cats?Although certain species of liver flukes can infect humans, cats don’t pass liver flukes directly to their pet parents.

	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Jaundice
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Distended (enlarged) abdomen
	
	
	Weight loss

287,Liver Fistula in Cats,"Arteriovenous Malformation of the Liver in Cats

Intrahepatic arteriovenous (AV) fistula is generally a congenital based condition, which causes abnormal passages to develop between the proper liver (hepatic) arteries and the inner liver (intrahepatic) portal veins. It can also develop through surgical injury, trauma, and abnormal tissue or bone growth (neoplasia). Although this condition is uncommon in cats, it does occur.

This severe illness can be addressed with fair results when a proper diagnosis has been settled on. Most treatment will be on an outpatient basis and will include a planned diet, dietary restrictions, and long term observation.

Symptoms and Types

Cats suffering from AV fistula may show lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, excessive thirst (polydipsia), dementia, and abdominal swelling. There are several other signs of AV fistula, such as:


    Ascites (fluid in the abdomen)
    Congenital heart malformations
    Hemorrhages
    Abnormal portal vein coagulation (thrombosis)
    Protein loss in the kidney (nephropathy)
    Intestinal abnormality (enteropathy) hypertension
    Liver disease, cirrhosis of liver


The central nervous system may also be affected by this condition. Symptoms can include:


    Distemper and other infectious disorders
    Lead poisoning, water on the brain (hydrocephalus)
    Idiopathic epilepsy
    Metabolic disorders
    Brain degeneration associated with liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy)


Causes

There is no particular breed that shows a higher predisposition than another. Hepatic AV is a vascular (vessel) malformation that is genetically determined during the embryonic stage of development - also referred to as embryologic anlage. Most conditions begin to show at an early age. In some cases of AV, surgical injury, trauma, or tumor growth (neoplasia) can lead to the problem.

Diagnosis

The disorder can be tested for by conducting a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, and urinalysis techniques, as well as coagulation tests, abdominal (peritoneal) fluid analysis, and an evaluation of bile acids (digestive secretion from the liver). X-rays, ultrasounds, liver biopsies, and explaratory laparotomies (incision into the abdominal wall) are other exams that may help to diagnose the liver malformation.

  

Treatment

While some cats will require surgical care, most can be treated at home with proper nursing care. Modifications to the diet will often include dietary restrictions on nitrogen and sodium. Hydration and electrolyte disturbances will also be addressed and treated. Drugs that rely on liver biotransformation should be avoided, along with any drugs that will react with GABA-benzodiazepine receptors (the transmitters that inhibit anxiety and over excitement). Veterinarians commonly prescribe histamines for blood pressure reduction, and diuretics (furosemides) to relieve excess fluid.

Living and Management

It will be important for your veterinarian to monitor your cat's biochemistry every few weeks, and then every few months following the initial treatment routines. Prognosis is fair when AV is properly treated, although your cat will require ongoing monitoring and treatment to address any related health issues that may arise.

Prevention

As the health issue is mostly congenital in nature, there are no preventative measures to consider."," and Types

288,Liver Failure (Acute) in Cats,"Acute Hepatic Failure in Cats



Hepatic failure, or acute liver failure, is a condition characterized by the sudden loss of 70 percent or more of the liver's function. This diseased state may be due to sudden, massive, hepatic necrosis (tissue death in the liver).



Symptoms



Primary and secondary hepatobiliary disorders - those dealing with the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts or bile - are generally associated with variable hepatic necrosis. However, acute liver failure from severe hepatic necrosis is an uncommon phenomenon. Acute liver failure can affect the body through a number of system failures:




	Gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhea, blood in the stool (hematochezia)
	Nervous system: hepatic encephalopathy (brain disease related to liver failure)
	Hepatobiliary: the liver plus the gallbladder; jaundice, necrosis (tissue death) of the liver cells and bile duct cells
	Renal: the tubules of the kidney may be injured from toxins/metabolites
	Immune/Lymphatic/Hemic: imbalances in the blood and lymphatic systems, may lead to coagulant (clotting) complications




Causes



Acute liver failure is most often caused by infectious agents or toxins, poor flow of fluids into the liver and surrounding tissues (perfusion), hypoxia (inability to breathe), drugs or chemicals that are destructive to the liver (hepatotoxic), and excess exposure to heat. Necrosis (tissue death) sets in, with loss of liver enzymes and impaired liver function ultimately leading to complete organ failure.



Acute liver failure also occurs due to extensive metabolic disorders in protein synthesis (albumin, transport protein, procoagulant and anticoagulant protein factors), and glucose absorption, as well as abnormalities in the metabolic detoxification process. If this condition is not treated promptly, it can result in death.



Diagnosis



Acute liver failure is diagnosed through a full blood workup (hematology), biochemistry analysis, urine analysis, biopsy (the removal and analysis of affected tissue), and ultrasound or radiology imaging.



Hematology/biochemistry/urine analyses will test for:




	Anemia
	Irregularities in thrombocytes (clot promoting blood platelets)
	Abnormally high liver enzyme activity, or liver enzymes spilling out into the bloodstream, signaling liver damage – tests will look for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes in the bloodstream, as well as an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and declining levels of aminotransferases (enzymes that cause the chemical change of nitrogen carrying amino)
	Impairment of protein synthesis
	Low blood sugar – particularly dangerous for cats
	Normal to low blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration (i.e., nitrogen level in the urine)
	The presence of bilirubin – the red-yellow bile pigment that is a degraded product of the deep red, nonprotein pigment in hemoglobin (the oxygen carrying pigment in red blood cells) – in the urine
	The presence of ammonium urate crystals in the urine
	The presence of sugar and granular casts (solid deposits) in the urine, indicating internal tubular injury from drug toxicity




Lab Tests will be used to look for:




	High values of total serum bile acid (TSBA) concentrations, which will indicate liver insufficiency. However, if non-hemolytic (not destructive to blood cells) jaundice has already been confirmed, TSBA findings will lose their significance in relation to acute liver failure
	High plasma ammonia concentration; this, in conjunction with high TSBA concentrations, would be strongly indicative of hepatic insufficiency
	Abnormalities in blood platelets and coagulation (blood clotting) factors
	Tissue necrosis and cell pathology; biopsy (tissue sample) results will confirm or negate zonal involvements, and identify any existent underlying conditions




Imaging tests will look for:




	X-rays and ultrasound tests may indicate an enlarged liver, and other hepatic abnormalities, including conditions that may not be directly related to the liver.










Treatment



Hospitalization is vital for treating acute liver failure. Fluids and electrolytes, along with colloid (the gelatinous substance necessary for proper thyroid functioning) replacements and oxygen supplementation, are key aspects of treatment and care. Your cat will be placed on restricted activity in order to give the liver an opportunity to regenerate. Catheter feeding is recommended for highly unstable patients, while enteric feeding (feeding directly into the intestines) in small amounts is recommended for otherwise stable patients. A normal protein diet with supplemental vitamins E and K is advised.



The common medications used for liver failure are antiemetics, drugs for hepatic encephalopathy (brain disease, with or without edema), hepatoprotectants (to decrease the activity of aminotransferases), coagulopathy drugs, and antioxidants.","

289,Liver Disease in Cats,"What Is Liver Disease in Cats?
The liver is an extremely important organ, situated behind the diaphragm and near the stomach, pancreas, and spleen. It has multiple roles, including:


	
	Protein synthesis
	
	
	Production of clotting factors and bile, which aids in digestion of foods
	
	
	Detoxification of wastes and toxins, as well as the metabolism of drugs
	
	
	Storage of vitamins and minerals
	
	
	Immunologic functions
	


Because of its diverse role, the liver is susceptible to damage from a variety of sources, and, if affected, significant problems can occur. Inflammation results, known as hepatitis, which progresses to death of liver cells, loss of function, and eventual liver failure.

Fortunately, the prognosis can be good if caught early enough and treated appropriately.

Symptoms of Liver Disease in Cats
Usually, unless in the end stages or caused by a more severe form of liver disease, most symptoms cats experience include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Inappetence
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Unusual bruising and/or bleeding
	
	
	Increase in thirst and urination
	


Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), or symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and behavior changes like circling and head pressing, seizures, and coma are also noted with liver disease.

Causes of Liver Disease in Cats
Liver disease in cats has numerous causes, which often makes determining the source frustrating for veterinarians. The vet will need to consider your cat’s age, lifestyle, and environment to help narrow the cause of liver disease. For instance, obese cats are more prone to hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease); couple that with a period of stress (e.g., boarding) and you have the perfect environment for this disease to occur. Hepatic lipidosis occurs when excessive fat is broken down rapidly, which overwhelms the liver’s ability to process it. It then becomes stored in the liver, affecting liver function. When left unchecked, it can lead to jaundice and death.

Other causes of liver disease include:


	
	Bacterial infections
	
	
	Viral infections
	
	
	Fungal infections
	
	
	Parasitic infections
	
	
	Inflammatory conditions (cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis)
	
	
	Toxins (e.g., Tylenol, blue-green algae, sago palms)
	
	
	Portosystemic shunts (PSS)—usually a congenital issue that often impairs the liver’s ability to detoxify wastes
	


The liver can also become secondarily affected by endocrine disorders such as Diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism and conditions affecting the gallbladder such as bile duct obstruction and cholecystitis (inflammation) or even rupture.

Cancers can also occur in the liver, as can hepatic amyloidosis—seen primarily in Persians and Abyssinians—which is an inherited condition that causes abnormal protein deposits in the liver.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Liver Disease in Cats
In addition to a physical exam and screening tests such as bloodwork and urinalysis, other blood tests may be recommended depending on the cat.

To provide an accurate diagnosis, a liver sample may be needed. This is often accomplished through surgery or a biopsy, where a needle is inserted directly into the liver.

Treatment of Liver Disease in Cats
Liver disease in cats can be curable, depending on the underlying cause. Medications and diet are often the main treatments recommended. Because the liver is responsible for many functions related to digestion and metabolism of nutrients, a diet that requires less work from the liver can be helpful. Prescription diets such as Hill’s l/d or Purina® Pro Plan® HP Hepatic are formulated to have more digestible protein, contain more antioxidants, and have lower amounts of certain minerals like copper, which can be harmful to the liver. Your veterinarian will be able to determine the appropriate diet for your cat.

Medications such as SAMe, acetylcysteine, vitamin supplements, and ursodiol are often used to treat liver disease.

Supportive care such as IV fluids, pain control, antacids, and anti-nausea medications—and even a feeding tube—might be recommended to slow disease progression and allow the liver to regenerate. In extreme cases, plasma transfusions may be necessary, and chemotherapy and/or surgery might be pursued where applicable.

Recovery and Management of Liver Disease in Cats
The liver has a unique ability to regenerate. And for some diseases, if caught early and treated aggressively, cats can have a good prognosis and go on to live a normal life. Unfortunately, for some cats where the disease is excessive or prognosis poor, humane euthanasia may be recommended.

290,Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) in Cats,"Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Cats

 

Hepatocellular carcinoma describes a rare but malignant tumor of the epithelial tissues of the liver (the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of body structures – in this case the liver). This type of tumor is rare in cats – cats are more commonly affected by bile duct carcinoma. There are no breed predispositions, but affected cats are on average older than ten years of age.

 

Symptoms

 

The following symptoms are typically  absent until the disease reaches an advanced stage:




	Lethargy
	Weakness
	Loss of appetite (anorexia)
	Weight loss
	Polydipsia (excessive thirst)
	Diarrhea
	Vomiting
	Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver with uneven size); precedes development of overt clinical signs
	Abdominal hemorrhage


 

Causes

 


	Unknown
	May be associated with chronic inflammation or hepatotoxicity (chemical-driven liver damage)
	Toxins


 

Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A microscopic study of fluid taken from the liver by needle will be done to detect dysplasia (a pre-cancerous change in cells and tissues) and overt malignant features of cancerous cell spread. Occasionally, the only finding of the study is necrotic (dead) cells in the liver. A hepatic biopsy will need to be conducted in order to make a conclusive diagnosis. This will require that your veterinarian surgically remove a sample of liver tissue for laboratory analysis. A needle biopsy is not recommended.

 

Diagnostic imaging may include abdominal radiography to localize the tumor, and X-ray imaging of the chest to check for metastasis into the lungs.

 







Treatment

 

Treatment will be given on an outpatient basis, unless surgical intervention requires postoperative critical care during recuperation, or bleeding tumors require transfusion of blood components or whole blood transfusions. Your veterinarian may consult a veterinary oncologist for assistance.

 

Surgical removal of the tumor is recommended when possible, and is often most successful when the tumor is massive and singularly located. Up to 75 percent of the liver can be surgically removed without pronounced loss of function. However, nodular and scattered (diffuse) forms are often not good candidates for surgery. Chemotherapy is not recommended, as it has not been found to be successful in the treatment of liver cancer.

 

Living and Management

 

Your veterinarian will schedule follow up exams for abdominal palpation and to evaluate for recurrence every two to four months.  Abdominal ultrasonographies will be repeated every two to four months for the first year, and liver enzymes will be checked. Unfortunately, this is often a malignant cancer, and the prognosis is poor. Even without metastasis, survival after surgery is generally less than three months. However, the final prognosis will depend on the degree of tumor invasion, how much of the tumor could be successfully removed, and whether it has spread into the body.

291,Liver and Spleen Cancer (Hemangiosarcoma) in Cats,"Spleen and Liver Hemangiosarcoma in Cats

 

Hemangiosarcomas are fed by the blood vessels and fill with blood. Because of this, the tumor can rupture, leading to sudden and severe hemorrhage, collapse, and rapid death. Often, owners do not realize their cat is affected until the sudden hemorrhage or collapse.



Hemangiosarcomas of the spleen and liver are highly metastatic and malignant vascular neoplasms (blood vessel tumors) that arise from the endothelial cells, which line the interior surface of blood vessels. It begins as a large mass that develops in the liver or spleen, spreading rapidly through the blood cell routes, most frequently to the liver from the spleen, or to the lungs from the spleen and liver. In some cases, it can also metastasize to the brain or heart. It can also lead to growth of implantation lesions in the omentum, an apron type fold in the abdominal wall.



This type of cancer is relatively rare in cats, as opposed to dogs. Often, just as with dogs, the cancer goes undetected and the cause of death is not known until a necropsy is performed. In cats, hemangiosarcomas were found in 18 cats out of 3,145 necropsies, with the liver the most common site to be affected. The average age of occurrence is ten years, and in cats, the domestic shorthair appears to be more disposed to hemangiosarcomas.  

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Symptoms are generally related to the organs involved; that is, a tumor of the spleen will result in impaired spleen function, and a tumor of the liver will result in impaired liver function. Other common symptoms include:




	Weight loss
	Weakness
	Lameness
	Intermittent collapse
	Muscle incoordination (ataxia)
	Partial loss of movement (paresis)
	Seizures
	Dementia
	Pale mucous membranes
	Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
	Abdominal (peritoneal) fluid
	Palpable abdominal mass
	Acute blood loss (often fatal)


 

Causes

 

Cause is unknown.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, and as much detail as you can about the symptoms you have observed. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Findings can include anemia or a low blood platelet count. 

 

Diagnostic imaging is one of the best methods for viewing the abdominal cavity and making an initial diagnosis. X-rays may reveal one or more abdominal masses, along with possible evidence of abdominal fluid. Thoracic radiography of the chest cavity can detect metastasis into the lungs. Ultrasonography can be used to reveals masses in the spleen and any liver involvement. Echocardiography may be performed in patients with evidence of fluid around the heart and may detect cardiac masses. Your doctor may also be able to use ultrasound to guide a fine needle to the tumor in order to take a tissue and fluid biopsy. An analysis of tissue taken directly from the tumor is the most conclusive method for making a diagnosis.

 





Treatment

 

This type of tumor necessitates inpatient care. Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and transfusions of fresh whole blood for patients with severe anemia will be part of the initial medical care. Coagulation will also be managed as necessary. Depending on the stage of metastasis, surgical management may also be employed. If possible, the tumor will be removed along with the surrounding tissue or the entire organ, A successful splenectomy may give your cat an additional three months of life. If chemotherapy can be successfully employed along with surgery, survival time may be lengthened but not considerably. Because of the aggressive and malignant nature of this tumor, survival time is generally short.

 

Living and Management

 

Your cat's activity will need to be restricted until after initial surgical management period is over. Your veterinarian will advise you on the level of activity you should encourage in your cat. It is important to take care in physical activity and to follow your doctor's instructions, since spontaneous hemorrhage may occur.

 

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.

 

Chest and abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasound are needed every three months after the initial treatment to monitor for recurrence.

292,Lice in Cats,"Feline Pediculosis



Lice are parasites that live on the skin. Left unchecked, they can grow to be an infestation on the cat’s body. Lice are actually very small insects that feed by chewing on the skin of the animal they are infesting, in this case, the cat. They are not as common as fleas; they are most often seen in situations where sanitary practices are poor.



Symptoms and Types of Cat Lice



Symptoms seen in infested cats include:




	Excessive itchiness, scratching
	A dry scruffy-looking coat
	Hair loss, most often around the ears, neck, shoulders, groin, and rectal area




Causes of Cat Lice



There is only one species of lice that infests cats: Felicola subrostrata.



Lice can be passed directly from one cat to another through direct contact or through contact with contaminated objects, such as grooming utensils or bedding.



Lice are species-specific. They do not move from one species to another. That means that you cannot get lice from your cat nor can your cat get human specific lice from you.



Diagnosis of Cat Lice



Diagnosis is easily made by visually observing lice or their nits (eggs) in the hair. Adult lice are flat, six-legged insects with no wings. Nits can be seen attached to the individual hair shafts and appear as small white dots.



Treatment for Cat Lice



There are a wide variety of shampoos, as well as insecticidal sprays and powders that are effective in killing lice. In addition, products such as fipronil and selamectin can also be used. (They come in various brand names.) It may be necessary to treat your cat more than once to kill the developing nits as they hatch. Follow your veterinarian’s directions closely, as these products can be harsh on some cats.



In cases where your cat’s fur is badly matted, it may be necessary to shave the fur to be sure of getting to the deeper lice and their nits.



To prevent reinfection, dispose of or wash all of your cat’s bedding, as well as thoroughly cleaning all of the places your cat spends time. Some items that cannot be laundered or washed down may be sealed tightly in plastic bags for a few weeks. Disinfect all grooming utensils and anything else your cat comes into contact with regularly, such as litter boxes and crates, and of course, all of the furniture, rugs, carpeting and hard flooring."," and Types of Cat Lice

293,Leukemia (Chronic) in Cats,"Chronic Lymphocytic Cancer in Cats
 
Animals with abnormal and malignant lymphocytes in the blood are said to have a rare form of cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An integral component to the immune system, lymphocytes can affect many body systems when damaged.
 
Although rare, this form of leukemia affects both dogs and cats.
 
Symptoms
 
The symptoms for chronic lymphocytic leukemia are usually non-specific and may include:
 

    Increased thirst (polydipsia) and consumption of water
    Increased urination (polyuria)
    Enlargement of lymph nodes
    Fever
    Lameness
    Bruises

 
Causes
 
The following are suspected but unproven risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia:
 

    Exposure to ionizing radiation
    Cancer-causing viruses
    Chemical agents

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing may reveal anemia, abnormally low number of platelets (cells involved in blood clotting), and abnormal increase in number of lymphocytes in blood film observed under microscope. Your pet’s veterinarian will also conduct a bone marrow biopsy, which will provide a more detailed picture into the abnormalities in lymphocyte production.

 


Treatment
 
If the cat is displaying no symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend against treatment. Otherwise, chemotherapy remains the most popular form of treatment. A veterinary oncologist will be able to devise a treatment plan based on the cat and stage of the disease. In some patients, the spleen may need to be removed to avoid complications.
 
Living and Management
 
Regular monitoring and checkups are necessary to evaluate the cat's response to treatment and the progression of the disease. Moreover, regular blood, cardiac, and body system testing will be required if the cat is undergoing chemotherapy. This is because cats are more prone to infection when taking chemotherapeutic drugs. In case of serious complications, your veterinarian may reduce dosages or stop the treatment altogether.
 
Should you be required to administer the drugs, your veterinarian will instruct you as to the dosage and frequency. Do not ever increase or reduce the dosage of drugs without prior consulting with your veterinarian. These chemotherapeutic agents are just as toxic to humans, and should only be administered under strict guidelines.","

294,Leukemia (Acute) in Cats,"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Cats

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a disease in which cancerous lymphoblasts (cells that are in the beginning stage of development) and prolymphocytes (cells in the intermediate stage of development) reproduce, and then circulate through the bloodstream, entering into the body's organs. These cells will also infiltrate both the inside of the bone marrow and the outside (extramedullary) of the bone marrow, displacing hematopoietic stem cells. 

Hematopoietic cells are the normal, healthy precursors of red blood cells, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells. Cats with this disease will acquire impaired immunity, and will be inclined to contracting infections.

Symptoms and Types


    Generalized illness, no specific 	symptoms
    Tiny, non-raised purple spots on 	the skin, from hemorrhages beneath the skin (petechia), or dark 	red-purple spots on the gums, from ruptured blood vessels under the 	skin (ecchymotic)
    Inconstant symptoms, dependent 	upon which organs have been infiltrated by neoplastic (abnormal) 	cells


Causes


    Known cause in cats:
    
        Feline leukemia virus infection (FeLV)
    
    


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background medical history, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If cancer is suspected, your doctor will also need to take bone marrow biopsies (samples) for a microscopic (cytologic) examination of the cells. If malignant cancer cells are present, the examination will show lymphoblastic infiltration of the bone marrow. Abdominal x-rays may also be taken to check for an enlarged liver and/or an enlarged spleen.



Treatment

Animals can normally be treated on an outpatient basis. However, if your cat has low levels of red blood cells, platelets (the cells responsible for clotting), or other blood clotting factors, your cat should be hospitalized and given blood transfusions to prevent excessive bleeding. If your cat has been diagnosed with leukemia, your veterinarian will also prescribe a chemotherapeutic medicine to halt the growth of malignant cells. You will need to wear gloves when you give this medication to your cat.

Living and Management

If your cat is diagnosed with leukemia, you will need to keep it isolated from other animals. Your cat’s system will lack an immune response (immunocompromised) as a result of both the cancer and the therapy. In the process of destroying fast growing cancerous cells, chemotherapy will also destroy white blood cells responsible for fighting invasion, making your cat prone to infection. Even a simple cold can quickly become a fatal case of pneumonia. Red blood cells can also be affected; one possible side affect of a low red blood cell count is anemia. And blood platelets, the cells responsible for coagulation (clotting), can be affected as well. A low platelet count can result in bruising and excessive bleeding. Animals suffering from this disorder are prone to hemorrhage from lack of platelets. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your cat’s peripheral blood count and bone marrow status. Unfortunately, the prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is grave."," and Types

"
295,L-Carnitine Deficiency in Cats,"L-carnitine is an important nutrient that acts as a transport for fatty acids, essential for the cellular production of energy. Deficiency of this nutrient can cause a variety of health problems for a cat; most significantly, the association with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a disease of the heart. The heart and skeletal muscles do not synthesize the carnitine nutrient on their own, requiring it to be transported there for use. Therefore, a deficiency of carnitine in the body will have a negative effect on the heart and skeletal muscles. While carnitine supplements are not always successful at reversing the effects of this deficiency, they have proven to be the most successful course of treatment.


Symptoms and Types 

Signs of this deficiency may include:


    Lethargy
    Muscle 	pain
    Exercise 	intolerance
    Enlarged 	heart (dilated cardiomyopathy)
    Heart 	muscle failure


L-carnitine is important for muscle tissue to receive energy and function normally. A deficiency in this nutrient, therefore, can create a negative impact throughout the cat's body.

Causes 

This disease is still being studied, but there is some evidence that suggests that certain breeds may be at increased risk of acquiring this disorder.

Diagnosis

In order to diagnose this deficiency, heart (endomyocardial) muscle biopsies must be performed in order to measure carnitine levels.


Treatment
 
Your cat's size and weight will determine the proper dosage of L-carnitine supplements. Keep in mind that many cats will not show an improvement in health. In addition, some cats may even show an increase in diarrhea as the carnitine dosage in their diet is increased. An appropriately prescribed diet, with plenty of fluids, will be essential for preventing complications during this period.

Living and Management 

Once carnitine treatment has begun, it is recommended that you continue regular veterinary check-ups with your cat. Your doctor will perform an echocardiogram (or EKG) every three to six months to ensure that treatment has been effective.

Prevention 

There are no known methods of prevention, other than maintaining a healthy diet for your cat."," and Types

296,Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats,"What is Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats?
Laryngeal paralysis is an upper-airway disorder where the cartilages of the larynx do not open and close normally. The larynx, or voice box, is the opening to the trachea (windpipe) that allows your cat to meow, but also acts as a gatekeeper between the mouth and the lungs. When the cat inhales, muscles pull the larynx open from two sides and then they relax when the cat exhales.

In cats with laryngeal paralysis, these muscles do not function properly, so when the cat inhales, the airway does not pull open, creating an airway obstruction.

Laryngeal paralysis in cats is a medical emergency because if left untreated, airway obstruction can quickly progress to suffocation and death. If suspect laryngeal paralysis in your cat, contact your nearest animal hospital immediately.

Check your pet’s symptomEarly symptoms can be subtle and difficult to identify, but may include:


	Noisy breathing
	Raspy meow/voice change
	Coughing
	Lethargy
	Increased respiratory rate and/or increased respiratory effort
	Trouble swallowing
	Weight loss


As the disease progresses, a cat will have a hard time breathing (panting, expanding chest and weakness) especially during physical activity. This eventually can lead to collapse, suffocation and death. The progression can take months, or even years.

Secondary symptoms may include:


	Aspiration pneumonia
	Overheating
	Overheating
	Anxiety/Stress


Causes of Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats
The following are possible causes of laryngeal paralysis in cats.


	Abscesses or tumors of the neck or chest
	Trauma (injury to the nerves of the larynx)
	Nervous system disorders (issues with the nerves that supply the muscles of the larynx)
	Abnormalities of the muscles (myopathy)
	Hypothyroidism (low thyroid levels), which is rare in cats
	Congenital birth defect
	Idiopathic (unknown)


While obesity in cats will not directly cause laryngeal paralysis, it is known to make the disorder much worse.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats
If your cat has any evidence of respiratory distress or trouble breathing, immediately seek veterinary attention. The vet will perform a thorough physical examination, including listening to your cat’s heart and lungs. A tentative diagnosis of laryngeal paralysis may be made based on physical examination and the presence of inspiratory stridor (a high-pitched vibrating noise when your cat is breathing in and out).

Definitive diagnosis will require a procedure called laryngoscopy, which involves sedating the cat and visualizing the larynx with either a laryngoscope or an endoscope to confirm whether the larynx is opening properly during inspiration.

Neck and chest X-rays will likely be performed to look for signs of a mass or tumor, as well as to rule out aspiration pneumonia. A full bloodwork panel will be performed to determine complete blood count and serum chemistry, as well as the cat’s thyroid level.

Treatment of Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats
Supportive Care or Steroids

Initially, in mild cases, supportive care such as steroids or sedatives/tranquilizers may be used to help keep the inflammation and swelling down and help the cat to relax and improve overall breathing. However, as the disease progresses, these treatment options will be insufficient and the cat may experience respiratory distress.

Any cat with respiratory distress, or trouble breathing, should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian. Often, these cats will require sedation, oxygen supplementation and intubation in the short term to allow them to breathe and stabilize. Additional supportive care may include cooling - if the cat has overheated - or IV fluids if the cat has become dehydrated.

Surgery

Once your cat is stable, surgery is often necessary to open the larynx and restore normal breathing. The surgical procedure is called a unilateral arytenoid lateralization or tieback and involves using a suture to permanently open (or tie back) one side of the larynx so that air can more freely flow into the lungs. This removes the airway obstruction and allows your cat to breathe much easier.

Recovery and Management of Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats
Most cats will need to remain hospitalized for one to two days after surgery and remain on IV fluids and pain medication. Cats are typically discharged once they resume eating and if no vomiting or respiratory distress occurs. The recovery time at home includes 10 to 14 days of rest and restricted activity, but after that, your cat can typically be released to normal activity.

The biggest risk in the post-operative period is aspiration. Since the airway has been “tied” open, the pet is at risk to breathe in food or vomit, resulting in aspiration pneumonia. Signs of aspiration pneumonia include the following:


	Lethargy
	Weakness
	Fever
	Cough
	Decreased appetite
	Possible increased respiratory rate and effort (visibly takes more energy for cat to breathe or panting)


Unlike with laryngeal paralysis, you most likely will not hear noisy breathing.

Aspiration pneumonia can become deadly and requires antibiotics and sometimes hospitalization for IV fluids and oxygen support, so it is important to monitor your cat carefully after surgery.
Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats FAQsCan a cat live without surgery for laryngeal paralysis?  Initially, laryngeal paralysis can often be successfully medically managed with steroids and sedatives/tranquilizers. However, over time, the disease will typically progress to respiratory distress. At this point, surgery is often needed for survival.
Can laryngeal paralysis be cured in cats? Laryngeal paralysis is treatable but often requires surgery. With surgery, most cats can go on to live normal lives.
What is a typical symptom of laryngeal paralysis?The most common symptoms of laryngeal paralysis in cats are noisy breathing, raspy meow/voice change, and cough.

297,Laryngeal Disease in Cats,"Disease of the Voice Box or Larynx in Cats

The voice box, or larynx, serves as a passage for airflow from the external environment to the lungs. It protects the lungs from aspiration during swallowing and regurgitation, and allows for vocalization (such as meowing). Laryngeal disease refers to any condition that alters normal structure and/or function of the voice box or larynx.

In cats, the incidence of laryngeal disease is based on limited reports in the literature, but it appears to be significantly lower than in dogs. Affected cats are usually older, but it is seen occasionally in younger cats secondary to trauma or surgical procedures; the average age in one report was 11 years of age. Cancer of the larynx or voice box generally occurs in middle-aged to older cats. There is no defined breed susceptibility.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms are directly related to the degree of impairment or restriction of airflow through the voice box or larynx, though acquired paralysis is often associated with exertion, stress, or extreme heat. Some common signs of laryngeal disease include:


	Panting
	Noisy respiration and a high-pitched sound when breathing in (most common)
	Change in character of the meow
	Occasional coughing
	Reduced activity, exercise intolerance
	Elevated rectal temperature (especially during warm weather months)


Causes

Laryngeal disease may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired, most often due an unknown cause. The following are some of the more common causes of laryngeal diseases:


	Paralysis
	Vagal nerve abnormality - the vagus nerve supplies nerve fibers to the voice box (larynx), throat (pharynx), windpipe (trachea) and other organs
	Abnormality involving the recurrent laryngeal nerves (branches of the vagus nerve)
	Diseases in the chest - such as infections, inflammation, cancer
	Nervous-system disorders involving multiple nerves
	Abnormalities of muscles (myopathy)
	Immune-mediated disorders
	Possible hormonal deficiencies - such as inadequate production of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), or inadequate production of steroids by the adrenal gland (hypoadrenocorticism)
	Trauma
	
		Penetrating wounds (such as bite wounds) or blunt trauma to the neck
		Injury secondary to ingested foreign materials – such as bones, sticks, needles, pins
	
	
	Cancer
	
		Primary cancer of the voice box (larynx) or spread of cancer into the tissues of the voice box (metastatic cancer)
		Lymphoma (predominant cancer in cats)
		Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma (a cancer that originates in glandular tissue)
		Thyroid cancer - may put pressure on or actually invade the recurrent laryngeal nerves
	
	


Risk factors include existing lung abnormalities, such as pneumonia and chronic airway disease. Fluid build-up in the space between the chest wall and the lungs (pleural effusion) can also have a significant impact on breathing and may increase the breathing difficulties associated with diseases of the voice box or larynx.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. One of the possible underlying causes your doctor will be looking for is thyroid disease, particularly if your cat is older.

Some of the diagnostic imaging techniques that may be used to find the underlying disorder are X-ray, fluoroscopy, and bronchoscopy to help rule out other differential diagnoses and to detect aspiration pneumonia. These are all fairly non-invasive techniques, as they do not require surgery to inspect the internal structure of the airways. Ultrasound is also a useful diagnostic tool in the non-invasive diagnosis of laryngeal masses.

To get an even closer look at the larynx, your doctor may conduct a laryngoscopy. Your cat will need to be placed under heavy sedation or anesthesia in order for your veterinarian to evaluate laryngeal abduction on inspiration and to detect whether mass lesions are present.

Laryngeal collapse is a complication of long-standing brachycephalic airway syndrome. Chronic proliferative, pyogranulomatous (granular and pussy) laryngitis will require culture and microscopic examination to define; broad spectrum antibiotics, given beforehand, along with tapered administration of corticosteroids, may be required to obtain an optimal response. Conditions that cause obstruction, such as tracheal collapse or masses close to the larynx, may mimic laryngeal disease. If a mass lesion is found during examination, it may require surgical removal.

Diagnosis of paralysis can be confirmed by a loss of abduction (a change in the position) of the laryngeal cartilages during deep inspiration. Paralysis on only one side may be noted in earlier or milder forms of laryngeal dysfunction.

 

Treatment

Your cat will be treated as an outpatient while awaiting surgery, as long as its health remains stable. If it is an emergency situation characterized by marked breathing distress, oxygen therapy, combined with sedation and steroids, will be administered.

If your cat is in distress, the staff at the animal clinic can employ active body-cooling measures with intravenous fluids and ice, and your veterinarian can create a temporary surgical opening into the windpipe (or trachea – a procedure known as a temporary tracheostomy) to make oxygen intake easier. This care may prove life-saving if your cat is not responding appropriately to the emergency medical approach.

If you are providing your cat with temporary care at home while awaiting surgery, you will need to avoid warm, poorly ventilated environments, as these can further compromise the body's normal cooling mechanisms and proper air exchange. Avoid the use of collars during this time as well, in order to minimize pressure on the voice box or windpipe. You will also want to restrict activity pending surgery, or if you have opted out of surgery.

In the case of paralysis, surgical management is the treatment of choice. A variety of procedures have been reported, but correction on one-side only is preferred. The benefit of this procedure will depend on the surgeon's experience and expertise. In case of trauma to the trachea, a temporary surgical opening into the windpipe (temporary tracheostomy) may be life-saving and curative. A permanent surgical opening into the windpipe (permanent tracheostomy) may improve quality of life.

If cancer has been diagnosed, surgical removal of the tumor may be curative. For squamous-cell adenocarcinoma, surgical removal, coupled with radiation therapy, is the management of choice.

Prescribed medications will depend on the final diagnosis and long-term course of treatment that is prescribed by your doctor.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat frequently for aspiration pneumonia, as this is one of the major life-threatening risks of Laryngeal disease. There is an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia after any surgical procedure involving the voice box or larynx, as surgery places the larynx in a “fixed-open position,” eliminating its protective function during swallowing or regurgitation. There is an increased risk of aspiration, overall, particularly if evidence of aspiration was noted before surgical treatment of paralysis, and when swallowing disorders were found to be present as well.

Generally, improvements in activity and exercise tolerance are reported by owners after effective surgery. The long-term prognosis is good to excellent with successful surgery for paralysis. If the initial surgery was unsatisfactory, additional surgery may improve the prognosis. For the treatment of trauma, progress is usually satisfactory with conservative management, even after an emergency tracheostomy.

The prognosis is more often than not poor in the treatment of cancers such as squamous-cell adenocarcinoma, even with radiation therapy. For cancers such as lymphomas, the prognosis depends on the chemotherapy that is used and patient response."," and Types

298,Lactic Acid Build-Up in Cats,"Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis refers to the abnormal build-up of  lactic acid in the body. When this abnormal build-up occurs, it affects  the heart (cardiac system), and eventually all of the organ systems in  the body.
 
Lactic acid is a substance that is produced by the  muscles during normal physical activity, and which is elevated during  exercise. In a normal functioning body, the liver and the kidneys work  to maintain the balance between lactic acid production and its removal.  When lactic acid is not being adequately removed, the body becomes ill.  The recommended treatment for lactic acidosis will be dependent upon the  underlying medical condition that is causing the lactic acid to build  up.

Symptoms and Types

Common symptoms can include heavy breathing, vomiting, and abdominal  pain. Persistent lactic acid build-up in the body will affect heart  function and output, and can have a severe impact on organ function.  Most signs of lactic acidosis are related to the underlying cause of the  medical condition and not the actual condition.

Causes

One of the primary causes of lactic acidosis is an insufficient amount  of oxygen in the blood or poor use of oxygen by the body. Young cats are  at a higher risk for developing the condition and they are also more  likely to go into traumatic shock as a result of acquiring it. Older  animals are more likely to develop kidney (renal) failure, heart  failure, liver disease, cancer, anemia, or vascular disorders.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian's primary objective is to determine what the cause is  for the lactic acid build-up in the body. A series of blood tests will  be carried out in order to pinpoint the cause of the condition, as well  as to determine what the appropriate treatment will be.



Treatment

Lactic acidosis is often severe by the time it is diagnosed and will  require aggressive therapy to bring it under control. Prescribed  treatment by your veterinarian will be dependent upon the underlying  cause. The ability of your cat's body's to clear lactate (salt of lactic  acid) will be a good indicator of the therapy's success, and can  determine whether your cat will survive.

Living and Management

It is important to observe your cat's ongoing response to the given  treatment so that the chances for a healthy recovery are increased. Some  of the potential complications of lactic acidosis include multiple  organ failure and a heightened mortality rate."," and Types

Common symptoms can include heavy breathing, vomiting, and abdominal  pain. Persistent lactic acid build-up in the body will affect heart  function and output, and can have a severe impact on organ function.

299,Lack of Intestinal Motility in Cats,"Ileus in Cats
 
The term ileus (functional or paralytic) is used to denote temporary and reversible blockages in the intestines due to the absence of bowel motility. This absence of normal intestinal movements (or peristalsis) results in accumulation of intestinal contents in certain areas of intestine. It should be remembered that ileus itself is not a primary disease in cats, but a complication seen due to some other disease or condition affecting normal motility of the intestines.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Vomiting
    Depression
    Mild abdominal distention or discomfort due to gas accumulation due to obstruction


Causes
 

    After gastrointestinal surgery
    Electrolyte imbalances
    Infections and inflammatory diseases of gastrointestinal tract
    Persisting mechanical obstruction (e.g., foreign body in GI tract)
    Blockages of blood supply to intestine or part of intestine
    Septicemia (body wide illness due to presence of bacteria in blood) due to gram negative bacteria
    Shock
    Abdominal injury
    Distention of intestines due to aerophagia or excessive burping or belching
    After use of certain drugs
    Toxicity (e.g., lead)


Diagnosis
 
After recording a detailed history and performing a complete physical examination, routine laboratory tests will be conducted. These tests include complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The main objective of the diagnostic effort is to find the underlying cause of this problem. Results of routine laboratory testing may reveal some information related to the underlying disease. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound will help in finding various abnormalities including: presence of gas, fluid, mechanical obstruction (e.g., foreign body), tumor in abdomen, and other such conditions.
 
For confirmation, your veterinarian may use more specific testing like Barium-Impregnated Polyethylene Spheres (BIPS). Barium is a chemical used in certain radiological studies to enhance visualization of anatomical structures. BIPS are markers given orally and will demonstrate the extent of intestinal obstruction and motility disorder. Your veterinarian will assess the time it takes for these markers to move along the intestines and how much delay is involved. This test also helps in the localization of the anatomical site involved.

Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis, especially for an assessment of mechanical obstruction. Your veterinarian will look directly into the stomach and intestine using an instrument called an endoscope. A rigid or flexible tube will be inserted into your cat’s stomach, where your veterinarian will be able to visually inspect and take pictures. In some cases, exploratory surgery may need to be performed to rule out mechanical obstruction. X-ray, computed tomography scan, magnetic imaging test, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid circulate around brain and spinal cord) may be required in patients in whom spinal cord injury is suspected.





Treatment
 
As ileus is the result of some other underlying disease, treating the underlying cause is of utmost importance for resolution of this problem. For example, your veterinarian will use fluid therapy to address fluid and electrolyte derangements, which is common in cats with ileus. In some cats, drugs to enhance intestinal motility are also given to stimulate intestinal movements. During treatment, your veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the abdomen in order to find the status gut sounds and motility.
 
Living and Management
 
If the primary underlying cause is identified and corrected, the prognosis is excellent in affected animals. But determining the exact underlying cause may be difficult in some animals. Follow directions given by your veterinarian regarding care and nutrition of your cat, and call your veterinarian immediately if you see any untoward symptom in your cat.
 
In patients with a history of infections, regular temperature monitoring may be required at home. If medicines are prescribed for your cat, strictly follow the exact frequency and dosage of each drug. In addition, do not stop or alter treatment prior to consulting with your veterinarian."," and Types

300,Kitten Constipation,"What Is Kitten Constipation?
Kittens start to go to the bathroom on their own at 3-4 weeks old. Younger kittens require stimulation by their mama cat or pet parent to urinate and defecate. Don’t be concerned if your young kitten doesn’t poop with every stimulation, but as they get older, they should have a schedule of when they need to be stimulated or when they use the litter box.

If your kitten is litter-trained, you may not notice that they are constipated until you realize you haven't seen any feces for a few days. Kittens that cannot defecate are uncomfortable and also at risk for serious problems if left untreated.

For kittens of any age, if they go more than 24 hours without defecating, they might be constipated. Constipation is defined as difficulty defecating, and obstipation is defined as a lack of any feces being produced. Both of these conditions can occur in kittens, and both are very serious.

You can try a few things at home to help, but if a kitten does not regain a normal pooping schedule within 48 hours, they should be taken to a veterinarian as soon as possible, as constipation can be life-threatening for a kitten.

If constipation is left untreated, the colon will enlarge to accommodate the stool that hasn’t been passed and cause a condition called megacolon.

If megacolon is left untreated and stool continues to accumulate the colon can burst, spilling feces into the abdomen, which is often fatal.

Symptoms of Kitten Constipation
Signs your kitten may be constipated include:


	
	No feces produced in 24-48 hours
	
	
	Straining to defecate but nothing comes out (tenesmus)
	
	
	Producing small, hard fecal balls

	
		
		With or without liquid feces—not to be confused with diarrhea
		
		
		Blood and/or mucus in the stool
		
	
	
	
	Crying in the litter box or when trying to defecate
	
	
	Decreased or total loss of appetite
	
	
	Distended abdomen, bloated appearance
	
	
	Restlessness
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy, weakness
	


Causes of Kitten Constipation
The many causes of constipation in kittens include:


	
	Very young kittens, less than a few weeks old, are unable to defecate on their own. If the mama cat or pet parent does not stimulate the kitten or if the kitten is orphaned without anyone taking care of them, they will be unable to defecate. The feces will build up in the colon and eventually become a life-threatening condition.
	
	
	Dehydration is a common cause of constipation in kittens. When your kitten does not have access to a bowl of fresh water, if they eat only dry food, or during the weaning process when they are transitioned off their mother’s milk, dehydration can occur. Dehydration often causes kittens to still be able to pass small amounts of very hard stool.
	
	
	When young kittens transition from nursing to eating kitten food, they may not have enough fiber in the diet if they are not on a high-quality, completely balanced diet. Lack of fiber can cause constipation in young kittens.
	
	
	Kittens are very curious creatures and they have the tendency to eat things they should not, causing a gastrointestinal obstruction or blockage. An obstruction in the stomach or intestines often means they cannot defecate. Ribbons, string, toys, and hairballs are all common causes of obstructions that can cause obstipation (unable to defecate) in kittens.
	
	
	Kittens that have many intestinal worms can become constipated from the worms blocking the colon. This impaction of worms also causes an intestinal blockage that stops stool from passing.
	
	
	Kittens’ lack of activity or gaining too much weight can contribute to obstipation. Regular exercise and proper diet are important to avoid constipation.
	
	
	Neurologic conditions are more common in older cats, but some young kittens can have disease conditions that interfere with or damage the nerve control of their hind end. Nerves coming from the spinal cord control all functions of the body, including the ability to have a bowel movement. If the nerves that control the colon and the anus are damaged or nonfunctional, a kitten can get constipated from not physically being able to push the stool out of the rectum.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Kitten Constipation
If your kitten has not produced stool in 24-48 hours, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination, including palpating, or feeling, the abdomen. Often, since kittens and their intestinal tract are so small, the vet can feel the stool packed within the body just by placing light pressure on the belly.

If your vet suspects your kitten is constipated, an x-ray of the abdomen is needed to be able to view the problem and figure out its severity. X-rays will show the large amount of stool in the colon and can also be used to find if megacolon is occurring. An ultrasound of the abdomen can also be done to view the thickness of the colon wall and figure out if it is full or empty.

Whenever your kitten is having any issues related to bowel movements, it is always helpful to provide your vet with a stool sample. With significant constipation or true obstipation, with no stool being produced, your vet will understand that the stool sample was not possible.

Treatment of Kitten Constipation
Once your veterinarian has diagnosed your kitten’s medical problem, they will provide a complete treatment plan based on the severity of the constipation. Treatment varies from outpatient medications and dietary changes to hospitalization to even surgical intervention in some cases.

Making sure your cat is on a well-balanced, age appropriate, AAFCO-approved diet is important. Diets that are rich in both insoluble and soluble fiber are best for a kitten with constipation problems. Giving your kitten a fiber supplement can help to draw water back into the colon, hydrating the stool for ease of a bowel movement. Probiotics are also helpful to promote gut health. Both subcutaneous (under the skin) and intravenous (IV) fluids can help your kitten stay hydrated.

Kittens that have an obstruction from intestinal parasites/worms will need to be dewormed with medication for the type of parasite found in the fecal exam. Depending on your kitten’s age and degree of constipation, they might recommend a laxative to help produce bowel movements. An oral medication, Lactulose, is a sugar-based laxative given to soften stool and to treat constipation.

In cases where medications and fluids are not helpful or the degree of constipation is severe, your vet might need to give your kitten an enema. Enemas should never be tried at home and must be done by a veterinarian to avoid complications such as colon rupture.

In the most severe cases of constipation and all cases of obstipation, your cat might need to have a procedure called a deobstipation. Deobstipation is when your kitten is sedated and the veterinarian can manually remove the stool from your cat’s colon. An enema is often given at the same time as deobstipation. Although it is more common in older cats, if your kitten has developed megacolon, they will likely need both surgical intervention and lifelong medications.

Kitten Constipation Home Remedy

While there are few things you can try at home to help your constipated kitten, it is always best to have them examined by your veterinarian if you think they are having any medical issues such as constipation. If your cat is obstipated and no stool is coming out, then they do need to see a veterinarian as soon as possible—that is a medical emergency. 

If you have a very young kitten, under 4 weeks old, stimulating them often with a soft cotton material around their anus will help to produce a bowel movement. Be sure your kitten is well-hydrated by giving them free access to fresh water, feeding them canned kitten food, and adding water to the food. This can all be helpful to avoid constipation.

Keeping your kitten active and moving to stimulate bowel movements can also be helpful. Bicycle the legs, gently massage the belly, and encourage walking to get things moving to try and help produce a bowel movement. A soak in a warm water bath can also be helpful to relax their muscles while you massage their belly. Be careful not to massage or put too much pressure on your kitten’s belly as the intestines are delicate. You want to avoid any internal injury.

Recovery and Management of Kitten Constipation
Once the hard stool or obstruction is removed, recovery from kitten constipation is quick. The most important step is to figure out the underlying cause so that it doesn’t happen again. Follow the instructions your veterinarian provided, and finishing medications as prescribed is another key to recovery. Most often, the diet changes and medications will be given longterm to prevent your kitten from getting constipated again.

Even if your kitten is feeling better and back to their normal self, it’s important to never stop treatment without the approval of your kitten’s veterinarian. Kittens must also have routine deworming and fecal checks to keep them parasite-free. Some types of worms are even treated and prevented with monthly flea and tick prevention products such as Revolution®.

Certain medications administered for the purpose of diagnosing or treating medical disorders may cause kidney damage. When this occurs, it is referred to as drug-induced nephrotoxicity. It is more commonly recognized in dogs than cats. And although drug-induced nephrotoxicity may occur in cats of any age, older cats are more susceptible.

Symptoms and Types

Signs associated with nephrotoxicity may include:


    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Depression
    Dehydration
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Ulcers in the mouth
    Bad breath (halitosis)
    Bladder control problems (polyuria and polydipsia)


Causes

Nephrotoxicosis can be induced by the administration of pharmacologic agents (or drugs), which interfere with the blood flow to the kidneys as well as cause tubular dysfunction in the kidneys. If left untreated, the damage to the renal tubule cells may lead to tubular necrosis and even kidney failure. Risk factors that may increase the odds of developing drug-induced nephrotoxicity include dehydration, advanced age, and fever.

Diagnosis

When drug-induced nephrotoxicity is suspected, a veterinarian will often biopsy a portion of kidney tissue. This will help him or her identify kidney failure and also the proper course of treatment. Another useful diagnostic procedure is a urine analysis.



Treatment

Most cats with drug-induced nephrotoxicity will require inpatient care, especially those that are also suffering from kidney failure. In these severe cases, surgery may be required.

Living and Management

Once the cat has returned to your home, it is important that his activity be reduced and that you provide him with a modified diet that is not excessive in protein and phosphorous. Dehydration is a common threat for cats with kidney problems; you will need to monitor him for any untoward symptoms and advise your veterinarian if they should occur, who may assist by administering fluid therapy.

Electrolyte panels may be performed as frequently as every one or two days in order to evaluate the severity of azotemia, a condition commonly associated with drug-induced nephrotoxicity, in which abnormal levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as a number of body-waste compounds) are found in the blood. This is of utmost importance, as cats with severely progressed azotemia may develop acute kidney failure within days.

Moreover, drug-induced nephrotoxicity may even lead to chronic kidney disease months or years later. Therefore, if any signs of illness -- such as vomiting or diarrhea -- recur, contact your veterinarian immediately.

Prevention

The best way to prevent this type of toxicity is to not use nephrotoxic drugs. However, if your cat requires this type of medication, administer it only under the advisement of your veterinarian. You should also consult him or her before adjusting the dosage and the possibility of adverse drug interactions."," and Types

302,Kidney Stones in Cats,"Nephrolithiasis in Cats



Cats that develop clusters of crystals or stones -- known as nephroliths or, more commonly, “kidney stones” -- in the kidneys or urinary tract are said to be suffering from a condition called nephrolithiasis. The kidney is composed of thousands of nephrons, each consisting of blood capillaries and a series of tubes through which filtered fluid flows as urine is produced. The tubes of the nephron drain into ducts through which urine flows; these ducts eventually enter the renal pelvis and a tube through which urine follows into the ureter. Kidney stones or kidney stone fragments can also pass through this system of tubes and into the ureter, causing serious complications.



Both dogs and cats are susceptible to kidney stones. However, some breeds of cat are more susceptible to certain types of kidney stones than others, including the domestic shorthair and longhair, Persians, and Siamese.



Symptoms and Types



Many cats with kidney stones have no apparent signs; that is, the nephroliths are often not detected until diagnostic testing is done for other medical problems. Some symptoms that may occur include blood in urine (hematuria), vomiting, recurrent urinary tract infections, painful difficult urination (dysuria), and frequent urination with small volume of production (polyuria). Other symptoms may appear but vary depending on the location and type of the stones.



Note that some nephroliths may be “inactive”; meaning, they are not infected, not progressively enlarging, and not causing obstruction or clinical signs. Inactive kidney stones may not require removal, but should be monitored periodically (via urine analysis for example) for any changes.



Causes



There are a number of causes and risk factors that may contribute to the development of nephrolithiasis and the development of uroliths, such as the oversaturation of stone-forming material's in the cat's urine. Other potential causes include increased levels of calcium in the urine and blood, diets that produce high (alkaline) urine pH, and recurrent urinary tract infections.



Diagnosis



You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of the cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, ultrasound imaging, and urinalysis. However, in order to confirm the diagnosis, identify the mineral content of the stones, and develop a proper course of treatment, pieces of nephroliths must be retrieved for analysis. This is usually achieved by performing a procedure known as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), in which stones are broken up within the urinary tract using sound waves.







Treatment



Many cats diagnosed with inactive kidney stones can be treated at home with proper medication administered in order to dissolve the stones. An adjustment to the cat's diet is also necessary. These dietary changes will be dependent on the chemical makeup of the kidney stone.



In severe cases, the cat may require immediate removal of the kidney stone(s) and hospitalization. There are a number of options for kidney stone removal, including surgery or ESWL.



Living and Management



Because kidney stones tend to recur, routine monitoring is essential. Most veterinarians recommend abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound examinations every three to six months post initial treatment. A periodic urine analysis is also frequently recommended.



Prevention



If your cat is predisposed to nephrolithiasis, special foods and dietary management can be effective at preventing stone formation."," and Types

303,Kidney Inflammation Due to Fluid Accumulation in Cats,"Perirenal Pseudocysts in Cats
 
A perirenal pseudocyst is a condition in which fluid accumulates in a capsule surrounding the kidney, causing the kidney to enlarge. However, it is not technically a cyst because it lacks a true membrane covering. Perirenal pseudocysts primarily affects mature male cats (more than 8 years); if found in young cats, it commonly affects only one kidney.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Although most cats with a perirenal pseudocyst have a nonpainful, enlarged abdomen, some may not display any symptoms (asymptomatic). In severe cases, symptoms of renal failure may manifest.
 
Cause
 
Although the exact cause of a perirenal pseudocyst is not completely understood, kidney tumors, surgeries involving the kidney, and certain types of injuries are thought to be factors for developing the capsule.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are normal unless severe renal insufficiency is present.
 
Imaging studies, including X-rays and ultrasounds, may identify which kidney is affected. Additionally, a fluid sample from around the affected kidney may be taken for further evaluation.



 


Treatment
 
Perirenal pseudocysts are usually not life-threatening and some cats need no treatment whatsoever. Otherwise, the fluid is surgically drained from the capsule, especially when the cat's abdomen is distended. There are also forms of treatment when severe renal diseases are involved.
 
Living and Management
 
Regular follow-up examinations (every two to six months) are required to evaulate the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. Watch your cat for untoward symptoms, such as increased thirst (polydipsia), blood in urine (hematuria), and weight loss, and inform your veterinarian of them immediately, as they may be signs of renal failure."," and Types

304,Kidney Infections in Cats,"What Are Kidney Infections in Cats?
The kidneys are two organs in a cat’s abdomen. They filter toxins from the body and excrete these toxins via urination. They also work to direct electrolyte and protein shifts in the body, which are important for normal body functions.

Kidney infection (also termed pyelonephritis) affects the renal pelvis, a funnel-like portion inside the kidney that filters urine from the kidney to the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). Infections that develop in the kidneys are termed upper urinary tract infections. Infections that occur in the bladder and urethra are called lower urinary tract infections.

Kidney infections are uncommon in cats, but lower urinary tract infections are very common. Some cats are more prone to kidney infections than others, including cats with diabetes mellitus; cats with chronic kidney disease; cats prone to lower urinary tract infections; cats with urinary tract stones; and those born with immune issues (feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus) or congenital issues with their kidneys, such as amyloidosis or polycystic kidney disease.

If left untreated, pyelonephritis can lead to kidney dysfunction, kidney failure, or sepsis, a bacterial infection that spreads to the bloodstream. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are critical.

Symptoms of Kidney Infections in Cats
Symptoms of pyelonephritis can range from mild to severe. Often, no clinical signs are noted early in the condition. As it progresses, symptoms might include:


	
	Increased thirst or urination
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	Frequent urination with small amounts of urine produced
	
	
	Blood noted at the end of urination
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Pain when touching kidneys or abdomen
	
	
	Vocalizing during urination
	
	
	Urine with an unpleasant odor
	
	
	Back pain
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Causes of Kidney Infections in Cats
Pyelonephritis in cats is most commonly caused by E. coli or Staphylococcus bacterial infections. These infections usually start in the urethra or bladder, then move to the ureters.

Some risk factors can make cats more prone to kidney infections. These include malformations such as ectopic ureters and renal dysplasia; and medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, stones in the urinary tract, chronic steroid administration, urine retention for long periods, and urinary catheterization—which can introduce bacteria from the outside environment.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Kidney Infections in Cats
Your veterinarian will likely already have or take a history of your cat and do a thorough physical examination as the first steps in diagnosing a possible kidney infection. They will likely recommend full bloodwork to assess kidney enzymes, protein levels, electrolytes, and red and white blood cell counts. Bloodwork helps investigate for systemic diseases that can predispose cats to pyelonephritis, as listed above.

Your veterinarian will also recommend a urinalysis to look for signs of infection in the urine, such as blood, protein, white blood cells, or bacteria. A urine culture is often also considered. This can allow the isolation of specific bacteria, which then helps determine the best antibiotics to fight off the infection.

Abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasound are often used to help differentiate between lower and upper urinary tract infections. These will also allow investigation for urinary tract stones or congenital abnormalities that predispose cats to pyelonephritis.

Treatment for Kidney Infections in Cats
Pyelonephritis treatment depends on the underlying cause. Cats are often treated as outpatients unless they are not eating well, are dehydrated, are clearly in pain, or have signs of sepsis or kidney failure. These more severe cases often require hospitalization with intravenous fluid therapy and intravenous antibiotics. Less severe cases (in cats that are well hydrated and are eating well) can be treated with oral antibiotics and sometimes pain medications.

If other systemic diseases are causing the pyelonephritis, they will require appropriate therapy for resolution of the infection. Surgery is sometimes necessary if urinary tract stones are found—especially if they are noted within the bladder. These can be a source of infection and put cats at a high risk of urinary blockage (a medical emergency)

Recovery and Management of Kidney Infections in Cats
Antibiotics are chosen based on urine culture results, which again help isolate the exact bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotic therapy for two to six weeks is usually necessary in cases of kidney infection. Often, your veterinarian will recheck a urine sample during or after completing antibiotics to ensure that the infection has been cleared entirely.

Unfortunately, at-home therapy is not effective in treating pyelonephritis in cats, which is why a veterinary visit is so important. Cats with upper or lower urinary-tract disease are at a high risk of chronic, recurrent infections. Cats with chronic urinary tract issues, especially infections, can be more difficult to treat because their bodies can become resistant to continued antibiotic therapy.

Environmental changes shown to lessen the recurrence of lower urinary-tract signs include:


	
	Decreasing stress in the household
	
	
	Increasing water intake (switching to canned food or adding water bowls/fountains to the home)
	
	
	Adding more litter boxes to the household
	
	
	Keeping litter boxes clean
	


Potential complications of pyelonephritis are include sepsis, kidney failure, and in severe cases, death. Contact your veterinarian if your cat is showing abnormal signs or unusual behavior.

305,Kidney Filtration Problems in Cats,"Nephrotic Syndrome in Cats

One of the body’s main methods for disposing of waste products is through the establishment and formation of urine. This process occurs in the kidney, where penetrable clusters of capillaries called glomeruli function to filter waste from the blood, thus establishing the formation of urine. When filtration cells (podocytes) in the kidney’s glomeruli become damaged, due either to immune complexes in the blood (called glomerulonephritis), or to dense deposits of hard protein (amyloid) - the abnormal accumulation of which is called amyloidosis - degeneration of the kidney’s tubular system occurs. This degeneration of the tubular system is medically referred to as nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome lose too many necessary proteins into the urine; a condition medically termed as proteinuria. Two of these proteins are albumin, which helps to maintain blood pressure and keep blood in the vessels, and antithrombin III, which prevents blood clots from forming.

When greater than 3.5g of proteins are lost each day, blood pressure falls, and less blood stays in the blood vessels. Consequently, the kidneys act to conserve sodium in the body, which results in swelling of the limbs, hypertension and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity.

When crucial thyroid proteins, which control the body’s metabolic rate, are also lost into the urine, signs of hypothyroidism can also be seen. There is a decreased break-down of cholesterol, and the affected cat will often show signs of muscle wasting. In addition, the liver also increases its production of proteins and lipids, further raising the levels of cholesterol-rich lipids circulating in the blood. This can lead to arteriosclerosis, diminished blood circulation due to thickening, and hardening of the arterial walls. Also, since proteins essential for breaking down blood clots are lost into the urine, the blood coagulates much more easily and blood clots can become lodged in blood vessels, causing paralysis or strokes.

If left untreated, progressive glomerular disease can lead to urea nitrogen and creatinine (a metabolic waste product) accumulation in the bloodstream. That is, the accumulation of metabolic waste products in the bloodstream, which could lead to long-term kidney failure. This disease is relatively rare in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Swelling 	of the limbs
    Fluid 	accumulation in the abdomen, abdominal enlargement
    Retinal: 	detachment or hemorrhage due to high blood pressure
    Swelling 	of the optic nerve (at the back of the eye) due to high blood 	pressure
    Heart 	rhythm disturbances due to enlargement of the left ventricle of the 	heart
    Difficulty 	breathing
    Bluish-purple 	skin color


Causes

Long-term inflammatory conditions which could predispose cats to developing glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis:


    Infection
    Cancer
    Immune-mediated 	disease


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, along with a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count (CBC), an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily.

Protein electrophoresis may help to identify which proteins are being lost into the urine through the kidneys so that a prognosis can be established. X-ray and ultrasound imaging will show if there has been a loss of detail in the abdominal cavity due to fluid seeping into the abdominal cavity (effusion). If glomerular disease is the cause of the nephrotic syndrome, mild enlargement of the kidneys may also be observed.



Treatment

The majority of patients can be treated on an outpatient basis, but if your cat is showing signs of severe nitrogenous waste in the bloodstream (azotemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), or blocked vessels due to clotting (thromboembolic disease), it should be hospitalized. Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to stop the loss of protein into your cat's urine and increase blood pressure.

Living and Management

You will need to limit your cat's activity in order to prevent thromboembolic disease. A low-protein, low-sodium diet, perhaps one that is specially formulated for strengthening the kidney, should be fed to your cat. Your veterinarian will assist you in creating the best diet plan for your cat.

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat at one month after the initial treatment, and then again at three month intervals for the year following. At each visit, a chemical blood profile, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel will be performed. The chemical blood profile is useful for monitoring kidney function, and the urinalysis will indicate the amount of protein being lost into the urine. Your doctor will also take your cat's blood pressure and monitor its weight at each visit.

Glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis are progressive. If the underlying cause cannot be resolved, your cat will eventually lose all kidney function. The prognosis for end-stage kidney disease is poor."," and Types

306,Kidney Failure In Cats,"What is Kidney Failure in Cats?
Kidneys serve many vital roles in the body, include filtering and removing waste in the form of urine. They maintain proper hydration by balancing water and electrolytes, create the hormones responsible for red blood cell production, and help regulate blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys help modify vitamin D so it can be used by the body.

As in people, cats have two kidneys, one on each side of the abdomen. Unfortunately, as in people, kidney failure can occur when these organs become too damaged to work properly. Kidney failure usually develops because of chronic kidney disease.

Kidney failure is a life-threatening situation, and there are few treatment options when a cat reaches this stage. Pet parents are advised to discuss their cat’s prognosis with their veterinarian, monitor their cat’s quality of life, and discuss euthanasia.

Types of Kidney Failure in Cats

Kidney failure can be described as acute or chronic:

Acute Kidney Failure: (also called acute renal failure) occurs when the kidneys are suddenly damaged, usually within hours or days. This may be due to poison or from a fast-acting infection. Cats with ARF may regain some kidney function with treatment, supportive care, and time, depending on the cause.

Even with treatment, ARF is terminal in about 50% of cases. However, cats that do survive the initial cause usually have a better outcome compared to cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Chronic Kidney Disease: CKD eventually leads to end-stage renal failure, or ESRF, which is considered stage 4 of kidney disease.

In CKD, a gradual loss of kidney tissue occurs over a period of months or years due to underlying genetic factors, chronic infections, age, cancer, or other underlying medical conditions. Clinical signs of chronic kidney disease show up when about two-thirds of normal kidney tissue has been lost. As it worsens, medical management becomes ineffective in helping the kidneys perform their crucial roles.

Symptoms of Kidney Failure in Cats
Clinical signs of kidney failure differ slightly, depending on if the condition is acute or final stages of CKD.

In cats with acute renal failure, clinical signs include:


	
	Sudden onset of decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy or listlessness 
	
	
	Vomit, sometimes tinged with blood
	
	
	Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea
	
	
	Ammonia-like odor to the breath (due to uremic toxins building up in the blood)
	
	
	Changes in urination (large amounts or cessation)
	
	
	Abdominal pain due to swollen kidneys (seen in cases of acute renal failure)
	
	
	Seizures
	


In cats with end stage renal failure associated with chronic kidney disease, clinical signs include:


	
	Anorexia/refusal to eat 
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy/excessive sleepiness 
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Confusion (possibly pacing and restlessness)
	
	
	Changes in behavior (withdrawn, irritability)
	
	
	Uncontrolled urination or defecation
	
	
	Ammonia-like odor to the breath
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Decreasing body temperature
	
	
	Greasy, unkempt, thin hair coat
	


Causes of Kidney Failure in Cats
Acute kidney failure has numerous causes, but it can be categorized as due to toxins or from an underlying medical issue.

Toxin exposure may be caused by ingesting:


	
	Ethylene Glycol (antifreeze)
	
	
	Lilies 
	
	
	NSAIDs for people, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen
	
	
	Heavy metals  like arsenic, lead, or mercury
	
	
	Rat poisons
	


Underlying medical issues


	
	Urethral obstructions (inability to urinate)
	
	
	Low blood pressure
	
	
	Clotting disorders
	
	
	Heart disease
	
	
	Pyelonephritis (infection in the kidneys)
	
	
	Parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis or kidney worms)
	
	
	Tick-borne diseases
	
	
	Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)
	
	
	Trauma or severe allergic reactions that result in shock
	


Chronic kidney disease eventually progresses to end-stage kidney disease and kidney failure. How quickly this happens is hard to predict. It is very common in geriatric cats, and some breeds have a higher incidence, such as Abyssinians, Burmese, Maine Coons, Persians, Ragdolls, Russian Blues, and Siamese.

Other risk factors include:


	
	Tumors and cancer (such as lymphoma)
	
	
	Viruses specific to cats, such as feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus
	
	
	Chronic pyelonephritis (a slow-developing infection in the kidneys)
	
	
	Underlying genetic disorders like polycystic kidney disease or amyloidosis
	
	
	Immune-mediated disorders
	
	
	Previous acute renal failure/acute kidney injuries that did not fully respond to treatment
	
	
	Underlying medical conditions, like hyperthyroidism
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Kidney Failure in Cats
In cases of acute renal failure, bloodwork, urine samples, and imaging (x-rays and ultrasound) will likely be performed to diagnose the condition and help determine the best course of treatment. Your veterinarian will look for signs of:


	
	Anemia
	
	
	Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
	
	
	Abnormal hydration levels, by measuring electrolyte concentration (sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus)
	


In cases of end-stage renal failure, many of the same signs listed above will be monitored to help determine the stage of renal failure.

What are the final stages of kidney failure in cats?

When a cat’s kidneys cannot perform their job, anemia, dehydration, and the build-up of uremic toxins will occur. Ulcers can develop on the tongue, gums, and along the digestive tract. The cat may act dull and “out of it,” with possible seizures. They may go into respiratory distress. Medical management may not be able to stop the downward spiral.

Treatment of Kidney Failure in Cats
Options for treating end-stage kidney failure in cats are limited. They include strategies to manage kidney disease such as special diet, supplements, and anti-nausea medication. In many cases, hospitalization with IV fluids and the placement of a feeding tube can stabilize the cat. Some respond well and may be able to return home for continued management of their underlying kidney disease.

For more intensive treatment, hemodialysis to filter the blood of cats is available. This will not cure kidney failure but may improve quality of life.  However, few veterinary clinics possess the necessary equipment and the cost is very high. This treatment requires working with a board-certified veterinary internal medicine specialist and consultation with a member of the American Society of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology.

Kidney transplant is another experimental route, but this has not widely been used and would require working with specialists to determine if your cat is a good candidate.

When a cat has kidney failure, it is important to work closely with your veterinarian to discuss prognosis, strategies to monitor quality of life, and when euthanasia should be considered.

Recovery and Management of Kidney Failure in Cats
The prognosis for cats with renal failure is grave.  At some point, medical management will not keep a cat comfortable and end-of-life planning will need to be discussed. This is one of the hardest (if not the hardest) decision a pet parent will make. Your veterinarian can help you understand questions about your cat’s quality of life and develop a plan should euthanasia need to be considered outside of normal business hours.
Kidney Failure in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with kidney failure?In about half of the cases of acute renal failure, cats may have a few days to live. If their lab work and clinical signs are not showing signs of improvement, their veterinarian will likely recommend euthanasia. In cats with chronic kidney disease that has progressed to end-stage renal failure, the median survival time for cats in stage 4 is 35 days. 
Are cats in pain when they have kidney failure?In ARF, the kidneys may be swollen and painful (sort of like a lower backache).  In cases of end-stage renal failure, there is typically no pain associated with the kidneys. The big concern in cats with kidney failure is quality of life, because rather than feeling pain, they may feel sick and have nausea and weakness due to the buildup of uremic toxins.

307,Kidney Failure and Excess Urea in the Urine in Cats,"Renal Failure and Acute Uremia in Cats



The sudden onset of abnormally high levels of urea, protein products, and amino acids in the cat's blood is referred to as acute uremia. This condition usually follows kidney injuries or occurs when the urinary tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) are obstructed. As a result, the outflow of urine is obstructed, creating an imbalance in fluid regulation and leading to a buildup of potential toxins in the body. Fortunately, acute uremia can be successfully treated and cured if it is identified on time and treated promptly.



Most cat breeds, whether male or female, are affected by acute uremia; however, exposure to chemicals such as antifreeze increases the risk of uremia. Therefore, the incidence of acute uremia is higher in the winter and fall than in other seasons.



The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how acute uremia affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



As this potentially toxic blood flows through the cat's body, most systems are affected, including the urinary, digestive, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and immune systems.



Upon examination, cats will appear to be in normal physical condition, but may appear to be in a depressed state. When symptoms are apparent, signs can include loss of appetite, listlessness, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be tinted with blood. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the tongue, ammonia-smelling breath (due to the urea), ulcers in the mouth, fever, abnormally fast or slow pulse, decreased or increased urine output, and even seizures. The kidneys may feel enlarged, tender, and firm on palpation.



Causes



Kidney failure or obstruction to urine output may be due to any of the following:




	Kidney inflammation
	Kidney or ureteral stones
	Presence of foreign bodies in the ureter(s)
	Damaged kidney tissue that causes back-flow of urine
	Low blood flow to the kidneys as a result of trauma, excess bleeding, heat stroke, heart failure, etc.
	Ingestion of chemicals (e.g., some pain killers, dyes used for internal imaging, mercury, lead, antifreeze)




Diagnosis



A complete blood profile will be conducted by your veterinarian, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Cats with acute uremia may have high packed cell volume and an increased white blood cell count. The levels of certain protein enzymes and chemicals such as creatinine, phosphate, glucose, and potassium will also be high.





Urine may be collected by inserting a catheter or a fine needle aspiration into the cat; the results of which may show high levels of protein, glucose, and the presence of blood cells. In order to view and examine the urinary system clearly, contrast dyes may be injected into the bladder so that the interior of the bladder, the ureters, and the kidney are illuminated on the X-ray and ultrasonography imaging.





Treatment



If the uremia is due to toxic poisoning, the first step will be to eliminate the toxins from the body. This may be done through gastric lavage, where the stomach is cleansed, or by administering activated charcoal to neutralize the toxin. Specific antidotes may also be administered if the toxic agent can be identified.



Care is also aimed at re-establishing fluid balance, blood circulation, and in establishing the balance of chemicals in the blood. Strictly monitoring fluid intake, food consumption, and nutrition is very important while treatment is underway.



Some medications that may be prescribed are:




	Diuretics
	Antiemetics
	Dopamine derivatives
	Mucosal protectants to counteract acidity
	Bicarbonates to re-establish chemical balance in the body




Based on your cat's response to these drugs, your veterinarian might also recommend dialysis or surgery.



Living and Management



Generally, this condition has a poor prognosis for recovery. Some potential complications include seizures, coma, high blood pressure, pneumonia, bleeding in the digestive tract, cardiac arrest, fluid overload, widespread infection in the blood, and multiple organ failure.



The cost involved of treating an animal with acute uremia may also very high. Sometimes, dialysis can be used until the cat is stable enough to tolerate surgery.



After the procedures are complete, it is important to monitor daily fluid levels, mineral levels, body weight, urine output, and general physical status. The entire process of recovery depends on various factors, such as the extent of organ or system damage, the origin of the disease, and the existence of other pathological conditions or diseased organs.

As this potentially toxic blood flows through the cat's body, most systems are affected, including the urinary, digestive, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and immune systems.



Upon examination, cats will appear to be in normal physical condition, but may appear to be in a depressed state. When symptoms are apparent, signs can include loss of appetite, listlessness, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be tinted with blood. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the tongue, ammonia-smelling breath (due to the urea), ulcers in the mouth, fever, abnormally fast or slow pulse, decreased or increased urine output, and even seizures. The kidneys may feel enlarged, tender, and firm on palpation.

308,Kidney Enlargement in Cats,"Renomegaly in Cats



Renomegaly is a condition in which one or both kidneys are abnormally large, confirmed by abdominal palpation, ultrasounds, or X-rays. The cat's respiratory, nervous, hormonal, urinary and digestive systems are all affected by this condition.



In addition, renomegaly is not exclusive to cats, dogs can suffer from it, too. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



There are occasions when the cat is asymptomatic, or does not display any signs whatsoever. However, some of the more common symptoms seen in cats with renomegaly include:




	Lethargy
	Anorexia
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Weight loss
	Oral ulcers
	Dehydration
	Discolored urine
	Pale mucous membrane
	Foul-smelling breath (halitosis)
	Abdominal pain
	Abdominal mass
	Abnormally large abdomen
	One or both kidneys palpably large
	Excess urine and excess thirst (polyuria and polydipsia)




Causes



The kidneys may become abnormally large as a result of inflammation, infection, or cancer. Renomegaly can also occur due to urinary tract obstruction, degeneration of the urinary tubes (ureters), formation of cysts in the urinary tract, various infections, abscesses, inflammatory conditions, genetically transmitted diseases, clots in the kidneys, and toxins in the system.



Exposure to infections such as leptospirosis or leukemia may also lead to renomegaly.



Diagnosis



A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis; cats will also have blood drawn for feline leukemia testing. A palpation exam and X-rays will also be performed to assist your veterinarian in visualizing the extent of abnormality in the kidney size, and thus diagnose your cat's condition.







For cats with cancer, thoracic X-rays will help your doctor to determine if the cancer has spread. Ultrasonography, which uses sound waves, will also help distinguish the structural details of internal organs so that your doctor can determine the amount of renal swelling, or detect irregularities in other organs.



Aspiration of renal fluid and a biopsy is another procedure which may be performed on your cat.





Treatment



Your cat will be treated on an outpatient basis unless it is suffering from dehydration or renal failure. Treatment will begin with diagnosing and treating the underlying cause, maintaining fluid balance with intravenous fluids, if necessary, and replenishing minerals and electrolytes. If your cat is otherwise healthy, a normal diet and normal exercise will be advised.



Drugs prescribed by your veterinarian will vary according to the underlying cause of the renomegaly. However, drugs that may have a toxic effect on the kidneys should be avoided.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will want to see your cat during regular follow-up examinations, where he or she will assess the cat's physical recovery and hydration status.



If your cat's symptoms return, you will need to contact the veterinarian immediately. Possible complications of renomegaly include kidney failure and hormone imbalances that mimic hormone-producing cancers."," and Types

309,Kidney Disease in Cats,"What Is Kidney Disease in Cats?
A cat has two kidneys, one on each side of the abdomen, and they play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. Additionally, the kidneys serve to regulate the body’s balance of fluids, minerals, and electrolytes. They conserve water and protein and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin.

There are different types of kidney disease in cats and various underlying causes. These often develop into one of two categories: acute or chronic.

Examples of acute kidney disease:


	Viral infections (feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus)
	
	Parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis, kidney worm Capillaria plica)
	
	
	Bacterial infections, often caused by an ascending bladder infection, which can lead to pyelonephritis (kidney infection)
	
	
	Tick-borne diseases
	
	
	Toxins, such as antifreeze, ingestion of lilies, and certain antibiotics
	
	
	Shock and hypotension (low blood pressure)
	
	
	Obstructive uropathy, often seen in male cats that are unable to urinate. This is considered a medical emergency
	


Examples of chronic kidney disease:


	
	Immune-mediated diseases
	
	
	Stroke-like events or hypertension (high blood pressure)
	
	
	Clotting disorders
	
	
	Cancer, lymphoma is most common in cats.
	
	
	Amyloidosis, seen primarily in Persians and Abyssians, is an inherited condition that causes abnormal protein deposits that lead to kidney damage.
	
	
	Polycystic kidney disease is another inherited condition seen in Persians. It consists of cysts developing within a kidney and leads to progressive kidney failure.
	
	
	Congenital kidney dysplasia is a condition that leads to small, nonfunctional, or underdeveloped kidneys.
	
	
	Consequence of acute kidney injury
	


Cats cannot survive without their kidneys. Many of these conditions are progressive in nature and debilitating which can lead to death. When enough damage has occurred (losing about two-thirds of kidney function), signs become apparent and regeneration will not occur, leading to chronic kidney disease. Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are medical terms used interchangeably to describe the same condition.

Symptoms of Kidney Disease in Cats
Clinical signs are often related to the severity of the kidney disease and underlying cause. Most cats will exhibit symptoms including:  


	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Intermittent vomiting
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Sores in the mouth
	
	
	Foul breath
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Fever and decreased activity
	
	
	Urinary accidents, incontinence, or inability to urinate
	
	
	Lower back pain
	
	
	Edema (fluid-filled swelling in the limbs)
	


Some cats may show muscle-wasting and signs attributed to high blood pressure, such as vision loss and weakness.

Causes of Kidney Disease in Cats
Kidney disease can be caused by a variety of factors:


	
	For some cats, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury, from a severe infection (including feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, and pyelonephritis), ingestion of a toxic substance (like antifreeze or lilies), and from certain medications.
	
	
	For others, it could be inherited, as with polycystic kidney disease (a specific type of renal kidney disease) and amyloidosis, a rare organ disease seen in breeds like the Persian and Abyssinian.
	
	
	It could also be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, clotting disorders, and even cancers like lymphoma.
	


Even with the best testing, in some cases, the underlying cause remains unknown.  Progression of chronic kidney disease will continue with no possible cure.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Kidney Disease in Cats
Kidney disease is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis, looking specifically at such kidney markers as:


	
	Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): is a by-product of protein metabolism. Higher values can often indicate kidney failure.
	
	
	Creatinine (CREA): measures how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood.
	
	
	Phosphorous: elevated phosphorous levels typically indicate kidney damage.
	
	
	Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) are often affected by the primary disease—but also by secondary factors such as vomiting and a lack of appetite.
	
	
	Calcium: elevated levels, though not as common, are often seen with kidney damage.
	
	
	Red blood cell count: if low, it may indicate kidney failure.
	
	
	White blood cell count: if high, it may indicate infection or inflammation.
	
	
	Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): an additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present. It can be used for early detection of kidney disease.
	
	
	Urine specific gravity: a marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually, the higher the number, the more concentrated the urine and the greater the ability of the kidneys to conserve water.
	
	
	Urine sediment: indicates the presence of protein, bacteria, white/red blood cells, kidney cells and casts. It is an indication of  infection and/or kidney damage.
	


Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including:


	
	A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine.
	
	
	A urine culture, because cats with CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections.
	
	
	A blood pressure evaluation to determine if high blood pressure can be a cause or manifestation of kidney disease.
	
	
	Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones, infarcts (areas of dead tissue), and cysts.
	
	
	A kidney biopsy to determine the type of glomerular (filtering unit of the kidney) disease present
	


Once diagnosed, kidney disease is then classified into four stages based on the severity of clinical signs and laboratory values:


	
	Stage I: Clinical signs are usually not apparent
	
	
	Stage II: Some clinical signs are noted
	
	
	Stage III: Many clinical signs are noted and cats often appear to feel sick
	
	
	Stage IV: A majority of clinical signs are noted, and cats often present in crisis
	


Treatment of Kidney Disease in Cats
Kidney disease is managed mostly with the aid of medications, diet, and hydration. Specific management is geared toward the underlying cause (if known) as well as the stage of the disease. A cat in any stage with an increase in either UPC or high blood pressure will most likely be treated with medication.

Based on the cause, additional therapy may be instituted, such as:


	
	Aggressive IV antibiotics, if infection is present
	
	
	Deworming medication for parasites
	
	
	Immunosuppressive-type drugs for auto-immune diseases
	
	
	Antithrombotics (to prevent blood clot formation)
	
	
	Chemotherapy and/or surgery (if cancer is part of the underlying cause)
	


If a urinary obstruction is noted, relieving the obstruction would be the treatment of choice.

Throughout your cat’s life, any disease process or illness that could affect hydration should be treated promptly with IV fluids. Drugs prescribed in the future for any other disease process will need to be tailored or substituted for a more kidney-friendly alternative, given that kidney metabolism will be decreased. If not, overdosages and/or worsening of the kidney disease could occur. 

Additionally, for all stages of kidney disease, fresh water should always be available. Drinking should be encouraged and adequate nutrition should be given daily. Cats diagnosed with kidney disease are often prescribed a kidney-friendly diet which may include feeding your cat canned, wet foods that contain additional water.

Recovery and Management of Kidney Disease in Cats
Cats diagnosed early on with kidney disease will benefit from nutritional management and more frequent veterinary attention which may include more frequent checkups and blood work.

Cats in stages I and II may often be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a prescription diet specifically geared to help the kidneys by limiting the amount of work they have to do. Many cats can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months or years, depending on the specific diagnosis.   

Cats in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance:


	
	If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections can be given at the direction of your veterinarian.
	
	
	Dietary supplements may be prescribed to help with low potassium.
	
	
	Phosphorus binders may be prescribed to treat high phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can be given to cats with a poor appetite, vomiting, or nausea.
	
	
	Fluids given either intravenously or underneath the skin can help with dehydration, and your veterinarian can show you how to administer these fluids at home.
	


Because of the severity of signs often seen in cats in stages III and IV and the amount of care and effort required to support these cats, some may be humanely euthanized.

Prevention of Kidney Disease in Cats

Some causes of kidney disease may be preventable (such as toxicologic causes), but unfortunately, most causes are not. Heritable conditions, for example, are not preventable, but affected cats, or cats with the genetic copies of the disease, should not be bred.

To limit your cat’s exposure to toxins, keep lilies out of the home and block off access to the garage, household cleaners, and medications. Limiting exposure to other cats—while keeping your cat up to date on vaccines and monthly heartworm and flea control—is recommended.

If you notice any of the signs above, take your cat to a veterinarian for examination as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to maintaining quality of life.
Kidney Disease in Cats FAQsWhat is the life expectancy of a cat with kidney disease?The life expectancy of a cat with kidney disease varies depending on the underlying cause and the stage at which it is diagnosed. Cats in the earlier stages can, if the underlying disease is treated appropriately, live a normal life.
Are cats in pain with kidney disease?For most conditions listed above, I wouldn’t classify kidney disease in of itself as painful. The systemic effects and long-term implications, however, can certainly be debilitating and often lead to painful conditions.
Can a cat recover from kidney disease?Some cats that experience acute kidney insults can recover, although there may be long-term effects that can lead to chronic kidney failure. Cats in chronic kidney failure will not recover, in the sense that they will have no lingering effects of the disease, as it is not curable. However, cats can go on to live a relatively normal life, with some lifestyle changes and long-term management.

310,Kidney Disease (Congenital) in Cats,"Congenital and Developmental Renal Diseases in Cats

Congenital (existing at birth) and developmental kidney diseases are part of a group of diseases in which the kidney may be abnormal in its ability to function normally, or may be abnormal in appearance, or both. These diseases result from inherited or genetic problems or disease processes that affect the development and growth of the kidney before or shortly after birth. Most patients are less than five years of age at the time of diagnosis.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms:


	Lack of appetite
	Lack of energy
	Excessive urination
	Excessive thirst
	Weight loss
	Vomiting
	Abdominal enlargement
	Bloody urine
	Abdominal pain
	Fluid-build up under the skin


Types:


	Failure of kidney formation (renal agenesis)
	Complete absence of one or both kidneys
	Abnormal kidney development (renal dysplasia)
	Displacement of one or both kidneys (renal ectopia)
	Glomerulopathy (disease of the group of small blood vessels in the functional unit of the kidney)
	Kidney disease involving the tubules and tissue spaces (tubulointerstitial nephropathy)
	Polycystic kidney disease, characterized by formation of multiple, variable-sized cysts throughout the kidney tissue
	Dilation of small blood vessels in the kidney (renal telangiectasia), characterized by multiple blood vessel malformations involving the kidneys and other organs
	Amyloidosis of the kidney, is a group of conditions of differing causes in which insoluble proteins (amyloids) are deposited outside of cells in various tissues and organs, compromising their normal function

	Primary hyperoxaluria, a disorder characterized by intermittent high levels of oxalic acid or oxalates in the urine
	Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disorder of kidney concentrating ability, caused by diminished kidney responsiveness to an antidiuretic hormone, such that excessive urine is produced


Causes


	Hereditary
	Infectious agents may cause renal dysplasia
	Feline panleukopenia virus
	Drugs
	Dietary factors


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and any possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any information on your cat's family history that you are familiar with. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Abdominal x-rays, abdominal ultrasound and an excretory urography (x-ray of your cat urinating) will all be performed to identify and characterize the kidney disease your cat is suffering form. There are some direct genetic tests that are available for detection of specific genetic mutations associated with familial polycystic renal disease in Persian and Persian-derived breeds of cats.

 

Treatment

Treatment for patients suffering from kidney disorders is often supportive or symptomatic. Without a kidney transplant, there is no cure for developmental or congenital kidney disease. Cats with high blood pressure should be switched to a low salt diet, and cats with chronic kidney failure should have phosphorous restricted and protein intake moderately restricted.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat to monitor the progression of the kidney disease. Animals with developmental or congenital kidney disease should not be bred; neutering is highly advised under these conditions."," and Types

311,Kidney Disease Caused by Multiple Cysts in Cats,"Polycystic Kidney Disease in Cats



When large portions of a cat's renal parenchyma -- the functional tissue of the animal's kidneys which are normally differentiated -- are displaced by multiple cysts, the medical condition is referred to as polycystic kidney disease.



A cyst is a closed sac that may be filled with air, fluid, or semi-solid material. Renal cysts (a closed sac that may be filled with air, fluid, or semi-solid material) develop in pre-existing nephrons (the functional filtering cells of the kidney tissue) and in the collecting ducts of the organ. Invariably, the disease affects both of the cat's kidneys.



Although polycystic kidney disease is usually not immediately life-threatening, it should be treated as early as possible to prevent cyst progression and development of secondary bacterial infection, either of which may lead to sepsis, the presence of pus-forming toxic organisms in the blood.



Both dogs and cats may develop polycystic kidney disease, with some breeds more susceptible than others. Persian and other Persian-related breeds of cats, including Himalayans and Scottish Folds, are affected more frequently than other breeds.



If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Polycystic kidney disease may be difficult to detect in the initial stages. The cysts often remain undetected until they become large and numerous enough to contribute to kidney failure or an enlarged abdomen. Most cats do not exhibit any symptoms during initial stages of cyst formation and growth.



Once the disease has progressed, bosselated (lumpy) kidneys may be detected. This is discovered during an abdominal palpatation, in which the abdominal muscles twitch uncontrollably.



Most renal cysts are not painful, so the cat may not exhibit any discomfort, but secondary infection associated with the cysts may result in later discomfort.



Causes



Polycystic kidney disease is known to be an inherited disorder in Persian cats. Of course, the disease is not limited to this breed, as other cat breeds are susceptible to it as well.



Aside from this one known genetic factor, the exact stimuli for renal cysts is not precisely known. Environmental and endogenous factors also appear to influence the development of this disease.



Endogenous compounds that are believed to contribute to cyst development include the parathyroid hormone (a hormone secreted by the parathyroid hormones of the endocrine system) and vasopressin (a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus area of the brain).



Diagnosis



One diagnostic procedure that may be used if polycystic kidney disease is suspected is an evaluation of the fluids through fine needle aspirates of the cat's kidney (in which fluid is removed via needle), which may help to pinpoint the origination of the cysts.



Additional diagnostic procedures that may be required include abdominal ultrasounds, which may reveal the presence of cysts in some organs, a urine analysis, and an examination of cystic fluid. A bacterial culture of cyst fluids can be done to determine if secondary infection has developed and needs to be treated. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, may also be present.





If polycystic kidney disease is not the cause of the cat’s symptoms, alternate diagnoses may include an unnatural cell growth, such as tumor in the kidney, kidney failure, and a variety of other cystic diseases of the kidneys.





Treatment



Elimination of renal cysts is not possible at this time, thus treatment is often limited to minimizing the consequences of cyst formation, such as infection in the kidneys. Periodic removal of fluid from large renal cysts with a needle (a process known as aspiration) can be used to minimize pain and reduce cyst volume, and a number of medications may be prescribed to deal with symptoms and secondary complications, such as bacterial infection.



Living and Management



Cats with polycystic kidney disease should be monitored every two to six months for associated diseases, such as kidney infection, kidney failure, and increased pain. If bacterial infection and associated sepsis (the presence of pus-forming and toxic organisms in the blood) does not occur, the short-term prognosis is favorable -- even without treatment.



The long-term prognosis for cats with polycystic kidney diseases usually depends on the severity of the condition, and any subsequent progression to kidney failure.



Prevention



Because the exact cause of polycystic kidney disease is unknown, there is no specific preventative measure that can be taken. It is all but impossible to eradicate the disease through selective breeding of unaffected cats, since almost 40 percent of Persians are affected. Additionally, selective breeding may reduce genetic diversity, thereby increasing the frequency of other unwanted inherited traits in these breeds.



Owners of Persians and Persian-related breeds should be familiar with the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease so that a proactive approach can be taken.

312,Kidney Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Renal Adenocarcinoma in Cats

Adenocarcinoma of the kidneys is an extremely rare neoplasm in cats. When it does occur, it commonly affects older cats. There is no breed predisposition in cats for this type of tumor. Like other adenocarcinomas, adenocarcinoma of the kidney is very aggressive, growing rapidly and metastasizing to other parts and organs of the body. Another version of kidney adenocarcinoma, known as cystadenocarcinoma, is less aggressive; affected cats survive for longer period of time as compared to those with adenocarcinoma.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms are mostly non-specific and include:


    Gradual weight loss
    Poor appetite
    Low energy level and lethargy
    Blood in urine 


Causes

The exact cause of adenocarcinoma of kidney is still unknown. It is categorized as idiopathic.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. The doctor will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and a urinalysis to rule out or confirm other causes for these symptoms. Urinalysis remains crucial in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the kidneys, as it will provide important clues toward the final diagnosis. The presence of blood, proteins, and bacteria in the blood will be determined, and a urine culture will be performed to rule out any infectious causes. Sometimes, tumor cells are also seen in the urine, which is sufficient for establishing a preliminary diagnosis. Further diagnostics include X-ray and ultrasound imaging, which will demonstrate the presence, size, location and other important information regarding the tumor. If required, your veterinarian will also take a small tissue sample of the kidneys (kidney biopsy) to establish a confirmatory diagnosis. In some cases – as a last resort – surgery may be required to take a sample of the neoplasm for a definitive diagnosis.



Treatment

There is no single curative treatment for renal adenocarcinoma, but surgery is performed in the majority of cases. Complete resection (removal) of the carcinoma tissue, along with some normal tissue, is done. There are some chemotherapeutic agents that may also be used in some patients but the success rate is quite low. Patients with renal failure or other complications will be treated to prevent further aggravation of symptoms.

Living and Management

As no definitive treatment is available yet, cats with renal adenocarcinoma may have few months to live even if the tumor is small and well-localized. If surgery is performed, your veterinarian will recommend serial urine and blood testing along with radiographs to monitor re-growth of the tumor. These patients usually have several complications, like kidney failure, and will need to be monitored on a regular basis. During this time you can improve your cat's quality of life by keeping it comfortable and protecting it from stressful situations. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines, especially in giving chemotherapeutic agents at home. Many chemotherapeutic agents can be hazardous to your health if not handled properly; consult with your veterinarian on the best handling practices."," and Types

313,Key-Gaskell Syndrome in Cats,"Feline Dysautonomia 

Dysautonomia is characterized by a malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the system that controls the heart rate, respiration, digestion, urination, salivation, perspiration, eye pupil dilation,blood pressure, intestinal contractions, glandular activity, and physical arousal. The body functions that occur within the ANS are largely performed without conscious thought, with the exception of breathing, which works in coordination with conscious thought. This condition is also referred to as Key-Gaskell syndrome.

This is a rare condition, but when it does occur, it tends to affect cats younger than three years. Otherwise, there is no gender or age that is specifically affected. However, there is some geographical correlation tied to feline dysautonomia, with higher incidences occurring in the West and Midwest, such as California, Indiana, Kansas, and Oklahoma, as well as in the United Kingdom.

Treatment is based on the primary symptoms and the prognosis for recovery is guarded.

Causes

The underlying cause is unknown.

  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat.  You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by this condition.

X-rays will show megaesophagus (enlargement of the esophagus), distended intestinal loops with no peristalsis (the normal contraction of the intestinal muscles) and a distended urinary bladder. Loss of nerve control in the iris of the eye will cause it to be hypersensitive to cholinergic drugs, affecting the response time for the iris of the eye to contract. Where a cat unaffected with Key-Gaskell will have a normal response time of 30 minutes, a cat affected with this condition will have an abnormally fast pupil constriction reaction.

An atropine challenge test will be given to test the heart's response – a healthy cat will have a rise in heart activity (tachycardia) in response to the atropine, where a cat affected with Key-Gaskell will have no increase in heart rate.

Histamine injections may be given to test for sympathetic loss of capillary function. If there is loss of capillary function, there will be no visible reactive response in the skin, or a welt but no flare in the skin. These tests will help your veterinarian to make a compete assessment of the autonomic nervous system's (made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems) ability to function in a healthy manner.

Treatment

The cause of dysautonomia is unknown.  Thus, treatment is symptomatic.
Intravenous (IV) fluids should be given to the cat to prevent dehydration. A feeding tube may help ensure adequate nutrition if megaesophagus is present. If intestinal motility is absent, a feeding tube may be necessary.  Artificial tears should be administered if tear production is insufficient. Humidification of the air may help with dry mucous membranes. The bladder should be manually expressed for the cat.

Medications will be given for supporting the organs, and for encouraging bladder contraction and improving intestinal motility. If infections or pneumonia are suspected, antibiotics will be prescribed.
 
Living and Management

Prognosis for cats with dysautonomia is guarded. Most cats that are afflicted with this disease will not survive, as many die of aspiration pneumonia or need to be euthanized due to poor quality of life. Animals that do survive can take more than a year to fully recover and often have some degree of permanent autonomic dysfunction, which may require that they be given constant care."," and Types

314,Joint Dislocation in Cats,"Joint Luxations in Cats
 
Bones provide a rigid framework to body, helping maintain its normal shape, as well as protecting vital organs of the body. A joint is a structure where two or more bones meet (articulate) together. A capsule is present in articulating joints, which has a thick fibrous layer that helps in stabilizing the joint. In most joints, ligaments are also present, which ensure movements of joints within normal ranges. Therefore, if joints become damaged, disrupted, or undergo abnormal development, they become unstable.

The term luxation is used for the dislocation and complete disruption of a joint. In this condition, the supporting structures, like ligaments present around the joint, are damaged or completely missing. A milder form of this disease, called subluxation, represents partial dislocation of a joint.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Pain
    Swelling at site
    Inability to use affected limb
    Partial weight bearing
    Lameness

 
Causes
 
There are two basic forms of joint luxation: trauma-induced luxation or congenital, which is present at birth. The latter form is aggravated by stress at later stages.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your cat, asking you about the nature and frequency of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination on the cat, especially the areas around the joints.
 
Your veterinarian will also order multiple X-rays of the affected joints, which will help in confirming the diagnosis. This is because the results of routine laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, are usually normal in affected animals if there is no other concurrent disease present.


 


Treatment
 
The major goal of treatment is to provide complete rest in order to reduce swelling and pain. The joint may need to be stabilized to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. Bandages are usually applied to stabilize the affect joint(s), and cold compresses are applied to reduce inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be required to correct the abnormality. 
 
Living and Management
 
Cage rest in a stress-free location in your home is very important for complete recovery, as activity may increase the likelihood of further aggravation. Your veterinarian will also recommend a weight loss plan for your cat, as obesity may cause further stress on the affected joint in the long run. Recurrence after treatment is common, which makes prognosis very poor in such cases. If surgery is conducted to stabilize the joint and correction of defects, your cat may feel some soreness for a few days.
 
Your veterinarian will prescribe medications for pain control, which may need to be administered for few days at home. Call him or her if you see any untoward symptoms after surgery."," and Types

315,Joint Cartilage Erosion in Cats,"Erosive, Immune-Mediated Polyarthritis in Cats

Erosive, immune-mediated polyarthritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the joints, in which the cartilage of the cat's joint (articular cartilage) is eroded away.

Leukocyte cells, leukocyte enzymes (catalyzing reactions), cell-mediated immunity, immune complexes (an antibody bound to its triggering antigen), and autoallergic reactions are all directed against cartilage components. This leads to an inflammatory response by the tissue surrounding the cartilage, and protein activation (complement) in response to the immunity displaying cells.

Destructive enzymes, which are released from inflammatory cells, damage the articular cartilage, synoviocytes (cells which produce a lubricating fluid, called synovia, for the joints), and chondrocytes (cartilage cells), leading to erosive changes in the joints.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms for cats are often cyclic, coming and going at random intervals. These symptoms include:


    Lameness 	(ocassionally shifting-leg lameness)
    Stiffness 	in walk
    Decreased 	range of motion
    Cracking 	of the joints
    Joint 	swelling and pain in one or more joints
    Joint 	instability, subluxation, and luxation


The typical onset of immune-mediated erosive polyarthritis in cats is from one to five years of age and the most common type of the disease is feline chronic progressive polyarthritis (FCCP).

Causes

The suspected causes for this form of joint cartillage erosion are T lymphocyte effector cells that carry out the attack response, and an abnormal antigenic response to the host antibody. That is, an immune response to a substance that stimulates production of antibodies, an antigen, which acts as a “trigger.” Other known causes include:


    Idiopathic
    Feline 	leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline syncytium-forming virus (FSFV) -- 	both of which have been linked to cats with feline chronic 	progressive polyarthritis (FCPP)


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking note of signs of pain, decreased range of motion, and any lameness.

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Joint fluid aspirate will be taken for lab analysis, and submitted for bacterial culture and sensitivity. A biopsy of synovial tissue will also help to make a definitive diagnosis.

X-ray images can also be used as a diagnostic tool. If an erosive, immune-mediated polyarthritis condition is present, it will be visible on the radiograph image.



Treatment

Physical therapy, including range-of-motion exercises, massage, and swimming can help treat severe disease. Bandages and/or splints may be placed around the joint to prevent further degradation of the cartilage, especially in cats that are experiencing difficulty walking. Weight loss also helps decrease pressure on the joints if the cat is overweight.

Surgery for this condition is generally not recommended. However, total hip replacements, and femoral head ostectomy (surgical removal of part of the thigh bone) may be considered.

Arthrodesis of the carpus (wrist) is generally quite successful for treating joint pain and instability. Arthrodesis of the shoulder, elbow, stifle (knee), or hock (ankle), meanwhile, is not as reliable at yielding positive results.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule frequent follow-up appointments to examine your cat's progress. If your cat’s condition continues to worsen, you must contact your veterinarian immediately for care."," and Types

316,Joint Cancer (Synovial Sarcoma) in Cats,"Synovial Sarcoma in Cats
 
The synovial membrane is the layer of soft tissue that lines the surfaces within the joints, such as those between the joints at the knees and elbows. Synovial sarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas – malignant cancers – that arise from the precursor cells outside the synovial membrane of the joints and bursa (the fluid-filled, sac-like cavity between joints that helps to facilitate movement).
 
Precursor cells have the ability to differentiate into one or two closely related  forms: epithelial cells (skin cells) or fibroblastic (connective tissue) cells. Consequently, the tumor may have cancer resembling both cancers of the skin and of the connective tissue.

Synovial sarcomas are aggressive and highly locally invasive, spreading in greater than 40 percent of cases. They most often spread to the elbow, knee, and shoulder blade regions. This type of cancer is rare in cats. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Limping
    Slowly progressive lameness
    Palpable mass
    Weight loss
    No appetite (anorexia)    

 
Causes
 

    Unknown

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical exam and order standard laboratory tests, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other non-cancerous causes for your cat's symptoms. 
 
Visual diagnostic techniques will show abnormalities around the affected joints. X-rays of the mass will show that the tumor is involved in both the bone and the joint. To obtain a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy of the soft and bony tissue of the tumor is necessary for histologic evaluation (microscopic analysis of the tissue sample). Using fine-needle aspirates (removal of fluid), the regional lymph nodes (i.e., the lymph nodes of the groin, armpits) should also be sampled and tested for evidence of metastasis (spread). 


 
Treatment
 
The invasiveness of this type of sarcoma makes amputation (if possible) of the affected limb the treatment of choice. When appropriate, the patient should be treated with supportive chemotherapy. Pain medication will also be prescribed and administered as necessary.
 
Living and Management
 
After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication.
 
Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your cat every two to three months for the first year after diagnosis of the synovial sarcoma. After the first year your cat may be seen by your veterinarian every six months for follow-up exams, and to affirm that the cancer has not recurred. X-rays should be taken at each visit to check for local recurrence and to confirm that the cancer has not spread to the lungs."," and Types

317,"Itchiness, Desire to Scratch, Chew or Lick Causing Inflamed Skin in Cats","Pruritus in Cats

Pruritus is the medical term used to define a cat's sensation to itch, or the sensation that provokes its desire to scratch, rub, chew, or lick its hair and skin. Pruritis is also an indicator of inflamed skin. Intense scratching can eventually lead to partial or full hair loss, but with treatment, prognosis is positive.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how pruritus affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Some of the most common symptoms seen in cats include:


    Scratching
    Licking
    Biting
    Chewing
    Alopecia
    Self-trauma
    Inflammation of the skin


Causes

There are many causes of pruritus, including fleas, scabies, lice, allergies, bacterial infections, abnormal cell development (neoplasia), and immune disorders.

Diagnosis

A skin biopsy may be needed to determine the diagnosis, as there are many triggers that can cause skin itching and the desire to scratch. Allergy testing is often used to determine and localize the cause of the itching or desire to scratch.



Treatment

The treatment given will be dependent upon the underlying cause for the condition. If the cat's diet is causing the skin irritation and the desire to scratch, dietary modifications will be recommended. Medicine may be given orally, by injection, or as a medicated topical (external) ointment to minimize or eliminate the desire to scratch.

Living and Management

Pruritus requires ongoing treatment and can be frustrating for the cat's owner if progress is not made. Administering the prescribed medications will help to reduce or eliminate the desire for the cat to scratch. Dietary modifications may also be called for.

Prevention

There are currently no known preventative measures, but with maintenance and treatment, recurrence can be avoided or minimized."," and Types

318,Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Cats (IBS),"What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Cats?
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in cats is typically an acute (severe and sudden) onset episode of gastrointestinal distress.

Episodes of IBS in cats often occur in response to a stressful event, an intolerance or allergy to some component of the cat’s diet, or a change in the normal function of the colon.  

What Is the Difference Between IBS and IBD in Cats? 

While IBS in cats is severe and sudden inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) in cats is a syndrome characterized by chronic (long-term) inflammation of the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract.

IBD is usually the result of an underlying disease process such as a bacterial imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, or other genetic factors.

Definitive diagnosis of IBD requires biopsies of the stomach and intestinal tract via laparotomy (exploratory surgery) or endoscopy (investigation with a long, flexible tube).  

Cats with IBD typically have thickened intestinal walls due to the chronic inflammatory response. Cats with IBS typically have normal biopsy results.

Symptoms of IBS in Cats
The most common symptoms of IBS in cats include: 


	
	Diarrhea, which might be accompanied by mucus
	
	
	Dyschezia (painful pooping)
	
	
	Abdominal bloating/gas
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Nausea
	
	
	Vomiting 
	


Cats may also experience: 


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Gradual weight loss with persistent stress 
	


The episodes of IBS may be frequent, severe, or poorly managed.

Causes of IBS in Cats
While a definitive cause of IBS in cats is unclear, IBS typically occurs in response to a stressful event, such as:


	
	Travel 
	
	
	Boarding 
	
	
	Hospitalization 
	
	
	Trauma/injury
	
	
	Alteration of the cat’s daily routine or living environment (new home, new baby, new pet) 
	


IBS can also come from a dietary intolerance or allergy, or a change in the normal function of the bowel.

How Veterinarians Diagnose IBS in Cats
Your vet will do a physical examination, review your cat’s medical history, and ask about any recent potential stressors when diagnosing your cat with IBS. 

IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, so diagnostic tests, including CBC/blood chemistry, a fecal exam, urinalysis, serologic testing (FeLV/FIV), abdominal X-ray and/or ultrasound, may be ordered to eliminate other conditions.  

The veterinarian might also recommend intestinal biopsies to rule out other inflammatory, fungal, or neoplastic (abnormal cell growth) conditions.  

Cats with IBS may show increased spasticity (muscle stiffening) of the colon and more mucus inside the colon if a colonoscopy is performed. 

However, biopsies of the stomach and intestinal tissues are usually normal in cats with IBS.

How Veterinarians Treat IBS in Cats
Stopping the diarrhea and abdominal pain are key treatment goals for cats with IBS.  

To help your cat, your vet may administer: 


	
	Intravenous fluids to restore hydration
	
	
	Antidiarrheal medications 
	
	
	Stool softener to resolve constipation
	
	
	Antispasmodics to control colon spasms 
	


In severe cases of IBS, some cats may benefit from a short course of corticosteroids (prednisolone), antibiotics, and pre/probiotics to help relieve their symptoms.
Dietary management, stress management, and medical intervention are important long-term components for your cat’s recovery from IBS. 

Feeding Cats With IBS

Cats with IBS should be offered an easy-to-digest, high-fiber, low-fat diet to restore normal gut health and promote the return of normal, healthy stools, such as:

Recovery and Management of IBS in Cats
You can supplement your cat’s diet with probiotics to maintain a healthy bacterial flora in the gut. 

Diet Elimination Trial

Cats with a suspected dietary intolerance may also benefit from a diet elimination trial, which means placing your cat on a diet of a new protein they have never tried before.  

Specific protein intolerances may be identified with an elimination diet, although you will need to monitor your cat for several weeks to see improvement in your cat’s overall physical condition and gastrointestinal health.  

Managing Stress

Stress management is also critical for your cat to avoid recurrent bouts of IBS.  

Medications that help with anxiety, along with calming collars, sprays or diffusers, and probiotic supplements added to the diet before or after the stressful event may lessen the severity and duration of your cat’s stress.

Lifestyle management should focus on eliminating or minimizing stressors in your cat’s daily routine. Support your cat before stressful events, such as travel, boarding, or visits from family and friends, to help minimize your cat’s stress response.  

Also make sure that your cat with IBS has a nutritionally appropriate life-stage diet, regular human interaction, and daily exercise. These lifestyle elements are vital to promoting your cat’s mental health and well-being.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Cats FAQsWhat can I feed a cat with irritable bowel syndrome?Cats with IBS often respond and improve after transitioning to a hypoallergenic diet with a new protein if a dietary intolerance is suspected. 

Easy-to-digest, high-fiber, low-fat diets (Hill’s w/d) have also been shown to improve overall digestive health and alleviate the constipation, excess gas, and diarrhea associated with IBS in cats:

319,Iris Cysts,"Iridociliary Cysts in Cats

Iridociliary cysts are also sometimes known as iris cysts, ciliary body cysts or uveal cysts. In most cases, they are benign and no treatment is necessary. However, occasionally they may be large enough to interfere with vision or with the function of the eye.
 
Symptoms and Types

Iridiociliary cysts may be attached to various parts of the interior of the eye. They may be lightly or darkly pigmented and are semitransparent. They may be spherical to ovoid in shape. They can vary considerably in size and there may be more than one. They may be seen in one or both eyes.
In most cases, these cysts are an incidental finding. Only when they are large enough to impair vision or interfere with the normal functioning of the eye are they problematic. Glaucoma can be a complication associated with iridociliary cysts.

Causes

Cysts may be congenital or acquired.

    Congenital      cysts are caused by a developmental abnormality in the eye and affected      cats are born with the cysts.
    Acquired      cysts may be the result of trauma to the eye or of uveitis (inflammation      of the dark layers of the eye.) In many cases, the cause is never known.


There is a breed predilection in Siamese cats for iridociliary cysts.

Diagnosis

Iridociliary cysts are diagnosed with an ocular examination.



Treatment

In most cases, no treatment is necessary. If uveitis or glaucoma is present, these diseases will need to be treated appropriately. Laser coagulation can be used to remove particularly large cysts if necessary."," and Types

320,Iris Bombe in Cats,"Synechiae in Cats



Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye. They are the result of inflammation in the iris and are particularly common with anterior uveitis (inflammation of the dark tissues of the eye) and trauma to the eye.



Iris bombe can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Synechiae may be anterior or posterior.




	Anterior synechiae is defined as an adhesion between the iris and the cornea. The cornea is the transparent cover of the front of the eye.
	Posterior synechiae is the adherence of the iris to the capsule surrounding the lens of the eye.




Symptoms seen with synechiae include:




	Squinting
	Corneal lesions, such as ulcers
	Excessive tearing
	Glaucoma
	Variation in the color of the iris
	Opacity of the lens
	Uveitis
	Decreased papillary reaction to light




Causes




	Cat fight injury
	Chronic infection
	Corneal ulcer
	Foreign body injury to the eye
	Hyphema (bleeding in the front part of the eye)
	Penetrating wounds to the eye
	Surgery




Diagnosis



Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. In addition, dyes may be used on the cornea to detect corneal injuries. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.)







Treatment



In many cases, no treatment is necessary. If an underlying cause is diagnosed, it should be treated appropriately. In cases where glaucoma is present, laser surgery to repair the synechiae may be attempted."," and Types

321,Intestinal Virus (Reovirus) Infection in Cats,"Reovirus Infections in Cats

The reovirus is generally found in the cat's intestinal walls, destroying any cells in its surrounding area. Caused by a group of viruses that contain double-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid), a reovirus infection limits the absorption of nutrients from the intestines and results in diarrhea and dehydration.

The virus is transmitted through contact with infected feces, or by inhalation of airborne virus particles. These viruses can suppress the immune system, causing the affected animal to develop various infections. The cat's outward conditions, meanwhile, will vary and depend on the type of reovirus.

Reovirus infections can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this intestinal virus affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

A cat with a reovirus infection will usually have mild symptoms such as diarrhea and gum inflammation (gingivitis). However, it may succumb to more serious complications, including conjunctivitis, respiratory illnesses, loss of balance, muscle tremors, and ataxia.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination and complete blood profile on the cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Diagnostic procedures will be aimed at differentiating a reoviral infection from other milder respiratory infections that are caused by bacteria.



Your doctor will also need to include a detailed study of the tissue characteristics, along with the viral structure, in order to confirm a diagnosis.

Treatment

As it is generally not a life threatening condition, reovirus vaccines have not been developed and medications are usually not prescribed. Treatment, instead, will focus on ensuring your cat remains hydrated, that its airways are clear, and that its nervous system is functioning properly.

If any of the cat's body systems are disordered, your veterinarian will prescribe medication to treat its specific ailment.

Living and Management

Follow your veterinarian's advice and avoid exposing any other healthy pets to your cat. Some reoviruses are contagious, even infect children and infants at times. Therefore, it probably best to isolate your cat until it has recovered.

Be aware that some respiratory symptoms may return during your pet's recovery period. If these complications should become serious, bring your cat back to the veterinarian immediately."," and Types

Astrovirus infection is a genus of small, non-enveloped RNA virus that causes intestinal disease symptoms in affected animals. Characteristic symptoms include diarrhea and abdominal pain with watery, green diarrhea. If the diarrhea lasts longer than a week, then it is probably not caused by astrovirus, as the astrovirus generally passes in less than a week. 
 
While the astrovirus by itself is not dangerous, dehydration due to lack of fluids and diarrhea can quickly become a dangerous condition. However, fluids can be given on a temporary inpatient basis to help the cat recover. 
 
This virus is relatively rare in cats, and shows no tendency for infecting a particular breed, gender, or age. And although the astrovirus infection is communicable amongst cats, it is not communicable between cats and humans. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Green, watery      diarrhea
    Dehydration      (check for sunken eyes)
    Anorexia (no      appetite)
    Fever
    Abdominal pain
    Often more severe      in kittens

 
Causes
 
What causes a cat to become infected with the astrovirus is unknown, but it is an infectious virus that is acquired from another cat.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam, a blood profile, and a complete blood count.  
 
With gastrointestinal diseases, a swab of feces needs to be taken for laboratory analysis. A differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately, will include tests for the presence of parasites (e.g., intestinal worms), toxic ingestion, food allergy, and other viral infections that could be responsible for the symptoms. These include rotavirus, panleukopenia, or enteric coronavirus, all of which can cause the same types of symptoms. 
 
The physical exam and complete blood count will indicate to your veterinarian if and to what degree your cat is dehydrated, and how severe the infection is based on how high the white blood cell count is. The blood profile will let your veterinarian know if the diarrhea is caused by a bacteria or a virus.

   


 
Treatment
 
Treatment will depend on the final diagnosis. If your cat is dehydrated due to the diarrhea and lack of fluids, it will receive fluids to rehydrate it immediately. Medication can also be given to control the diarrhea. Your veterinarian may also prescribe a special, bland, easily digestible, high protein veterinary diet tailored for cats with intestinal upset.   
 
Living and Management
 
If astroviral infection is suspected in your cat, then you will need to keep your cat away from all other cats until the infected cat no longer has diarrhea or is displaying any other symptoms."," and Types

323,Intestinal Viral Infection (Rotavirus) in Cats,"Rotavirus Infections in Cats



The rotavirus is a double-stranded, wheel-shaped RNA virus which causes inflammation of the intestines and in severe cases, dysfunction in the intestinal walls. This virus is the leading cause of diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset in cats. And although it can be seen in cats at any age, kittens are more prone to rotavirus infections.



Dogs are also susceptible to rotavirus infections. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



The primary symptom of a rotavirus infection is mild to moderate watery diarrhea. In severe cases, cats may die from dehydration, extreme weight loss, and/or an unwillingness to eat.



Causes



The rotavirus is typically transmitted through contact with contaminated fecal matter. Cats with underdeveloped or weak immune systems and those living in overly stressed environments are most at risk for the infection.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will try to rule out the following causes for intestinal inflammation before diagnosing rotavirus: feline parvovirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline coronavirus, feline astrovirus, and feline calicivirus. Other causes for inflammation of the intestine may include fungal infections, parasites, allergies, or exposure to toxins.



Lab tests to detect the virus may include laboratory examination of tissue samples, or microscopic exploration of feces. One such test is ELISA (or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a biochemical technique. Your veterinarian may also be able to identify the virus using a technique called virus isolation.







To formally diagnose rotavirus, a veterinarian will examine the intestinal villi (the small hairs lining the intestine) and other cells within the intestinal wall, using special instruments to detect the rotavirus and antibodies the virus may have produced.





Treatment



Once the rotavirus is formally diagnosed, your veterinarian will begin treatment to ensure a prompt recovery. Treatment involves symptomatic relief to relieve the cat's diarrhea and to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Your doctor will also advise temporary dietary restrictions to help alleviate some of your cat's intestinal discomfort.



Antibiotics are generally not prescribed because they are only useful for bacterial, not viral infections.



Living and Management



Because rotaviruses are zoonotic, it is important that pet owners keep infected cats away from young children, infants in particular. When handling the fecal matter of an infected animal, it is especially important to use precautions, such as wearing latex gloves and disinfecting the animal's living area.



Humans living in developing countries are most at risk, often experiencing life-threatening diarrhea. Estimates suggest that in developing countries up to 500,000 children under age five die every year from rotavirus infections.



Prevention



The best protection for a kitten is to consume the milk of an immune cat queen, as they produce antibodies that may protect against the rotavirus.

324,Intestinal Tumors (Apudomas) in Cats,"Apudoma in Cats

Apudoma is a gastrointestinal tumor which secretes peptide hormones -- hormones that play a role in regulating metabolism, growth, development, and tissue function. In the long run, the tumor(s) can cause ulcers, damage the esophagus because of chronic reflux, and damage the lining of the intestines.

Symptoms
 

    Vomiting (sometimes with blood)
    Weight loss
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Diarrhea
    Lethargy
    Fever
    Depression
    Excessive thirst
    Tarry-looking stools
    Bloody stools (red blood)
    Abdominal pain

 
Causes
 
The cause of apudoma is currently not known.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will want to rule out the following diseases:
 

    Kidney failure
    Inflammatory gastritis
    Stress-induced ulceration
    Ulceration brought on by medication (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids)
    Uremia (condition which causes waste products to be retained in the blood)
    Other conditions associated with hyperacidity in the digestive tract and ulceration

 
Your veterinarian will then run blood tests and chemistry analysis to identify if your cat has iron-deficiency anemia as a result of the gastrointestinal bleeding. Other concerns may include inadequate protein in the blood stream and an electrolyte imbalance due to excessive vomiting.
 
In addition, an ultrasound of the abdomen can be used to determine whether there is a tumor in your cat's pancreas, and an aspirate can be used to determine if there are an any masses present  to test for mast cell disease. An endoscopy and biopsy of the upper digestive tract may also be recommended.
 
  
 
Treatment
 
Unfortunately, most apudoma tumors are cancerous (malignant) and by the time they’re discovered, it’s too late to treat them. However, aggressive medical management can sometimes relieve the symptoms and give your cat additional months (or even years) to live. Exploring a pancreatic mass surgically is important for diagnosis, but also for establishing a treatment regimen.
 
Living and Management
 
Your cat will need frequent physical examinations, as well as careful observation at home. Your veterinarian may also want to conduct X-rays and ultrasound exams from time to time to measure the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. As there is no cure for the disease, the best you can hope for is to keep your pet comfortable and pain free for a few months or years.","

325,Intestinal Tumor (Leiomyoma) in Cats,"Leiomyoma of the Stomach, Small, and Large Intestine in Cats



A leiomyoma of the stomach and intestinal tract is an unusual, but harmless and non-spreading tumor arising from the smooth muscle of the stomach and intestinal tract. The main concern is that this type of tumor can block the normal progress of fluids and solids through the digestive tract, or displace organs, resulting in secondary health complications. It typically occurs in middle-aged to older cats, generally over six years of age. Otherwise, there is no gender or breed predisposition.



Symptoms and Types



Stomach 


	Vomiting
	Often no abnormal findings 


Small intestine 


	Vomiting
	Weight loss
	Rumbling stomach
	Gas (flatulence)
	May feel mid-abdominal mass
	Occasionally distended, painful loops of small bowel


Large intestine and rectum 


	A feeling of incomplete defecation (tenesmus)
	Bright red, bloody stools (hematochezia)
	Sometimes protrusion of the rectal wall through the anus (rectal prolapse)
	May feel palpable mass during rectal examination




Causes



Unknown



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. He or she will first be looking for evidence of a foreign body in the digestive tract, or an inflammatory bowel disease, parasitic infection, or pancreatitis. 



Once a tumor has been confirmed, your veterinarian will need to differentiate it from a cancerous gland tumor. There are different types of cancerous tumors that can affect the digestive tract, including leiomyosarcoma, a cancer that grows from the smooth muscle of the digestive tract; and lymphoma, a solid neoplasm that originates in the lymphocytes -- a type of white blood cell in the bloodstream.







A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor may need to order an abdominal ultrasound, which may reveal a thickened wall of the stomach or bowel. Gastric leiomyoma is most common at the esophageal–gastric junction, where the esophagus meets the stomach cavity. If necessary, a special imaging technique called a contrast study may be used. This study will involve giving the cat an oral dose of liquid material (barium) that shows up on X-rays. Films are then taken at various stages to examine the passage of the barium through the body. This technique may reveal a space-occupying mass in the digestive tract. Double-contrast radiography of the large intestine and rectum may also be used to reveal a space-occupying mass in these organs.



Your veterinarian may also perform an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, by which a flexible tube with an attached camera is inserted into the space to be examined, in this case the gastrointestinal tract, allowing the doctor to visually inspect the space for abnormalities. These devices also have attachments for gathering samples of tissue and fluid, so that a biopsy can be performed to confirm the preemptive diagnosis. If a tumor is suspected, your doctor will need to perform a mucosal biopsy, and if possible, will take a tissue sample of the mass in the gastrointestinal tract. This method is often not useful for the diagnosis of deep tumors. In these cases, a more invasive surgical biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis.





Treatment



Surgical resection (removal) is the treatment of choice. This method is generally curative if the tumor can be removed safely. In many cases, owing to their benign nature, even large leiomyomas with narrow margins can be removed successfully.



Living and Management



If your doctor is able to perform a complete resection, normal postoperative care will be required; no additional follow-up will be necessary. However, your doctor will want to monitor your cat's blood glucose postoperatively, particularly if your cat was hypoglycemic (low in blood sugar) prior to surgery.

326,Intestinal Protein Loss in Cats,"Protein Losing Enteropathy in Cats

Nutrients make their way through the body by way of the bloodstream. From the stomach, the food that has been eaten enters into the intestines, where it is divided into what is useful for the body and what is not. The useful, nutritious bits are picked up by the bloodstream as it passes through the intestines, carrying them to the rest of the body, where they are converted into various types of energy.

As the bloodstream picks up these nutrients, a small amount of protein leaks from the blood vessels back into the intestines. Usually these proteins are digested in the intestines, absorbed back into the blood, and used by the body to make more protein, but when the intestines are damaged, more protein leaks out into the intestines than the body can replace. This condition is referred to as protein losing enteropathy (enteropathy being any abnormal condition relating to the intestines). There are a number of diseases that can damage the intestines enough to cause this extra protein loss.

Protein losing enteropathies can occur in any cat breed and at any age.

Symptoms and Types


    Occasional bouts of diarrhea
    Chronic diarrhea
    Weight loss
    Lack of energy (lethargy)
    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Enlarged abdomen
    Legs and feet may be puffy or 	swollen (edema)


Causes


    Cancer in the intestines
    Infection in the intestines
    Bacteria such as salmonella
    Fungal infection
    Intestinal parasites like 		hookworms and whipworms
    Inflammation of the intestines 	(inflammatory bowel disease)
    Food Allergies
    Stomach or intestinal ulcers
    Congestive heart failure
    Problems with the movement of  	lymphatic fluid out of the intestines (lymphangiectasia)


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. A thorough physical examination will be performed, and will include standard laboratory work – a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis. Your veterinarian will use these samples to determine your cat's blood protein level and blood calcium level. There are several causes that will need to be ruled out in order to make a diagnosis. Your veterinarian will order stool (fecal) tests to check for intestinal parasites, intestinal infections, and other indicators that your cat is losing protein from its intestines.



Your veterinarian may also check the blood vitamin levels, which will be low if your cat is losing protein from its intestines. X-ray and ultrasound images of your cat's chest and abdomen will allow your veterinarian to visually examine these internal structures for evidence of internal ulcerations or tumors, and will also display the heart's capabilities, and whether its performing abnormally. If your veterinarian needs a better visual of the stomach and intestines than external devices can provide, an endoscopy may be performed for a better view. In this test, a small camera, attached to a tube, is passed through the mouth or anus into the intestines so that the walls of the stomach and intestinal tract can be closely inspected for ulcers, tissue masses (tumors), or abnormalities in the wall or cell structure. The endoscopic device also allows for taking samples of tissue while it is inserted, and is a much less invasive method for performing a biopsy. Bioptic analysis is an especially useful diagnostic tool for determining why an animal is losing protein through its intestines.

Treatment

Treatment will depend on the underlying disease that is causing your cat to lose protein through its intestines. If your cat's protein level is dangerously low, it may need a transfusion to replace some of the blood protein.

Living and Management

In most cases there is no cure for protein loss through the intestines. Your veterinarian will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help you manage your cat's symptoms, including a diet that will ensure that the best possible amount of nutrients are being absorbed by your cat's body. During follow-up visits, complete blood counts and biochemical profiles will be done to make sure that your cat's blood protein level is stable and not becoming dangerously low. Your veterinarian will also check your cat to make sure it is not having trouble with breathing and does not have fluid built up in its belly.

Encourage your cat to relax by giving it a quiet space in which to withdraw when the house is active, away from children and other pets."," and Types

327,Intestinal Parasitic Infection (Strongyloidiasis) in Cats,"Strongyloidiasis in Cats   Strongyloidiasis is an uncommon intestinal infection with the parasite Strongyloides tumefaciens, causing grossly visible nodules and diarrhea. (It is also possible for cats to develop an infection with the parasite S. stercoralis, but there has not yet been a reported case in the United States.) S. tumefaciens is relatively host-specific, but there is a potential for transmission to humans.  Symptoms and Types       Inflammation of the skin, rash 	(dermatitis)     Cough, bronchopneumonia     Diarrhea or constipation, 	especially in newborn kittens     Blood in stool     Mucus in stool   Causes  There are several ways your cat may become infected with S. tumefaciens, including skin penetration, ingestion of contaminated feces, and nursing from an infected bitch. There is an increased prevalence of stronglyoidiasis in kennels, especially when there is poor sanitation and high temperatures and humidity.  Diagnosis  The challenge your veterinarian will face will be distinguishing the cause of the cat's symptoms, which may be due to several other parasites or bacteria or viruses. He or she may culture a sample of your cat's feces, or perform a colonoscopy on the animal to identify the infective agent and check for a firm colon, which is commonly associated with S. tumefaciens.  Treatment  Unless intravenous fluid supplementation is needed to stabilize your dehydrated cat, it will be treated as an outpatient. Preferred anthelmintic medication, which destroy and remove internal parasites, include ivermectin and fenbendazole.  Living and Management  Your veterinarian will want to schedule monthly fecal examinations monthly for the first six months after treatment to assure clearance of infection. During this time, your cat will intermittently shed parasitic larvae and require regular deworming sessions. He or she will also recommend a thorough cleaning of your pet's area and/or kennel to eradicate any potential larvae. You should, however, take precaution when handling the cat or items used by the animal, as humans can sometimes become infected with S. tumefaciens., causing rashes, severe abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea."," and Types       Inflammation of the skin, rash 	(dermatitis)     Cough, bronchopneumonia     Diarrhea or constipation, 	especially in newborn kittens     Blood in stool     Mucus in stool   "
328,Intestinal Parasite (Cryptosporidium) in Cats,"Cryptosporidiosis in Cats



Cryptosporidium is an intestinal parasite that is commonly ingested through contaminated water, food or feces. The resulting diseased condition, cryptosporidiosis, can typically be treated effectively with medications. This disease is no more likely to affect one breed than another, and is commonly seen in kittens.



Symptoms and Types



The most common symptoms of cryptosporidiosis are fever and diarrhea. Cats will also display intolerance for food, or in more serious cases, will suffer from organ disease. Other symptoms include lethargy and intolerance for exercise.



Causes



Risk factors include the ingestion of contaminated food or water, the ingestion of animal feces, and intestinal infection. When the cryptosporidium parasite is ingested in the oocyst stage, it is transferred into the body of the host cat. It then develops into a sporozoite, the division and development stage, and proceeds to spread and infect the cells throughout the body. Kittens are at heightened risk of complications due to infestation, since their immune systems are less developed. Bloody diarrhea and dehydration can quickly lead to fatality.



Diagnosis



A fecal sample will be taken to determine what the underlying cause is for the issue. The parasite will be found in the course of the fecal examination.









Treatment



Treatment for cryptosporidiosis is generally on an outpatient basis, with the recommendation to limit food until the diarrhea has subsided, along with an increase in fluids to combat dehydration. Boil your cat's drinking water to assure that it is clean. For healthy cats, their immune system will fight the parasite and the condition will generally run its course without treatment. Young, old, and immune-compromised animals may need medication and guarded care to prevent internal complications. Prescribed medications, if given, must be followed through to completion.



Living and Management



Following treatment, monitoring your cat for signs of improvement is recommended. Overall, prognosis is excellent if the immune system is strong.



Prevention



The most preventative measure available for this disease is to make sure that your cat is in a clean environment, and is not eating animal feces or drinking dirty water, as it could be contaminated with the cryptosporidium organism that causes this condition."," and Types



The most common symptoms of cryptosporidiosis are fever and diarrhea. Cats will also display intolerance for food, or in more serious cases, will suffer from organ disease. Other symptoms include lethargy and intolerance for exercise.

329,Intestinal Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach, Intestine, or Rectum in Cats



Adenocarcioma is a malignant tumor that may occur in the gastrointestinal (GI) system of a cat. It can occur in any part of the GI system, including the stomach, the small and large intestine, and the rectum. This tumor is rare in cats, but when it does occur older cats are the most commonly affected. No particular cat breed is known to be predisposed, though it is more common in males than females. The prognosis for cats with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is usually poor.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms are most commonly related to the gastrointestinal system and include:




	Vomiting
	Weight loss
	Poor appetite
	Abdominal pain
	Hematemesis (vomiting of blood)
	Melena (black colored feces due to hemorrhage in the GI system)
	Bright red blood in feces
	Tenesmus (difficulty with defecation)




Causes



The exact cause is still unknown, this condition is classified as idiopathic.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Blood tests, fecal tests and a biochemistry profile will be performed. The blood tests usually show mild to severe anemia, mainly due to gradual blood loss through the feces. A sample of the feces will also be examined under microscope to look for the presence of hidden blood. Contrast radiography (using a contrast chemical agent) may reveal the presence, location, and size of the neoplasm. Ultrasound is also a valuable tool in the diagnosis of adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. Using ultrasound, your veterinarian may decide to take a fluid sample through a fine needle to examine for the presence of neoplastic cells in sample fluid. An endoscope is also sometimes used for sample collection. If none of the above mentioned procedures are helpful in confirming a diagnosis, your veterinarian may decide to perform surgery, which will ultimately confirm the assumed diagnosis.







Treatment



Surgery is the treatment of choice in adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal system, but a cure is seldom achieved because metastasis is common in affected patients. In cases of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, it is often difficult to remove neoplastic tissue. In cases of neoplasm of the intestines, the affected portion is removed and the normal portions of the intestine are then sutured together. Chemotherapy may be advised but it is usually unsuccessful. Pain killers are advised for lessening the pain associated with this neoplasm.



Living and Management



If surgery is performed on your cat, you may need to return to your attending veterinarian every three months after the surgery. At every visit, your veterinarian will perform the physical examination, take X-rays, and perform ultrasound to see if the tumor is re-growing or not.



These tumors characteristically grow rapidly, metastasizing to other parts and organs of the body. In case of gastric adenocarcinoma, the survival time is usually two months, whereas in cases of intestinal neoplasm, few affected cats are reported to survive more than one year. However, survival time is variable and can only be predicted by your veterinarian after a complete evaluation of your cat."," and Types

330,Intestinal Blockage in Cats,"What Is Intestinal Blockage in Cats?
An intestinal blockage (obstruction) is a common emergency condition that occurs when there is a partial or complete blockage of the intestines that prevents solids or liquids from passing through.  

Gastrointestinal obstruction and intestinal blockage are medical terms that are often used interchangeably for the same condition. However, while a gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction could include an intestinal blockage, the reverse is not true, as an intestinal blockage applies only to the intestines and GI applies to the entire digestive tract (the stomach and small and large intestines).  

Normally, the GI tract undergoes a process called peristalsis, where food and contents are pushed from the stomach to the small intestines, then to the large intestines, into the colon, and out of the rectum and anus. When an obstruction occurs, nothing can pass through. As a result, contents can be backed up into the stomach and your cat may vomit.

GI obstruction is a surgical emergency. Left untreated, it can result in the death of your cat. If you believe your cat has an intestinal or GI blockage, contact your local emergency veterinarian immediately.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Intestinal Blockage in Cats
Cats diagnosed with a GI obstruction are most often brought to the vet for vomiting and lack of appetite. Other symptoms may include:


	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Failure to pass stool
	
	
	Straining to defecate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in behavior (increase in hiding)
	
	
	Weight loss
	


It’s important to mention to your veterinarian if your cat has a habit of playing with string or getting into the garbage—or if you’ve witnessed your cat chewing and/or swallowing something inappropriate.

As cats tend to ingest string and similar items while playing with them, these objects have been known to become lodged under the tongue. If you or your veterinarian notice something under the tongue, or if you notice material protruding from your cat’s rectum, do not pull on it! It is often tethered elsewhere and can cause more harm if you attempt to remove it.

Causes of Intestinal Blockage in Cats
GI obstruction can result from a variety of causes, and an obstruction can be partial, linear, or complete:


	
	A partial obstruction of the GI tract is usually seen with small foreign objects, such as small toys or pieces of cloth, making their way through the intestines. Signs are generally less noticeable, and medical management, including hospitalization for IV fluids to help the item pass, may be an option in these cases.
	
	
	In a linear obstruction, a linear foreign body is ingested, something string-like. But instead of passing through the intestines, one end of the object/string becomes stuck. This often happens when one end becomes lodged under the tongue. When one end becomes stuck, the intestines still try to move around the free end. This movement (peristalsis) causes a bunching effect (plication) of the intestines around the string. The longer the string is present, the greater the chance that the string can cut through the intestines, causing tears (perforations) that result in intestinal contents spilling into the abdominal cavity. This can lead to life-threatening inflammation and an infection called peritonitis. 
	
	
	Complete obstructions can occur when large objects or multiple small objects have been swallowed and there is a complete lack of passage of stomach or intestinal contents down the tract. Symptoms usually present quickly and severely.  
	


 Whether partial, linear, or complete obstruction is noted, the underlying cause may be due to the following:


	
	Ingestion of foreign objects, most commonly string, yarn, dental floss, hair ties, or rubber bands
	
	
	Intussusception (an uncommon telescoping of one intestine into itself), which can occur secondary to parasites, infection (such as FIP), tumors, or foreign-body ingestion
	
	
	Certain types of GI cancer
	
	
	Pyloric stenosis, usually seen as a congenital condition where the pylorus (the part of the stomach that connects to the small intestine) is narrowed, limiting the passage of food
	
	
	Intestinal entrapment or hernias
	


Partial, linear, or complete blockages can prevent the absorption of nutrients and water from the intestines, resulting in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Even more dangerous if not treated quickly, the foreign body creating the blockage can put pressure on the intestinal wall (or even cut through the wall as noted above with linear foreign bodies), causing tissue death (necrosis) and bowel rupture with life-threatening consequences.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Intestinal Blockage in Cats
Your veterinarian will start with a physical examination to palpate the abdomen for pain or evidence of masses/foreign bodies/intussusception. In young or thin cats, the vet may be able to palpate the actual obstruction itself. But often the cat is too large or the obstruction too small to palpate it directly in an exam. 

If no blockage is detected on physical examination but the vet is still concerned there may be one, they will likely perform an abdominal x-ray. If the blockage is a foreign object, particularly if it contains metal, it may be visible on an x-ray. However, if the obstruction is from a string, yarn, or one of the other causes such as a tumor, it may not be directly visible. An “obstructive” gas pattern may be seen where the intestines next to the obstruction are dilated with air or fluid that cannot get through. Linear foreign bodies may show plicated or bunched intestines. 

If the x-ray is inconclusive or your vet is looking for additional information prior to recommending surgery, they may perform an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound is useful at visualizing foreign bodies (including linear foreign bodies) but will also provide more information if a tumor or intussusception is suspected. Bloodwork will likely also be recommended to rule out other causes of the symptoms and to assess hydration and electrolytes. 

Treatment of Intestinal Blockage in Cats
Based on the type and cause of obstruction present, your cat may require one of the following treatments:

Induced vomiting: Depending on the foreign body and when your cat ate it, sometimes vomiting can be immediately induced to recover the foreign object and prevent the intestinal blockage from occurring. However, medications used to induce vomiting in cats are not always reliable, and cats can have complications such as aspiration pneumonia associated with inducing vomiting.  

Endoscopy: If your cat has eaten a foreign object that is still in the stomach and attempts by the vet to force vomiting are unsuccessful, they may suggest endoscopy. This involves using a camera to pass down the throat to visualize and retrieve the foreign object, avoiding obstruction and surgery. 

If your cat eats a linear object (string, yarn) or other small foreign body (toy, hairband) and it does not become lodged somewhere higher in the gastrointestinal tract (under tongue, in stomach), there is a chance it can pass in their stool. However, if any foreign object (linear or otherwise) becomes stuck and creates an intestinal blockage, surgery will be needed to locate and remove the blockage. 

Surgery: Most commonly, intestinal blockage will require surgery. The veterinarian will perform exploratory surgery (laparotomy) under general anesthesia to find the cause of the intestinal obstruction. If the obstruction was caused by a foreign body, an incision will be made into the intestines (enterotomy) to remove the object. In the case of linear foreign bodies, sometimes several enterotomies are needed to remove the entire length of the object.

Unfortunately, if there was severe damage to the intestines, compromised sections of intestines may need to be removed (resection and anastomosis). If the obstruction was caused by one of the other causes (not a foreign body), the surgeon would relieve the obstruction and determine the best course of action, which may include repairing a hernia or removing a tumor. Surgery is not without risks, but for many cases, it poses the best chance at a successful outcome. Be sure to discuss what the risks could be with your veterinarian.

Supportive care: Your cat will be given IV fluids (to rehydrate them) and administered medications for nausea and pain. Often, cats in recovery from major abdominal surgery will sometimes not eat even after the obstruction has been successfully removed. In some cases, they will need a temporary feeding tube to help provide nutritional support while they heal. Your veterinarian will discuss the best course of action for your pet. 

Recovery and Management of Intestinal Blockage in Cats
Diagnosing and treating intestinal blockages as soon as possible is key to achieving the best outcome and minimizing complications such as damage to the intestines, intestine rupture, leakage, or peritonitis). If your cat is diagnosed with an intestinal blockage and surgery is needed, it should be performed as soon as possible. 

If sections of the intestine must be removed, the likelihood of complications increases, but your cat may still have a good prognosis overall. If the underlying cause of the obstruction is due to cancer or anything other than a foreign body obstruction, the prognosis is lower and would depend on the extent and severity of the condition. 

Most cats will need to remain hospitalized for 1-2 days after surgery on IV fluids with medications for pain and sometimes appetite stimulation. The typical criteria for being discharged is as long as the cat is eating, there is no vomiting, and the cat is fever-free. Once at home, the recovery for most abdominal surgeries includes 10-14 days of rest and restricted activity. The incision site is checked frequently for swelling and for signs of infection such as discharge, odor, redness, and pain. The cat’s overall behavior and willingness to eat and drink must also be monitored.

If any problems are noted, reach out to your veterinarian to have your cat reexamined. Adhere to the vet’s directions about diet and medications.

Most cats make a complete recovery, but prognosis can vary based on the cause of the intestinal blockage. If your cat had an obstruction due to a foreign body ingestion, you must be vigilant to prevent reoccurrence. Access to trash, hair ties, string, and other objects must be restricted. If a tumor is identified as the cause of the blockage, a sample can be submitted to a lab to help determine the type of tumor and a prognosis.
Intestinal Blockage in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat survive with a blockage?Cats with a partial obstruction often survive longer than those with a complete obstruction, although timing is variable. If your pet has any of the clinical signs associated with intestinal blockage, especially vomiting, lack of appetite, or straining to defecate with no stool produced, it is important that you seek veterinary care immediately. If a cat is diagnosed with an intestinal blockage, surgery is then recommended as soon as possible.  
Can a cat pass an intestinal blockage?  Sometimes, yes. If the blockage is secondary to a small foreign body the pet ingested and is only causing partial obstruction, the object can often pass through the gastrointestinal tract in the stool. IV or subcutaneous fluid therapy may be recommended to ease dehydration and help the object pass. Also, x-rays may be used to track the progress of the object as it moves through. However, complete blockage can occur along with trauma to the GI tract while waiting for the object to pass; always discuss options with your veterinarian.

Cats diagnosed with a GI obstruction are most often brought to the vet for vomiting and lack of appetite. Other symptoms may include:


	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Failure to pass stool
	
	
	Straining to defecate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in behavior (increase in hiding)
	
	
	Weight loss
	


It’s important to mention to your veterinarian if your cat has a habit of playing with string or getting into the garbage—or if you’ve witnessed your cat chewing and/or swallowing something inappropriate.

As cats tend to ingest string and similar items while playing with them, these objects have been known to become lodged under the tongue. If you or your veterinarian notice something under the tongue, or if you notice material protruding from your cat’s rectum, do not pull on it! It is often tethered elsewhere and can cause more harm if you attempt to remove it.

331,Inter-cat Aggression,"Aggression between Cats

 

Bringing a new cat into a home where there is already a cat, or cats, can cause some problems -- both passive and active aggression. Females will usually live peaceably with each other. However, if aggression and conflict rear their ugly heads in a household of formerly nonviolent female cats, it’s probably because one has reached the status of social maturity, which occurs at around four years of age. In addition, non-neutered males will aggressively compete for mates.



When the cat is introduced to your other pets, the most typical behavior is active aggression -- the resident cat goes after the intruder, biting, hissing, and scratching. Some cats are very confident and will not back down, regardless of the size of the other cat. Also, very confident cats will often use passive aggression. In this case, a stare and a lowering of the head are all that are required to bring the other cat into submission.



Symptoms and Types 



Overt Aggression  

Overt aggression is any hostile behavior that is obvious. The most clear sign of aggression is attacking and fighting, but before that there are other signs that can be observed; clear indications that there is going to be trouble. If you become aware of this behavior, you can be sure that without intervention, there is going to be a fight.



Behavior typical of the aggressor includes staring the other cat down, hissing and swiping at the other cat, raising its back and hackles (the erectile hairs on the back are raised), and thrashing its tail back and forth. Involuntary physical reactions to aggression will also show. The ears will be flattened back against the head, and the eyes will be dilated. The aggressor will mark areas of the home to establish its dominance, either by using the scent glands under its chin, or by urinating.



Covert Aggression  

Covert aggression is less apparent. The aggressor will use different methods to keep its rival away from resources like food and water, the litter box, and sleeping areas. Human attention will also be an opportunity for the aggressor cat to show its dominance, as it will block the other cat from receiving attention or even getting near to people. Favored areas of the victim cat may be marked by the aggressor, causing the victim to avoid those areas. The victim will urinate and defecate in other places in the house if it is kept away from the litter box.



Causes 



Inter-cat aggression can be caused by a decrease in individual space, usually due to overcrowding, or because a new cat has been brought into the household. It can also be due an illness or a disruption in the household, such as moving or hospitalization of one of the cats.



Diagnosis 



Your veterinarian will want to rule out a physical cause for your cat’s behavior before making recommendations for solving the problem. If it is determined to be a physical cause, appropriate treatment will be prescribed. For instance, blood tests may reveal hyperthyroidism. Other physical conditions that can cause your cat to behave unusually are brain lesions, and urinary tract disorders.



If there is no evidence showing that the behavior is rooted in a physical problem, your doctor will consider behavioral conditions. This can range from incomplete socialization with other cats; fear aggression, or not having the psychological resources to deal with situations it is not accustomed to; and territorial aggression, where the cat has decided that it is going to settle a piece of turf as its own and will defend it.



If the behavior is not due to any physical ailments, anti-anxiety medication or behavioral modification may be recommended.





Living and Management 



Now it is up to you. Begin by putting the aggressor in a less-desirable room behind a locked door with food, water, and a litter box. The victim cat, on the other hand, should be allowed to roam freely and have access to the more favorable areas. If there are more than two cats, group them by personality, but keep the ""bullies"" alone.



The aggressors should only be allowed out when they can be supervised. At the first sign of aggression, it needs to return to the less-desirable room. You may want to try leashes and harnesses to gain control of the animals. In addition, put a bell on the aggressor so the other cats always know where it is. Use rewards to condition cats to each other, such as treats, massage, and grooming. Do not use physical punishment...ever. It will only make things worse.



In most cases, behavior-modification methods work, however, it may some time to see a difference in the cat and there may be relapses. Establishing dominance over your pets is important. Your cats may never form close bonds, but they should be able to share a living space."," and Types

332,Insufficient Urine Production in Cats,"Oliguria and Anuria in Cats



Oliguria is the medically defined term for a condition in which an abnormally small amount of urine is produced by the body - with urine production at a rate of less than 0.25 milliliters per kilogram per hour. Anuria is the medical term used to describe a condition in which essentially no urine is produced by the body, with urine production at a rate of less than 0.08 milliliters per kilogram per hour.



Physiologic oliguria occurs when the kidneys limit loss of renal water in order to preserve body fluid and electrolyte balance. Pathologic oliguria results from severe impairment of kidney tissues, which can occur as the result of a number of factors. Anuria may result from kidney disease, or obstruction of urinary flow.



Symptoms and Types



Generally, a key symptom of oliguria or anuria is a decreased amount of urine being produced and excreted. Additional symptoms vary depending on the type of oliguria or anuria present. Signs of physiologic oliguria include dehydration, pale mucous membranes, a weak pulse, a rapid or irregular pulse, and a history of fluid loss (through excessive vomiting or diarrhea, for example). Signs of pathologic oliguria typically include a history of progressive kidney disease with symptoms such as poor appetite and weight loss. Signs of anuria may be observed during a physical examination, with revealing symptoms such as fluid infiltration into the tissues surrounding the urinary tract, and pain in the abdomen on palpation.



Causes



Various conditions may be responsible for different types of oliguria and anuria. Physiologic oliguria may be occasioned by renal hypoperfusion, which is caused by low blood volume or blood pressure, or hypertonicity, an increased pressure of fluids in the body. Pathologic oliguria is usually due to acute (sudden) kidney failure, or chronic kidney disease. Anuria may result from a complete obstruction in the urinary tract, a rupture in the urinary excretory pathway, or from very severe kidney failure.



A number of risk factors may increase the odds of developing oliguria or anuria, including dehydration, low blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, trauma, such as from a car accident, sugar diabetes, and multiple organ failure.



Diagnosis



Key diagnostic procedures include an urethrocystoscopy, which uses an insertable diagnostic tool to view the interior of the urinary tract and bladder wall, and which may provide evidence for obstruction or rupture of the urinary tract. Additional tests may include urine analysis, an electrocardiograph (ECG), abdominal radiographs and ultrasounds to rule out or confirm a urinary obstruction.







Treatment



Oliguria and anuria are medical emergencies that require immediate treatment. If left untreated, these conditions can lead to death within hours or days. Proper treatment is dependent upon the cause of the condition. Renal hypoperfusion, if present, needs to be corrected by intravenous (IV) administration of a normal saline solution or similar fluid. Once the renal hypoperfusion is corrected, a diuretic medication to encourage urine production and flow may be prescribed. Is there is an obstruction in the urinary tract, such as abnormal tissue growth in the form of a neoplasm (tumor), this will need to be removed.



In cases of primary oliguria and anuria, treatment is limited to addressing the symptoms and supporting the patient long enough for spontaneous recovery of kidney function to occur. Elimination of causative factors may stop or slow further kidney damage.



Living and Management



It is essential that your cat's urinary flow rate be monitored so that signs of progress can be tracked. A urinary catheter may be necessary to accurately determine urine volume, but it is important to place and clean catheters properly to avoid the development of a bacterial urinary tract infection. Your veterinarian will advise you on the best way to go forward with this procedure.



Prevention



Due to the fact that there are such a wide variety of causes for oliguria and anuria, there is no one specific prevention method that can be suggested. A generally healthy lifestyle may be helpful."," and Types

333,Insecticide Toxicity in Cats,"Organophosphate and Carbamate Toxicity



Areas that are geographically prone to heavy flea and tick infestations tend to use many different forms of insecticide (e.g., organophosphates and carbamates). But exposure to insecticides -- especially after heavy or repeated applications of the chemicals -- may be toxic to cats.



These forms of insecticide poisoning affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs please this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Cats exposed to toxic chemicals may not exhibit all of the signs of poisoning. In fact, sometimes insecticides will cause the opposite of these symptoms instead, but there will usually be some indication that the cat is not well. If you suspect that your pet is unwell because of exposure to insecticides, you will need to remove your cat from the toxic environment, or cease using the insecticides, and seek medical attention for it before the condition becomes dire.



The following are some of the symptoms of toxic poisoning:




	Fever
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Anorexia
	Depression
	Seizures
	Muscle tremors
	Hypersalivation
	Constricted pupils
	Increased heart rate
	Lack of coordination (i.e., trouble walking)
	Respiratory failure (e.g., trouble breathing)




Toxic levels of carbamate insecticides like methomyl and carbofuran can cause seizures and respiratory arrest in your cat. Organophosphate toxicity, meanwhile, may lead to chronic anorexia, muscle weakness and muscle twitching which may last for days or even weeks. Someorganophosphate insecticides commonly used include coumaphos, cyothioate, diazinon, fampfhur, fention, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos.



This same kind of poisoning can occur with agricultural, lawn and garden insecticide products. Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl.

Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos (which is especially toxic to cats), diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl.



Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides inhibit cholinesterases and acetylcholinesterase, essential enzymes in the body. Cholinesterases are enzymes which break down acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter.



Consequently, acetylcholine remains attached to the postsynaptic receptors of the neurons causing continuous, unending nervous transmission to nervous tissue, organs and muscles (smooth and skeletal). This causes seizures and shaking.



Causes



Toxicity can occur due to the overuse, misuse, or use of multiple cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides; overexposure to insecticides in the surrounding home environment; the misuse of organophosphate insecticides in cats (e.g., organophosphate-containing dips labeled for dogs only, inappropriately applied to cats); or the intentional application of house or yard insecticides on cats.



Diagnosis



If your cat has been diagnosed as having toxic levels of insecticide in its system, your veterinarian will immediately stabilize and decontaminate your pet. Your veterinarian will also administer an antidotal treatment to your cat.



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. If you know what type of toxin your pet was exposed to, or you have a sample of it, you should take a sample with you so that your doctor can better treat the poisoning. Your veterinarian will then send a sample of whole blood to a laboratory experienced in handling animal samples. A positive result is confirmed when cholinesterase in the blood is less than 25 percent of normal levels.





Treatment



Depending on how long it has been since your cat ingested the toxin (if exposure was via ingestion), you veterinarian may induce vomiting for your pet. Your doctor may also wash out it’s stomach with a tube (lavage), and then give it activated charcoal to detoxify and neutralize any remaining insecticide. Antidotal treatments specific to the toxin will also be given to your pet. Further treatment may include an oxygen cage if your pet is having trouble breathing, and fluid therapy if your pet has been unable to drink or is anorexic.



Cats suffering from seizures will be given anti-seizure medication to stop the seizures. If exposure to the toxin came through the skin, your veterinarian will use specialized wash for removing the residue from the hair and skin of your pet.

 

Living and Management



The sooner your cat is treated after being exposed to organophosphate or carbamate insecticides, the better the prognosis is. Organophosphate toxicity in cats may last two to four weeks, but most patients will fully recover with the aid of aggressive care. Avoid using insecticides -- flea or tick treatments -- on sick or debilitated cats, as it will affect the body more easily because of the weakened immune system.



If your cat needs to be treated for pests while it is recovering, or if it is sick for any other reason, ask your veterinarian to recommend some alternatives to chemical treatments. Organophosphates and carbamates both inhibit cholinesterases enzymes; giving both at the same time is likely a toxic dose of insecticide.



And as always, read the instructions on the insecticide labels before using them.

335,Inherited Skin Disease in the Persian Cat,"Feline Idiopathic Seborrhea



Persian cats are known to inherit a disorder called idiopathic seborrhea. This primary skin disease leads to overproduction of an oily, waxy substance by the skin glands, which clumps in the fur and causes a bad smell.



Though often seen in Persians, seborrhea can affect various breeds of cat and typically in the same way -- the skin becomes red and irritated, which leads to scratching and further cellular damage.



Symptoms and Types



There are two common forms of seborrhea: seborrhea sicca, in which the skin becomes more dry and flaky; and seborrhea oleosa, in which the skin becomes more oily. Most animals with inherited seborrhea have a combination of the two forms.



Seborrhea in cats tends to affect the skin along the back and around the eyes and ears. It also causes irritation in those areas where the skin folds, such as in the armpits; on the underside; around legs; and on the face, feet, and neck.



Causes



In the primary (also called idiopathic, or unknown) form of the inherited disease, the cause of seborrhea is unknown. In the case of a secondary seborrhea, the cause may be due to an underlying problem, which can include:




	Parasites
	Fungal infections
	Allergies
	Dietary problems
	Endocrine disorders
	Obesity




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will do a physical examination and check your cat for any disease that may cause a secondary seborrhea. Tests that may be used include:




	Chemistry panel
	Complete blood count (CBC)
	Hormone analysis
	Skin scraping
	Bacterial culture
	Fungal culture
	Skin biopsy




Once every other potential cause of the condition is ruled out, a diagnosis of primary idiopathic seborrhea can be made. If your cat is a Persian, the vet will have an even easier time making the diagnosis, as they are prone to idiopathic seborrhea.





Treatment



As it is not possible to cure idiopathic seborrhea, treatment will mainly focus on controlling the condition. This may include using a combination of shampoos and conditioners to control the amount of oily buildup and calm the itchy skin. Your veterinarian may also prescribe oral vitamin or fatty acid supplements.



If your cat contracts a secondary infection, other therapies such as antibiotics (oral and topical), antifungals, and sometimes allergy medications may be necessary.



Living and Management



Keep your pet clean and well hydrated. This will help control the condition and reduce the chances that a secondary infections develop. In addition, schedule regular follow-up exams with your veterinarian to monitor the cat's skin condition."," and Types

336,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in Cats: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Inflammatory bowel disease is actually a group of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases for which no single cause is known. Also known as IBD, inflammatory bowel disease in cats results in the inflammation of the stomach, small intestines, and/or large intestines.

This can be a frustrating disease to diagnose and treat, but cats can have a great quality of life and live a long time with the appropriate treatment.

Here’s what you need to know about IBD in cats, from symptoms and causes to diagnosis and treatment.

What Causes IBD in Cats?

Though no single cause is known, more than one cause of IBD in cats is usually suspected. These include:


	
	Hypersensitivity to bacteria
	
	
	Food allergies that may include meat proteins, food additives, artificial coloring, preservatives, milk proteins, and gluten (wheat)
	
	
	Genetic factors
	


Symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Cats

Symptoms of IBD in cats usually are chronic and occur with increased frequency over time (daily, weekly, or monthly). Here are some symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease in cats:


	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Fatigue
	
	
	Chronic intermittent vomiting
	
	
	Gas (flatulence)
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Rumbling and gurgling abdominal sounds
	
	
	Bright red blood in the stool
	
	
	Distressed coat hair
	


How Do Vets Diagnose IBD in Cats?

Your veterinarian will take a detailed history and ask you questions about the duration and frequency of symptoms.

A complete physical examination will then be conducted, followed by routine laboratory tests, including:


	
	Complete blood count
	
	
	Biochemistry profile
	
	
	Urinalysis
	
	
	Fecal analysis
	


Although these tests do not definitively diagnose IBD in cats, they are noninvasive and help rule out other diseases (such as kidney disease, elevated thyroid levels, and liver disease) where the symptoms can be identical to IBD.

The results of these routine laboratory tests are often normal. In some patients, anemia and an abnormally high number of white blood cells (as in infections) may be present. In cats with IBD, abnormal levels of proteins and liver enzymes may also be found. Your veterinarian may also conduct tests to check the functioning of your cat’s small intestine.

Abdominal Ultrasound

An abdominal ultrasound is likely to be recommended to rule out other diseases not found in blood work (such as pancreatitis or cancer). It can also help vets assess the stomach and intestinal wall thickness, which can be significantly thicker in cats with IBD.

Stomach Biopsy

Your veterinarian may recommend biopsies of your cat’s stomach and intestines. This can be done with surgery or with endoscopy. Biopsies are the only way to definitively diagnose IBD and determine the extent of the disease.

Once a diagnosis is made, a tailored treatment plan will be created for your pet.

Treatment and Prognosis for IBD in Cats

In most cats, IBD cannot be “cured” but can be successfully managed. However, even after complete recovery, relapses are common.

Major goals of treatment are:


	
	Stabilizing your cat’s weight
	
	
	Relieving GI symptoms
	
	
	Reducing the immune system's response
	


Diet trials, immunosuppressive drugs, and antibiotics are key components of the therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in cats. Additionally, cobalamin is given in some cats to counteract deficiency of this nutrient.

Food Trials

Dietary management is another essential component of therapy, with hypoallergenic or novel protein diets being the most recommended. It usually takes two to four weeks or so to see if your cat responds to such a diet.

It is not uncommon to try several types of diets, so it could take several months to see if the diet is effective.

During the diet trial, only use the prescribed food. Avoid giving your cat treats, tuna, or anything flavored, including medications (talk to your vet about medications).

Keep a journal of the symptoms prior to and during a diet trial for your veterinarian to see if any difference is noted.

Antibiotics and Supplements

In some cases, a change in diet alone is not enough to treat your cat’s IBD, and medications are needed.

The most common medications used in the treatment of IBD are drugs that suppress the immune system, such as steroids. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics if your cat has diarrhea. In some cases, multiple medications may be necessary.

The goal of IBD treatment is to minimize the symptoms so your cat can have a great quality of life. Once that is reached, the medications will be tapered by your veterinarian to the lowest effective dose possible. In some cases, cats cannot be completely weaned off of medications and require lifelong medications.

What’s the Outlook for Cats With IBD?

The short-term prognosis in most cats with IBD is excellent. Be patient with the forms of treatment suggested by your veterinarian, and strictly adhere to their diet recommendations.

In most cases of IBD in cats, living a long and happy life is likely. The sooner the diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the better chances your cat has to recover.

In more severe cases, cats can have a difficult time responding to treatments, or could not respond at all, and the prognosis is poorer for these cats.

337,Inflammation of the Superficial Veins in Cats,"Phlebitis in Cats

Phlebitis is associated with a condition known as superficial thrombophlebitis -- an inflammation of veins close to the surface of the body, also known as the superficial veins. Phlebitis is generally due to an infection, or because of thrombosis -- the formation of a clot (or thrombus) inside a blood vessel, which in turn obstructs the flow of blood through the body.

Superficial venous thrombophlebitis is the most common form of this condition, and is usually localized in one area.

Deep tissue thrombophlebitis, conversely, is associated with clinical signs of sepsis, in which a bacterial infection occurs due to the presence of pathogenic organisms and their toxins in the blood or tissues. This type of thrombophlebitis is also associated with deep tissue thromboembolism, in which a clot or thrombus formed in one part of the body breaks free and migrates to another blood vessel, where it causes blockage.

Phlebitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

The main symptom of phlebitis is a localized inflammation, which can be seen due to warmth, swelling, pain, hardened vessels, or a redness of the skin known as erythema. If at least two of the aforementioned signs are present, this can be taken as a sign of local inflammation. Drainage or fever may also be present, both being associated with such infections.

Causes

There is no age, breed, or gender of cat that is known to be more susceptible to the development of phlebitis. However, very young or elderly cats may be at higher risk simply due to a less developed or poorly functioning immune system.

Characteristics that are considered risk factors for the development of phlebitis include obesity, lack of mobility, poor vein quality, chronic heart or kidney disease, pregnancy, and/or an immunodeficiency disorder in which the cat's immune system does not function properly.

The main cause of phlebitis is intravenous (IV) catheter use. Poor catheter quality or care may lead to bacterial colonization of a catheter, which can then infect the cat. Catheters are often used during surgery, or for the treatment of trauma victims.

Diagnosis

A number of diagnostic procedures are necessary for properly diagnosing phlebitis. The Doppler test is an inexpensive means for testing blood flow in the cat's veins, and may reveal any blood circulation irregularities and blockage. Blood cultures may also indicate signs associated with systematic inflammations. Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging and urine analysis.



Treatment

If infection is suspected, antibiotic treatment will be the most likely treatment. The specific antibiotic prescribed for your cat will depend on the location of the infection, as well as the suspected contaminants behind the infection (if no culture is available at the time). Additional medications may help to make your cat more comfortable by alleviating related symptoms.

Living and Management

After the initial treatment, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on the follow-up culture tests. Certain veins, known as phlebotic veins, should be avoided for IV therapy or blood collection until your cat has completely healed. With proper antibiotic treatment, the most severe cases may still take up to three weeks to resolve.

Prevention

Because the main cause of phlebitis is poor quality catheters or improper catheter care, this is the primary area to target when thinking about prevention. Any IV catheter sites should be cleaned regularly with antimicrobials and treated with antimicrobial ointment, in order to avoid bacterial infection that may lead to phlebitis. Sterile dressings should be used, and catheters should be changed within 24 hours, especially if they were placed in an emergency situation. Longer catheters may reduce the incidence of phlebitis."," and Types

338,Inflammation of the Middle Ear and External Ear Canal in Cats,"Otitis Externa and Otitis Media in Cats

Otitis externa is a chronic inflammation of a cat's external ear canal. Otitis media, meanwhile, is an inflammation of the cat's middle ear. Both of these terms are used to describe clinical symptoms and are not diseases in themselves.

Otitis externa often results when a change in the normal environment of the ear canal causes the glands lining the canal to enlarge and produce excessive wax. Gradually, the outer skin (epidermis) and the inner skin (dermis) produce excessive fibrous tissue (fibrosis) and the canal becomes narrowed. It is normally a secondary symptom of another underlying disease, such as an infection. Otitis externa causes pain, itching, and redness, and when the condition is chronic, it often results in a ruptured ear drum (tympanum) and otitis media.

Otitis media typically occurs as an extension of otitis externa, causing a ruptured membrane (tympanum) that separates the external ear and the middle ear.

The two conditions described in this medical article affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how they affect dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

The most common symptoms of otitis externa and otitis media are pain, head shaking, scratching at the external ear flaps, and bad odor. In a physical examination by a veterinarian, a cat with the condition may exhibit redness and swelling of the external ear canal, scaling skin or obstruction of the ear canal. Signs such as tilting the head, anorexia, uncoordination, and occasional vomiting may indicate the development of otitis media, or otitis interna, if the infection and inflammation spreads to the inner ear.

Causes

Otitis externa and otitis media can be caused by a variety of things. The primary causes are parasites, food allergies, drug reactions, foreign bodies (e.g., plant awns), accumulation of hair, dead skin buildup (keratinization), and autoimmune diseases.

Other factors that may contribute to the onset of the inflammatory conditions include bacterial infections, mixed infections caused by bacteria and fungal species, and progressive changes in the environment of the outer ear canal. Excessive moisture caused by swimming, or overzealous, abrasive, and improper ear cleaning may also lead to otitis externa and otitis media.

Diagnosis

These two conditions can be diagnosed in several ways. For instance, X-rays may be used to diagnose otitis media; an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to identify an accumulation of fluid or soft tissue growth in the middle ear.



Other ways of diagnosing these conditions include skin scrapings from the cat's ear flaps to test for parasites, and skin biopsies to check for autoimmune diseases. However, the single most important tool for diagnosing otitis externa and otitis media is a microscopic examination of the ear discharge (aural exudate).

Treatment

Treatment for otitis externa and otitis media usually involves outpatient care, unless the inflammation or infection has moved into the inner ear. In most cases of otitis externa, a topical therapy following a complete cleansing of the external ear is an effective resolution to the problem.

The topical therapy may consist of antibacterial, corticosteroid, anti-yeast, and antiseptic drops. In severe cases of otitis externa and otitis media -- where the presence of infectious organisms has been confirmed -- oral antibiotics and antifungals may be prescribed. Corticosteroids may also be used to reduce the cat's pain and swelling.

Living and Management

Follow-up treatments for otitis externa and otitis media involve repeat examinations of the ear discharge and control of any underlying diseases. You may be asked to routinely cleanse the cat’s ear to prevent a recurrence. With the proper therapy, most cases of otitis externa will resolve within three to four weeks, whereas otitis media takes a considerably longer amount of time to treat it, and up up to six weeks to be resolved.

If these conditions persist over long periods of time, and are not treated, they may lead to deafness, facial nerve paralysis, otitis interna, and (rarely) meningoencephalitis."," and Types

"
339,Inflammation of the Esophagus in Cats,"Esophagitis in Cats

Esophagitis is the term applied to inflammation of the esophagus -- the muscular tube that carries food down from the mouth cavity to the stomach. Gastrointestinal reflux, or acid reflux, is the most common cause of esophagitis in cats. Acid reflux is the result of stomach acids passing into the esophageal canal, causing irritation to the tissue lining of the esophagus.

Young cats born with congenital esophageal abnormalities are at an increased risk for esophagitis. Older cats that are being treated with anesthesia for surgery, or for other reasons, may also develop this condition. One of the most important complications of esophagitis is aspiration pneumonia, by which a cat that is not able to swallow food properly may end up with food material entering into the lungs.

Symptoms and Types


    Regurgitation (return of food or 	other contents from the esophagus or stomach back through the mouth)
    Increased swallowing motions
    Increased secretions coming out of 	mouth
    Pain while swallowing
    Difficulty in swallowing
    Cat may cry while swallowing food 	or after swallowing due to pain in the esophagus
    Cat may extends its head and neck 	during swallowing
    Inability to ingest food
    Reluctance to move or lie down
    Poor appetite
    Weight loss
    Coughing
    Fever
    Cat may feel pain if you touch its 	neck or esophagus
    More pronounced symptoms if 	pneumonia develops


Causes


    Reflux of gastric and/or 	intestinal contents (backward flow of fluids toward the esophagus)
    Accidental ingestion of irritant 	chemicals
    Infections
    After surgery involving the 	esophagus -- often due to passing of the feeding tube through the 	esophagus
    Chronic vomiting
    Foreign body remaining in 	esophagus
    Animal retaining ingested pills or 	capsules in esophagus


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will examine your cat thoroughly after taking a full history from you. You will need to give your veterinarian as much information as you can about your cat's health, including the onset of symptoms, and any possible incidents that might have preceded this condition.

Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and a urinalysis, though these tests usually return as normal in such patients. However, in cases of pneumonia, changes related to the infection may be seen in laboratory results. Radiographic studies, including X-ray or ultrasound imaging, may help in the diagnosis of esophagitis. An advanced type of radiography called barium contrast radiography may reveal changes in the esophagus due to inflammation. In barium contrast radiography, barium sulfate is administered orally to the cat. The particles are suspended in the esophagus, making the esophageal canal easier to visualize on X-ray.

Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis in these patients and is often a more reliable procedure for diagnosis of esophagitis. Endoscopy is an internal diagnostic tool which uses an endoscope, a rigid but flexible tube equipped with a camera and methods for retrieving tissue samples, that can be inserted into a hollow cavity, such as the esophagus.  Using this method, your veterinarian can look directly into the esophagus in order to visually inspect it, to take pictures, and to take a sample for biopsy.

Endoscopy may also be used to remove a foreign body, if required.

Treatment

If your cat is found to have a case of mild esophagitis it may be treated as an outpatient and will not likely need to be admitted into hospital. However, if your cat is suffering from complications like pneumonia, it will need to be admitted into hospital for intensive care and treatment. Fluids will be required for patients suffering from dehydration, and  oxygen will be supplemented until your cat's breathing has improved and it is out of danger. Antibiotics are often required to treat pneumonia in affected patients, but this is not always the case.

If gastrointestinal reflux is the cause of the esophagitis, your veterinarian will treat the cause and the symptoms to reduce their amount and frequency, and also to prevent the esophagus from narrowing in response to the stress and trauma.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian may recommend withholding water and food for a few days. While your cat is recovering, there are various methods for giving nutrition, including intravenous nutrition.

When your cat is able to ingest food again, a soft, palatable and highly nutritious food is recommended. Follow up progress checkups are an important part of after care, and endoscopy examinations are usually performed to verify that the esophagus is healing properly. The prognosis for affected animals is good if the esophagitis is recognized and treated promptly and aggressively. However, if the condition has progressed to the point that the esophagus has formed a stricture (narrowing), the prognosis is usually very poor."," and Types

340,Inflammation of Bone in Cats,"Panosteitis in Cats

Panosteitis refers to a painful condition that affects the cat's long leg bones and is characterized by limping and lameness.  It can occur with any breed, but it is more common in medium- to large-sized cat breeds and young cats around 5 to 18 months in age.

The inflammation can affect one or more of the cat's limbs, making it challenging and painful to move around. With treatment, the inflammation can be reduced and the cat can regain full function and activity.

Panosteitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Lameness is often characterized by trouble walking on the front legs, as there is often a deep pain associated with the bones. While the inflammation is more common in the front legs, it is also found in the back legs.

Some cats also exhibit fever, depression, weight loss, and anorexia. Additionally, if the condition is not corrected, some cats  may experience loss of muscle mass (atrophy) over time with the lack of muscle usage.

Causes

Overall, the causes of this condition are unknown. While lameness can affect any breed at any age, it is most common in younger breeds. The lameness may occur on its own or it may be accompanied with other orthopedic diseases.

Diagnosis

Joint pain can last from days to months, and will range from mild to severe. Your veterinarian will examine your cat to rule out underlying conditions other than inflammation of the bones. X-ray imaging and blood analysis will be used to search for any underlying conditions. In most cases, the inflammation will be the cause of the pain and can be reduced with drug treatment.

Treatment

In some cases, anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed and administered to help with the pain and to encourage walking. Steroids can also assist in the reduction of inflammation in the bones.

Limited activity will help to reduce your cat’s pain. Allowing your cat time to recover, and time for the joints and bones to heal, however, will not reduce the speed of recovery.

It is recommended that you take your cat to be re-checked every two to four weeks for progress, as well as to detect if there are any more serious underlying medical issues that have been causing the problems.

Living and Management

It is important to observe your pet and work to reduce their overall pain levels through reduction of activity, pain medication, and environment. The pain may last only a few days, or it could last for several months. In rarer cases, juvenile bone (orthopedic) disease can develop.

Prevention

There are currently no known preventive measures for this medical condition."," and Types

"
341,Inflamed Chewing Muscles and Eye Muscles in Cats,"Focal Inflammatory Myopathy in Cats

Myopathy is a general term that is used to denote any disorder of the muscles. Focal inflammatory myopathy is a localized form of the disease that affects specific  muscle groups, in this case the masticatory (chewing) muscles and extraocular (eye) muscles.

The masticatory muscles are a group of four facial muscles that are used for chewing, and the extraocular muscles are a group of muscles, adjacent to eyeball, that control the movements of the eyes.

Focal inflammatory myopathy is suspected to be due to autoantibodies, or antibodies that are known to react against the body's own tissues. Antibodies are proteins found in the blood and which are used by the immune system to identify and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. In effect, the antibody has crossed signals, mistakenly attacking the body as though reacting to a pathogen.

Focal inflammatory myopathy describes a condition in which these autoantibodies begin targeting the muscles of the affected animal. This disease is relatively rare in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Masticatory muscles

    Problems with normal jaw movements
    Inability to get and keep food in the mouth
    Jaw pain
    Muscle swelling around jaw and face
    Progressive loss of muscle mass


Extraocular muscles

    Swelling around eye
    Protrusion of the eyeball from the 	eye socket


Causes

Immune-mediated

Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your cat.

Your veterinarian may attempt to manipulate your cat's jaw muscles to induce pain and swelling of the muscles so that the source of the problem is more evident. Your veterinarian will also try to open your cat's mouth, which often proves unsuccessful in these patients. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.

The biochemistry profile may indicate higher levels of serum creatine kinase, indicating muscle injury. More specific testing includes taking a muscle tissue sample, especially important in masticatory diseases. This test can help in reaching a confirmatory diagnosis. More advanced testing may include demonstrating the autoantibodies against the muscle fibers. Diagnostic imaging will include X-ray of the jaw bones and ultrasound of the eye orbit to examine the swollen extraocular muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be used to examine the muscle inflammation.



Treatment

As focal inflammatory myopathy is an immune-mediated disease, immune-suppressive drugs will be used to suppress the cat's immune system in order to limit the abnormal immune response. The dose is adjusted and maintained at lower doses to prevent restricted jaw mobility. In most patients long-term treatment will cover a minimum of six months before there is a resolution of symptoms.

Living and Management

Abnormal jaw movements remain a major problem because it limits the cat's ability to take food into its mouth. If the disease becomes chronic, the muscle bulk of the jaws and face may reduce considerably, further complicating the jaw's movements. In severe cases, stomach tubes may be required in order to feed your cat a liquid or gruel diet to maintain health. Your veterinarian will brief you about the proper care and use of the stomach tube, including how to clean before and after use. This is essential, as improperly cleaned, contaminated medical aids can cause severe infection.

Long-term use of immune-suppressive drugs are harmful for the patient's overall health. It is important to strictly follow the dosage and frequency of the medication in order to avoid complications related to their use. Never modify the dosage of the immune-suppressive drugs or stop the treatment without prior consulting with the veterinarian. If you have any concerns you should consult with your veterinarian first. You will also need to isolate your cat to some degree while it is under treatment to protect it from outside illnesses, and from transmissible illnesses from other animals or pets.

Most patients respond well to the immune-suppressive drugs and jaw mobility will return to normal. However, in chronic cases, the prognosis is often not good due to the loss of muscle bulk. Timely treatment is the single most important factor in the treatment of cats with focal inflammatory myopathy."," and Types

342,Infertility in Female Cats,"Inability to Reproduce in Cats

Normal fertility in a cat, and the ability to reproduce kittens, requires a normal estrous cycle, with a healthy reproductive tract, normal ova (eggs), normal and stable levels of reproductive hormones, fertilization by normal spermatozoa, implantation of an embryo in the lining of the uterus (endometrium), normal placenta placement, and stable levels of progesterone concentration. These conditions must be maintained for the entirety of the two month gestational period, or the process of reproduction will be altered, with resultant infertility.

Symptoms

Some of the common symptoms that appear in cats that are unable to  reproduce are abnormal cycling, failure to conceive, failure to  copulate/mate, normal copulation without subsequent pregnancy, and/or pregnancy loss.

Causes

Infertility can affect cats of all ages, but tends to be more common among older cats. Cats that have had previous uterine infections can also have subsequent difficulties with implantation. However, one of the most causes of seeming infertility is insemination during the improper time in the estrous cycle.

Other conditions that may play a role in the cat's ability to reproduce include:


    Male infertility factors
    Sub-clinical uterine infections
    Toxoplasmosis/protozoal infection
    Hypercortisolism
    Abnormal ovarian functions
    Chromosomal abnormality
    Systemic viral or protozoal infection
    Lack of sufficient copulatory stimulus in order to induce ovulation


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. There are several diagnostic tests that can be conducted in order to find out if the symptoms are related to the infertility disorder.

Some of the basis for the diagnosis will be related to whether your cat has conceived or given birth in the past. If she has reproduced successfully before, your veterinarian will consider whether the male mate that has been chosen for breeding is of proven fertility, or whether the timing for the breeding was scheduled in accordance with your cat's ovulation cycle.  

Your cat's hormone levels will be analyzed, to be sure that she has the required levels for conception and a following pregnancy. Progesterone concentration must remain steady throughout the pregnancy for it to be successful.



A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests will show evidence of infections, either bacterial, viral, or parasitic. Viral infections that will be tested for include toxoplasmosis, protozoal parasite infection, herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and hypercorticolism. In addition, your doctor will be checking your cat's body thoroughly for any other chronic disease conditions.

Imaging techniques may be used to look for any abnormalities in the uterus, such as masses (indicating tumors), and anatomic abnormalities that would interfere with conception. In a healthy cat, the ovaries and uterus will not be visible on X-ray imaging. If your veterinarian is able to view the ovaries or uterus, this would suggest that there may be an underlying condition of ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine cysts. If it appears, on examination, that your cat has cysts or other masses of tissue in the uterus or reproductive tract, your veterinarian will need to take a sample of tissue from the uterus for biopsy.

Treatment

Improper breeding is most often at the root of the perceived  infertility. To prevent this, the male tom cat may be bred to another queen to test his ability to impregnate. Your doctor may also advise you to change the amount of light your cat  receives, including natural or artificial light, since cats' estrous  cycles are heavily influenced by season light changes. Another alternative may be the use of  gonadotropin, a hormone which induces ovulation in animals unable to do  so normally.

If improper breeding does not seem at fault, your veterinarian will  begin treatment for other underlying causes for infertility. For  example, antibiotics are given if a uterine infection is suspected. Some of the surgical considerations include surgical repair of the obstructed reproductive tract, surgical correction of abnormalities in the vagina, removal of a cancerous ovary, and either draining or surgically removing the ovarian cysts.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up exam to test your cat's progesterone hormone levels, and to perform an ultrasonography exam to confirm a healthy pregnancy and placental position.","

343,Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats,"What Is Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats?
Infectious arthritis in cats is a type of arthritis caused by bacteria (or some other infectious agent) entering the joints, which results in painful inflammation. This is different from noninfectious arthritis, which, for example, can be caused by the erosion of cartilage between joints (osteoarthritis) or by an autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis).

Infectious arthritis in cats most commonly affects the wrist (carpus), ankle (hock), knee, and the hip joints. It is often due to an infection that spread from another part of the body. When an infectious agent enters a joint, it damages both the bone and the cartilage and can also affect other structures in the area, namely ligaments, tendons, and muscle.

While infectious arthritis is common in dogs, it is rare in cats. It can affect a single joint or multiple joints (called polyarthritis). In general, this condition is not contagious among pets nor can it be shared with people.

This type of arthritis is not an immediately life-threatening emergency, but your cat should be examined by her veterinarian as soon as possible if any signs develop, such as limping. The chances for recovery increase the faster treatment can begin.

Symptoms of Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats
The main signs of infectious arthritis include heat, swelling, and pain in one or more joints. Signs can present either as an acute (rapid) or chronic (gradual) process. In addition, septic arthritis can cause:


	
	Decreased range of motion
	
	
	Limping, lameness
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Stiff gait
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Decreased or lack of appetite
	


Causes of Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats
Any trauma that punctures a joint, such as a wounds or even a surgical procedure done on a joint, can result in infectious arthritis. The regular non-infectious arthritic process, osteoarthritis, and even joint injections to treat it can cause infectious arthritis.

Infection occurs when foreign material, such as viruses, bacteria, and funguses, enter the joint space. Some causes include:


	
	Feline calicivirus and fungal organisms
	
	
	Cats with compromised immune systems, or those taking immune-suppressing medications
	
	
	Chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus
	
	
	Blood-borne infections, which can travel from the blood and infect the joint
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats
If your vet suspects your cat has infectious arthritis, they will perform a complete physical exam, take a thorough history, including asking about past injuries and illnesses that could have initiated the arthritis.

They will take a blood sample to look for evidence of infection and/or inflammation. In early cases, the vet may see an increased amount of joint fluid on an x-ray of the affected limb as an indication of a current infection.

X-rays are also helpful in chronic or long-term cases to reveal signs of degenerative joint disease (DJD), such as changes to the bones or irregular joint spaces. An arthrocentesis, or sampling of the joint fluid, will also be performed to look for infection and inflammatory cells. The fluid will be cultured to determine what infectious agent (bacteria, virus, or fungus) is present. The fluid culture will also be used to determine the best medications to treat the specific infection. Serologic blood testing (which checks for antibodies in the blood) can be done to look for evidence of tick-borne disease.

Treatment of Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats
If your cat has been diagnosed with infectious arthritis, your vet will recommend hospitalizing your cat. She will be treated with IV antibiotics and injectable pain medications until comfortable and stable enough to continue to be treated at home. IV fluids and other supportive care will be provided to help reduce fever and stimulate appetite.

In some cases, it is possible that your vet might want to lavage the affected joint. This procedure will flush the joint with a sterile solution to help minimize joint damage. In severe cases, the patient will require surgery to open the joint, remove any abnormal tissue, and lavage the area to facilitate the healing process.

Recovery and Management of Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats
If your cat’s condition is diagnosed within 24-48 hours, her response to antibiotic therapy should result in a good recovery. Once your cat is home after the diagnosis and stabilization, your vet will usually recommend long-term management, such as icing and rest.

Icing the joint helps increase blood flow and decrease inflammation. Your vet will recommend that you restrict your cat’s activity to avoid putting pressure on the healing joint. This can be accomplished by keeping your cat in a small room (or even a large crate) where she cannot jump. Your cat should still have enough room to move around, eat and drink, and have a litter box to go to the bathroom.

Use a shallow litter pan so your cat does not have to exert herself to use it.

Medications will likely be prescribed for 4-8 weeks and include antibiotics and pain medication. Monitor your cat’s joints for heat, swelling, and pain, as bacterial or fungal agents can come back since your cat is now predisposed to the condition. This is important because the quicker the diagnosis, the better the chance of recovery.

344,Increased Heart Rate Due to Premature Contractions in Cats,"Ventricular Tachycardia in Cats


Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening disease of the heart that causes arrhythmia, an abnormally fast heartbeat. This may be due to an underlying heart disease, a metabolic disease, or an electrolyte imbalance. Ventricular tachycardia can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the ventricles (the bottom two heart chambers) become disorganized, contracting chaotically. This state can result in asystole – a sudden lack of electrical activity in the heart – and sudden death.
 
Ventricular tachycardia may occur in structurally normal hearts, as hereditary arrhythmias, or may be a consequence of myocardial abnormalities associated with cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), significant valvular disease, or myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation). To date, there is no medical therapy available that is known to prevent sudden death in cats afflicted with ventricular tachycardia arrhythmias.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Fainting (syncope)
    Weakness 
    Exercise intolerance 
    Sudden death 
    May be without symptoms 
    Increased heart rate 
    Signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) 

 
Causes
 

    Cardiomyopathy (left ventricle heart disease)
    Congenital defects (especially subaortic stenosis – narrowing of the aortic passage) 
    Chronic valve disease
    Digitalis toxicity (heart medication)
    Hyperthyroidism - overactive thyroid gland
    Cancer of the heart 
    Myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle 
    Pancreatitis - inflammation of the pancreas

 
Diagnosis
 
If your cat is unstable, your doctor will apply treatment based on the symptoms before diagnosing the cause of the ventricular tachycardia. (See the treatment section below.)  If your cat is stable, your veterinarian will begin with a complete physical exam of your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The electrolyte panel will show if there is hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The bloodwork may show evidence of pancreatitis and hyperthyroidism. 
 
An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), and an echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging for the heart) will be performed to check for structural heart disease. A long-term ambulatory (portable) electrocardiograph recording of the heart's electrical activity, using a Holter monitor, can be used for detecting temporary ventricular arrhythmias in patients with unexplained syncope or weakness. The Holter can be especially useful for animals, since it can be worn as a vest, allowing the animal freedom of normal movement, which, when taken into account with a diary kept (by the pet caretaker) while the monitor is being worn, can give your veterinarian a reference frame for when the heartbeat irregularities are most likely to occur. 


 


Treatment
 
If your cat is stable, electrolyte abnormalities will be corrected using fluid administration. Echocardiogram and use a 24-Holter to establish a true baseline of the arrhythmia quantity and quality.
 
If the cat is unstable (inactive and lying down, weak, or frequent fainting), immediate intravenous treatment in a hospital setting with continuous ECG monitoring may be required. Once the arrhythmia is controlled and your cat's blood pressure has stabilized, oral medication should be started. The medication will be based on your cat's overall health, and how well your cat is able to tolerate the episodes of VT and how frequently they occur. Medications may be given to suppress future episodes. A follow-up 24-hour Holter will be required to test the efficacy of the anti-arrhythmic medication. 
 
Living and Management
 
Unfortunately, cats with ventricular tachycardia can sometimes die suddenly. Your veterinarian will schedule subsequent follow-up appointments with you for your cat as necessary to try to avoid this possibility."," and Types

345,Incoordination of the Legs in Cats,"Hypermetria and Dysmetria in Cats
 
Dysmetria and hypermetria describe the incoordination of an animal's limbs during voluntary movement. More specifically, dysmetria is characterized by a cat's inability to judge the rate, range, and force of its movements -- literally, an inability to measure space. Hypermetria, meanwhile, describes the action of overreaching, or high stepping, the intended location.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Signs of cerebellar disease that may be present include:


    Head tilt
    Body swaying
    Body tremors; often more pronounced with movement
    Wide leg stance
    Loss of the menace response – the reflexive closing of the eyes when a finger is stabbed toward the eye
    Unequal pupil size (anisocoria)
    Abnormal, jerky movements

  
Causes
 
Trauma to the brain or back is often the primary cause for spinal or brain injury, leading to incoordination or overreaching of the  limbs. Lesions on the cerebellum, the part of the brain that is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements and balance, or on the nerves leading to the cerebellum, are believed to be one of the causes for these symptoms. Lesions can be caused by strokes, or by tumors located near these nerves.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. If there are no other signs of cerebellar disease, it will be important to establish whether a high-stepping thoracic limb gait is physically normal for your cat. Diagnostic imaging, such as with X-ray or ultrasound, is generally performed to review possible injury or damage to the brain and spine, and is especially recommended for older animals.


 
Your veterinarian will check your cat's reactions and responses to stimulus, such as whether your cat responds when your veterinarian stabs a finger toward the its eyes. The reflexive closing of the eyes and jerking away is called the menace response, or menace reflex, and the lack of such of a response is indicative of loss of eye sight, or neurological dysfunction.
 
Treatment
 
If the condition is severe and/or rapidly progressive, hospitalization is recommended for an immediate diagnostic work-up and treatment. If the condition is mild or slowly progressive, treatment is often done on an outpatient basis. Generally, cats that are suffering from this condition are confined to ensure that they are not at risk of being injured while they are healing. You will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally. You may consider cage rest for a short time, if it is difficult to keep your cat confined to one place.

However, it is important that your cat is not left alone for extended times, as this can be a very stressful time for the cat, and being alone for too long can make the stress, and the healing, worse for the cat.   
 
Living and Management
 
It is recommended that periodic neurologic examinations be performed to monitor your cat's progress."," and Types

346,Inability to Urinate in Cats,"Functional Urinary Retention in Cats



Urinary retention is the medical term given to incomplete emptying (or voiding) of urine not associated with the obstruction of the lower urinary tract, whereas ""functional"" is defined as being caused by a problem with the normal action of an organ.



Complications resulting from functional urinary retention may come from a lower urinary tract infection that ascends into the bladder; rupture of the urinary bladder or urethra; and permanent injury and atony (weakness/loss of coordination) to the detrusor muscle, the muscular layer of the urinary bladder wall, which contracts, pushes down on the contents of the bladder, and causes the urine to leave the body through the urethra.



This condition is more common in male than in female cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Palpably distended urinary bladder
	Ineffective, frequent, attempts to urinate without success
	Urine stream may be weak, attenuated, or interrupted
	Bladder may be so full that it frequently leaks urine
	Abdominal distension, abdominal pain, or signs of postrenal azotemia may predominate in rare cases or with urinary tract rupture
	Recurrent urinary tract infections may have caused muscular problems associated with urinating


 

Causes



Hypercontractility of the Urinary Bladder Detrusor Muscle (Detrusor Atony)




	Most commonly develops after sudden (acute) or long-term (chronic) urinary bladder overdistension; many cats have a history of nervous system dysfunction or previous urinary blockage or obstruction
	Electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia
	Lesions of the pelvic nerves
	Lesions of the sacral spinal cord (such as congenital malformations, cauda equina compression, lumbosacral disk disease, and vertebral fractures/dislocations) can result in a flaccid, overdistended urinary bladder with weak outlet resistance (outlet resistance is inhibition of the ability to pass urine through the urethra)
	Lesions of the suprasacral spinal cord (such as intervertebral disk protrusion, spinal fractures, and compressive tumors) can result in a distended, firm urinary bladder that is difficult to express or empty by gentle manual pressure
	Cats with neuropathy, sacral lesions, suprasacral spinal lesions, or midbrain disorders may also suffer from detrusor-urethral dyssynergia, where the contraction of the detrusor muscle and the relaxation of the urethra are not coordinated
	Decreased contraction of the detrusor muscle (detrusor atony) with urine retention is a feature of a disorder characterized by abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system (known as dysautonomia); dysautonomia is encountered primarily in cats in Great Britain


 

Functional Urinary Obstruction




	Previous pelvic or urethral surgery
	Anticholinergic medications (which may affect normal nerve actions)
	Excessive urethral resistance, usually attributed to smooth or striated muscular components of the urethra (urethrospasm); may be seen after urethral obstruction or urethral or pelvic surgery, urethral inflammation, or prostatic disease




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The urinalysis may reveal evidence of urinary tract infection or inflammation.



A neurologic examination will include a brief assessment of the lower, caudal spine. Peripheral nerve function will be apparent from the examination of anal tone, tail tone, and perineal reflexes (the muscle between the anal and urethral openings). l catheterization may be required to rule out urethral obstruction. If there is no obstruction the catheter should pass easily through the urethra.



Myelography, epidurography, or computed tomography (CT scans) can be used to determine if lesions are present on the spine, indicating a neurological cause. Another imaging technique veterinarians use involves injecting a radiocontrasting agent into the cat's body to follow the course of the urine from the kidneys through the urethral tract by X-ray.



Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis to settle on the underlying cause. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.



Here are some of the possible causes that will be considered and either discounted or confirmed:




	Extramural urethral compression, such as smooth bladder neck mass, a large prostate gland, or a caudal abdominal mass
	Oliguria, anuria, and urinary tract rupture
	Physical and mechanical obstruction; clinical signs of urinary obstruction include pollakiuria, stranguria, and hematuria; patients with mechanical obstruction may void a few drops of urine after long periods of straining
	Lesions above the spine or on the sacrum (the posterior base of the spine) that can affect signals from the brain and consequently the impulse to urinate; may also be indicated by partial or complete paralysis of limbs, hyperreflexia of limbs, and cervical, thoracolumbar, and lumbar pain; depressed tail tone;
	The urinary bladder is usually distended, firm, and difficult to express with lesions of the upper spine, and is typically distended, flaccid, and fairly easy to express with sacral lesions; in patients with chronic or partial lesions, reflexive voiding may return
	Loss of muscle coordination in the detrusor muscle
	In patients recovering from urinary obstruction, inability to void may result from re-obstruction, excessive urethral resistance (functional obstruction), or detrusor weakness (atony) caused by overdistension; if the urinary bladder can be expressed via gentle manual compression applied on the abdomen, detrusor atony is likely; if resistance to manual expression is encountered and urethral obstruction can be ruled out by examination or catheterization, functional obstruction is likely






Treatment



Unless there is a severe underlying condition that is causing this urinary disorder, your cat will most likely be treated on an inpatients basis until adequate urinary function returns. Urinary tract infection, if present, will be identified specifically and treat appropriately. Your veterinarian will address primary disorders such as electrolyte disturbances and neurologic lesions and correct them if possible. Azotemia, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances associated with acute urine retention will be managed appropriately. Your doctor will also manage excess levels of urea and other nitrogenous waste products in the blood (uremia or azotemia), electrolyte imbalances, and acid–base disturbances associated with sudden (acute) urine retention



Surgical options may be considered for salvaging the opening of the urethra in some cats; surgical removal of the penis and creation of a new opening in the urethra (known as perineal urethrostomy) may be required in male cats with unmanageable urethral resistance (inhibition of the ability to pass urine through the urethra) in the end of the urethra.



In some cases, complete voiding function does not return, in which case lifetime management of your cat's urinary health will be required on your part. Frequent manual compression will be needed for release of urine, and intermittent or indwelling urinary catheterization may be required to ensure urine flow and to keep the urinary bladder small.



Your veterinarian will perform periodic urinalysis to detect recurrent urinary tract infection if your cat has been diagnosed with chronic urine retention."," and Types

347,Inability to Protrude or Retract Penis in Cats,"Paraphimosis and Phimosis in Cats

Paraphimosis is a condition that causes the cat to be unable to retract its penis back into the sheath. Phimosis, on the other hand, refers to the cat's inability to protrude its penis from its outer orifice.

Both of these medical conditions can occur in male dogs and cats at any age. If you would like to learn more about how paraphimosis and phimosis affect dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The cat's inability to protrude its penis may go unnoticed until it tries to copulate with a female. Also, if the cat is having trouble urinating, it may be a sign of this medical disorder. If the animal experiences problems retracting its penis into the sheath, you may notice it licking the exterior of its penis. If it occurs over a prolonged period, there could also be fluid accumulation in the tissues (edema) or swelling in the area.
 
Causes
 
The inability to retract the penis (paraphimosis) often occurs when the cat has a small opening (orifice), and in many cases is a birth defect. If the cat is unable to protrude the penis (phimosis), it may have swelling, or hairs that are obstructing the penis. In some cases, injury or a neurological disease can cause this medical condition.
 
Diagnosis
 
With paraphimosis, the veterinarian will be able to view the exposed penis and/or gland areas upon examination. The goal is to identify the underlying medical cause for the condition for treatment options.
 
 
 
Treatment
 
In some instances surgery can help enlarge the opening of the sheath (orifice), making it possible for the penis to protrude. Also, veterinarians can remove tissue surrounding the penile area to allow for a normal, functioning penis.
 
Immediate treatment is necessary for cat that are unable to retract its penis into the sheath, as damage to the tissues can occur. Techniques to repair or aid in this medical condition can include removing any foreign objects that are present, lubricating the penile area for retraction, surgical enhancement of the orifice area if it is too small, and catheters if the cat is unable to urinate. At times, ointments and topical medications are prescribed to correct phimosis.
 
Living and Management
 
With treatment, both conditions have a positive prognosis. However, cats that are unable to retract their penis into the shaft need immediate medical attention, as there are several complications that can occur if the penis is left outside of the body for extended periods of time.
 
Prevention
 
There are currently no known preventative methods for either medical condition."," and Types

348,Hypothyroidism in Cats,"What Is Hypothyroidism in Cats?
Hypothyroidism in cats is a lack of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism in cats is rare and can be divided into two categories: congenital (present at birth) and acquired.

The most common scenario is when a cat that has hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) has treatment that overcorrects and then causes them to have (acquired) hypothyroidism.

Congenital Hypothyroidism

Congenital hypothyroidism is a rare form that is present in kittens at birth. The thyroid hormone is important for the development of the nervous and skeletal systems. Kittens that lack this hormone will have related symptoms, such as mental dullness and smaller than normal proportions.

Acquired Hypothyroidism

Acquired hypothyroidism in cats is a lack of thyroid hormone in adult cats, which is also very rare. Acquired hypothyroidism can further be divided into three categories: primary hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism, and iatrogenic hypothyroidism. Each type has a different cause.

Primary hypothyroidism is thought to result from either an immune-mediated disorder that destroys thyroid tissue, such as lymphocytic thyroiditis, or from thyroid gland atrophy, a shrunken and shriveled gland that does not function properly.

Secondary hypothyroidism has only been reported in one cat that suffered head trauma, which caused a decrease in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland.

Iatrogenic hypothyroidism can often occur in cats that are being treated for hyperthyroidism, which is the overproduction of thyroid hormone.

Surgery or radioactive iodine therapy to regulate overactive hormone production can sometimes leave cats with the opposite problem: their levels of thyroid hormone are now too low. This will cause irreversible hypothyroidism in your cat, but it can be managed.

Your cat can also have iatrogenic hypothyroidism if you are treating them with methimazole (in a pill or transdermal gel) as the veterinarian tries to find the right dose for your cat. However, this is reversible over several months after finding the right dose.

Symptoms of Hypothyroidism in Cats	
The symptoms you’ll see depend on the type of hypothyroidism your cat has.

Congenital Hypothyroidism

Kittens with congenital hypothyroidism can display the following symptoms:


	
	Mental dullness
	
	
	Small size compared to their littermates
	
	
	Abnormal body proportions, such as a large and wide head, enlarged tongue, and short limbs
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Wobbly, drunken gait (also known as ataxia)
	
	
	Dry skin
	
	
	Thin fur
	


Acquired Hypothyroidism

Cats with acquired hypothyroidism may display the following signs:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Excessive weight gain
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	
	
	Dry, dull coat
	
	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Scaly skin
	


Causes of Hypothyroidism in Cats
The causes of hypothyroidism in cats are also dependent on the type.

Congenital Hypothyroidism

Causes of congenital hypothyroidism can be divided into goitrous and nongoitrous forms. Goitrous refers to the enlargement of the thyroid gland.

Goitrous congenital hypothyroidism is thought to be caused by an inherited defect or dietary issues with iodine in the pregnant mother cat or newborn kitten.

Nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism is usually caused by incomplete thyroid organ development. Congenital feline hypothyroidism has been seen in domestic shorthair cats as well as Abyssinian cats.

Acquired Hypothyroidism

Adult-onset acquired hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by iatrogenic hypothyroidism. This condition occurs when a cat’s treatment for hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) results in an underactive thyroid.

Finding the balance an individual cat needs and anticipating their body’s response to therapy can be challenging. 

How Vets Diagnose Hypothyroidism in Cats
Diagnosis of hypothyroidism in cats requires blood samples to be drawn and put through a specific test called a thyroid panel. A feline thyroid panel consists of multiple measurements.

In a cat with hypothyroidism, their total T4 measurement is usually low. However, certain medications as well as a syndrome called euthyroid sick could also be responsible for lowering your cat’s total T4, so additional testing may be required.

This additional testing may consist of a blood sample for measuring free T4 (not bonded to your cat’s blood protein, which means the T4 is able to penetrate body tissues), T3, and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone).

In kittens with congenital hypothyroidism, X-rays may reveal bony changes. The thyroid hormone is essential for normal development of a kitten’s skeletal and nervous systems, so a lack of the hormone leads to changes seen in these systems.

Your veterinarian may also see high cholesterol and anemia on a complete blood count and chemistry panel.  While these issues are not unique to a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, seeing them in your cat may lead your vet to order more specific tests, including thyroid measurements. 

Treatment for Hypothyroidism in Cats
Treatment for hypothyroidism in cats is aimed at restoring normal blood levels of thyroid hormone. This is typically managed by giving an oral thyroid medication supplement, in either liquid or tablet form.

The drug sodium levothyroxine is usually given twice daily. Some cats may also require a second medication, called synthetic sodium liothyronine (L-T3).

Cats with congenital and acquired hypothyroidism (primary, secondary, and iatrogenic from surgery or radioactive iodine) will have to be on medication forever. But cats with acquired iatrogenic hypothyroidism from too high of a dose of oral or transdermal methimazole can usually be treated by adjusting the dose.

Recovery and Management of Hypothyroidism in Cats
The goal of oral medication for hypothyroidism in cats is to improve the clinical signs of the disease. Follow-up bloodwork is important to assess the absorption and appropriate dosing of medication.

An overdose of medication can have significant consequences, so your cat’s blood levels of T4 are an important indicator of appropriate regulation.

In cats with acquired iatrogenic hypothyroidism after treatment for hyperthyroidism, additional follow-up testing—including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis—is recommended.

With some of these cats (that were given oral or transdermal medication for hyperthyroidism), hypothyroidism can be reversed when your vet finds the ideal dosage of long-term hyperthyroid medication for your cat.

Cats that were treated for hyperthyroidism with permanent treatments like surgery or radioactive iodine that led to hypothyroidism will need the long-term oral thyroid hormone.
Hypothyroidism in Cats FAQsIs hypothyroidism fatal in cats?Acquired hypothyroidism, which affects adult cats, is rarely fatal. However, hypothyroidism can lower the kidney glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of how well your cat’s kidneys are working to filter waste.

If a cat has chronic renal (kidney) disease in addition to hypothyroidism, the combined effect of these factors can lead to severe azotemia or renal failure, which is fatal in cats. 

Congenital hypothyroidism, which is present at birth, can be fatal in kittens.
How long can cats live with hypothyroidism? Kittens with congenital hypothyroidism have an unknown prognosis. As this is a rare disease for cats, not much research exists for survival rates. Individual kitten survival depends on the severity of changes in their skeleton and nervous system.

Adult cats with acquired hypothyroidism have a good prognosis with management of their disease and can achieve a nearly normal life expectancy.
Is hypothyroidism in cats painful?The side effects of untreated hypothyroidism can be painful.  

In kittens with congenital hypothyroidism, pain and discomfort can arise from the lameness associated with the illness.

Discomfort for adult cats with untreated acquired hypothyroidism can arise from the following:  


	
	Inflammation from excessive weight gain or abnormal skin barriers
	
	
	Dehydration from lowered kidney function or chronic renal disease
	
	
	Buildup of toxins in the bloodstream
	
	
	Nausea
	
	
	Weakness and a general feeling of being unwell
	

What do you feed a cat with hypothyroidism?Cats with hypothyroidism should be fed a high-quality diet as recommended by their veterinarian.

Some hypothyroid kittens require a growth formula to help them gain weight, while some hypothyroid adult cats may require a weight-management formula to help them lose weight.

349,Hypothermia in Cats,"What Is Hypothermia in Cats?
Cats run a little hotter than we do, with a normal body temperature of 100 degrees F to 102.5 degrees F. Hypothermia in cats is when their body temperature falls below normal, or under 100 degrees F.

With mild hypothermia, a cat’s blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate initially increase. However, as hypothermia progresses, all three decreases. Lack of adequate blood flow and oxygen can lead to heart arrhythmias and, in severe cases, death.

You may not readily notice mild hypothermia. If your cat is shivering, it means their body is actively working to combat hypothermia.

However, if your cat is cold to the touch and acting excessively tired, or if your cat isn’t responsive, this is an emergency. Take your cat to the nearest emergency veterinarian.

Hypothermia is more common in kittens, senior cats, and cats who go outdoors. A cat of any breed can develop hypothermia, though healthy cats usually don’t develop this condition.

Symptoms of Hypothermia in Cats
You may have an image in your mind of what a person with hypothermia looks like. Well, some of the same symptoms occur in cats.

Symptoms of hypothermia in cats include:


	
	Shivering
	
	
	Weakness or lethargy
	
	
	Collapse or coma
	
	
	Being cold to the touch
	
	
	Fast breathing with mild hypothermia and slow breathing with severe hypothermia
	
	
	Low blood pressure (detected by a veterinarian)
	
	
	Abnormal heart rhythms (detected by a veterinarian)
	


Causes of Hypothermia in Cats
There are several circumstances that can lead to hypothermia in cats, including:


	
	Exposure to freezing temperatures, especially wet and windy conditions
	
	
	Recovering from or undergoing an anesthetic procedure
	
	
	Medical conditions like heart disease, kidney disease, or sepsis
	
	
	Head trauma
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypothermia in Cats
To diagnose hypothermia in cats, your veterinarian will simply take your cat’s temperature. Insertion of the thermometer into the rectum is the preferred method.

Providing your veterinarian with your cat’s recent activities and relevant medical history is crucial for making an appropriate diagnosis of the cause of the hypothermia. You can help your veterinarian by sharing any of the following information:


	
	Has your cat been outside recently?
	
	
	Was your cat bathed recently?
	
	
	Does your cat have any known medical conditions, particularly heart disease, kidney disease, or a recent infection?
	


The veterinarian will run several lab tests to monitor your cat’s overall health. They will want to rule out anemia and make sure your cat’s blood sugar level is normal. They may also perform an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a test that allows your vet to look at your cat’s heart rhythm.

If there is concern about other medical conditions like heart disease, additional tests such as an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) may be recommended.

Treatment of Hypothermia in Cats
The primary goal of treating hypothermia is to get your cat’s body temperature back to normal.

Several methods exist for rewarming your cat. External rewarming includes wrapping your cat in blankets, applying warm water bags, and using heating pads or other warming devices like Bair Huggers™. Warming devices should always be separated from the cat by towels or blankets to prevent burns.

In severe cases, internal rewarming may be performed. This involves putting warmed fluid into a cat’s stomach, rectum, or abdomen. IV fluids will also be warmed prior to administration. Internal rewarming should only be performed by veterinary staff. Cats with hypothermia due to severe heart disease may not be given IV fluids because it could overload their heart.

Abnormal heart rhythms in hypothermic cats don’t generally respond well to the medications that veterinarians would otherwise use to treat them. These arrhythmias generally improve on their own as body temperature increases. The veterinarian will keep an ECG on a cat to monitor their heart rhythm during recovery.

Unconscious patients may need to have a tube placed in their trachea to help them breathe and to prevent aspiration if they vomit. Supplemental oxygen can be administered through this endotracheal tube.

Recovery and Management of Hypothermia in Cats
Cats who are going to recover will usually return to their normal body temperature within several hours. In moderate to severe cases, your veterinarian may want to keep your cat in the hospital for a day or two to monitor their recovery.

If your cat has an underlying health condition like heart disease contributing to their hypothermia, lifelong management will be necessary. Your veterinarian will work with you to develop the best management plan for your pet.

In some severe cases, the damage is too severe and the cat will not recover. Cats who have hypothermia due to exposure to freezing temperatures should also be checked for frostbite.

Heated beds may help keep your cat comfortable at home. Be cognizant that some heated beds come with cords that are chewing hazards, and others present burn risks if your cat uses them unmonitored. Make sure to follow any safety recommendations and instructions that are provided when you purchase a heated bed.

Prevention of Hypothermia in Cats
To prevent hypothermia in cats, the best thing pet parents can do is keep their cats indoors. If your cat must go outside, ensure you are providing a shelter away from wind and precipitation.

We also recommend regular veterinary wellness appointments to monitor for predisposing health conditions.

350,Hypokalemia in Cats,"What Is Hypokalemia in Cats?
Hypokalemia in cats is the medical term for low levels of potassium in the blood. Potassium is an electrolyte that is important for many of your cat’s essential life functions, from sending signals between nerves to maintaining your cat’s heartbeat.

Small changes in potassium levels can have significant impacts on the function of your cat’s muscles and nerves. Cats with hypokalemia often act weak and fatigued, and they may hang their head downward. Hypokalemia causes muscle pain and weakness, which is uncomfortable for cats.

Significant elevations in potassium are life-threatening. While studies haven’t established a relationship between low blood potassium levels and mortality in cats, some of the conditions that cause hypokalemia can be fatal.

If you are concerned that your cat has hypokalemia, call your veterinarian immediately.

Symptoms of Hypokalemia in Cats
Symptoms of hypokalemia in cats include:


	
	Muscle weakness, potentially muscle paralysis
	
	
	Limb pain
	
	
	Head hanging downward (limp neck)
	
	
	Acting fatigued or mentally dull
	
	
	Drinking and urinating a lot (polydipsia and polyuria)
	
	
	Constipation
	
	
	Abnormal heart rhythm
	
	
	Shallow breathing
	


Keep in mind that hypokalemia often occurs secondary to another condition, so your cat could have other symptoms related to the main cause.

Causes of Hypokalemia in Cats
Hypokalemia in cats usually occurs due to a loss of potassium that happens alongside another health condition. Causes that fall under this category include:


	
	Chronic and/or severe vomiting
	
	
	Chronic and/or severe diarrhea
	
	
	Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
	
	
	Hyperaldosteronism due to abnormal growth of adrenal glands (rare)
	


It’s possible for cats to have hypokalemia due to low potassium intake, such as if they’re starved or fed a diet low in potassium. Always feed your cat appropriate amounts of a balanced diet formulated for cats. If your cat has a poor appetite or isn’t eating, contact your veterinarian.

A cat of any breed or age can develop hypokalemia, but some of the potential causes are more common in specific ages or breeds of cats. For example, hypokalemia due to CKD is more common in senior cats.

One hereditary condition caused by a genetic mutation is called hypokalemic periodic polymyopathy, and is more common in these cat breeds:


	
	Burmese
	
	
	Bombay
	
	
	Tonkinese
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypokalemia in Cats
Diagnosis of hypokalemia requires a blood sample. The normal blood tests that your veterinarian runs usually include potassium levels. If your cat’s potassium level is lower than normal (3.5 mEq/L), they will be diagnosed with hypokalemia.

Additional diagnostics might include urinalysis (testing urine) or imaging to try to figure out what is causing the low potassium. Other electrolyte levels, such as sodium and chloride, will be looked at as well.

Share with your veterinarian if you’ve noticed any of the following:


	
	Your cat is drinking more water than usual.
	
	
	Your cat is peeing more than usual or having accidents.
	
	
	Your cat has been vomiting.
	
	
	Your cat is having diarrhea.
	
	
	Your cat hasn’t been eating or is uninterested in food.
	


 Treatment of Hypokalemia in Cats
Treatment of hypokalemia in cats will focus on the underlying cause.

For example, a cat with chronic kidney disease should go on a kidney diet and may need additional fluid supplementation. A cat with hypokalemia due to chronic vomiting should have the cause of vomiting diagnosed and treated, but when it comes to the hypokalemia itself, your veterinarian can supplement potassium to increase your cat’s levels.

In severe cases or when your cat is acutely ill, this can include adding potassium to fluids given intravenously (IV). If your hypokalemic cat is hospitalized, this is a common way to supplement potassium.

If your cat has a chronically low potassium, your veterinarian may recommend supplementing additional potassium orally.

Potassium gluconate in the form of a gel or powder is common. Your veterinarian will tell you how much and how often to give potassium gluconate, but it’s usually two to three times per day.

Recovery and Management of Hypokalemia in Cats
Some cases of hypokalemia in cats will resolve as the cat recovers from the underlying cause. For example, a cat who is hypokalemic from vomiting will usually return to normal potassium levels once they stop vomiting and start eating a normal, healthy diet.

Outside of managing the cause, you may not need to take any extra steps. While your cat is in the hospital, their potassium levels may be measured several times a day.

However, some cases of hypokalemia will require lifelong management. For instance, a cat with chronic kidney disease will be on a renal diet and may need potassium supplementation for life. While your cat’s potassium levels may return to normal with supplementation, frequent rechecks will be needed and hypokalemia will develop again if you stop the supplements.

Prevention of Hypokalemia in Cats
To prevent hypokalemia, seek veterinary attention for chronic vomiting or diarrhea. Keep your cat on preventives to protect them from parasites that could cause vomiting or diarrhea.

Take your cat to their regular wellness exams, which should include lab work if recommended by your veterinarian. Young and mature adult cats should see their veterinarian at least once a year, while senior cats should see the veterinarian at least twice annually.

351,Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Cats,"What Is Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Cats?
Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main source of energy for both the body and the brain. Low levels of blood glucose, called hypoglycemia, will deprive the body and brain of energy, resulting in unconsciousness. If left untreated, it can lead to death. The opposite condition, high blood glucose levels, is often a sign of diabetes mellitus.

Hypoglycemia is the most common side effect of insulin administration for the treatment of diabetes. The effects of insulin are long-lasting (working for hours), so complications from an overdose will worsen with time, and a pet can progress from stable to critical condition very quickly. As noted, if left untreated, hypoglycemia can be fatal to your cat.

	Lack of coordination/stumbling
	
	
	Anxiety
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	
	
	Death
	


Causes of Hypoglycemia in Cats
Cats under treatment for diabetes are at a higher risk for developing hypoglycemia. Mistakes that can be made when administering insulin include:


	
	Giving too much insulin
	
	
	Using a mismatched needle and syringe
	
	
	Missing or delaying meals
	
	
	Change in the diet or amount fed
	
	
	Change in time of insulin administration
	


Other causes of hypoglycemia in cats that are unrelated to the administration of insulin for diabetic patients include:


	
	Infection or illness
	
	
	Decreased appetite or vomiting
	
	
	Change in the body’s need for insulin
	
	
	Concurrent hormonal disease
	
	
	Interaction of insulin with other medications
	
	
	Increase in activity
	
	
	Heatstroke
	
	
	Liver disease
	
	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Remission of diabetes
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypoglycemia in Cats
Hypoglycemia can be easily diagnosed in the hospital. A blood glucose level check will reveal a lower-than-normal blood glucose level. In combination with your cat’s history and clinical signs at the hospital, a diagnosis can be made for hypoglycemia.

To determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia, a thorough history and review of the insulin administration is required. If inappropriate administration does not appear to be the cause of the hypoglycemia, the following tests may be performed:


	
	Blood Chemistry Profile: to assess the health and function of the liver, kidneys, and pancreas
	
	
	Complete Blood Count: to identify abnormal red and white blood cell counts and patterns, which could identify an underlying disease such as anemia, dehydration, or infection
	
	
	Urinalysis: to evaluate kidney function and check for a urinary tract infection
	
	
	Cortisol Test: to reveal abnormalities in the body’s stress hormone, which could affect its ability to metabolize insulin
	
	
	Thyroid Test: to evaluate the amount of thyroid hormone
	
	
	Imaging: X-rays and ultrasounds are used to check for tumors, abscesses, infection in the abdomen, liver shunts, and liver abnormalities
	


Treatment of Hypoglycemia in Cats
Initially, treatment is aimed at raising low blood glucose levels. Depending on the severity of the blood glucose level and the clinical signs at the time of the diagnosis, treatment can vary to include:


	
	Oral Options at Home: If you notice any symptoms of hypoglycemia (as listed above), take your cat to the hospital immediately. For transport to the hospital, pet parents can apply Karo® corn syrup or honey to the gums only. (Do not force anything to be swallowed or into the mouth.) When you arrive at the hospital, be sure to inform the staff of any home treatments you started.
	


It is important to note that hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can produce similar signs in cats (stupor, depression, lethargy), so without confirmation of low blood glucose levels, or a known insulin overdose, do not apply more Karo syrup or honey to the gums in diabetic patients.


	
	Oral Options at the Hospital: Similar to options at home, a source of glucose is applied to the gums. In the hospital, cats are monitored for changes in their clinical signs and improving blood glucose levels. If levels are very low or cats are not responding to the gum application, an intravenous administration is typically started.
	
	
	Intravenous (IV): The application of glucose to the gums is not as effective as intravenous dextrose. A continuous-rate infusion is beneficial for cats that do not respond to an initial IV dextrose injection.
	
	
	Supportive Care: In severe cases of hypoglycemia, appropriate nutrition and warming are needed. Seizures are treated with anticonvulsant medication.
	


Once the patient is stable, further investigation of the cause of the hypoglycemia can be performed.

Recovery and Management of Hypoglycemia in Cats
The clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia should improve within minutes of treatment. In cases of a large insulin overdose, however, repeated treatments are needed over time to counteract the long-lasting action of insulin. In those cases, cats may be kept in the hospital for a continuous infusion of dextrose.

Pet parents of a cat with diabetes should always have a source of glucose and a blood glucose monitor readily available to treat confirmed hypoglycemia following an insulin overdose. After an administration of glucose alleviates the obvious signs of hypoglycemia and a cat can eat on their own, small amounts of food should be offered every 1-2 hours until the effects of the insulin overdose have been counteracted.

Ways to decrease hypoglycemia from an insulin overdose include:


	
	Maintain strict feeding times (same times each day)
	
	
	Administer insulin near the time of eating
	
	
	Avoid changes in the diet/food (including treats)
	
	
	Schedule routine bloodwork monitoring as suggested
	
	
	Provide a consistent level of exercise and play each day
	


Keeping in mind the symptoms of hypoglycemia in cats and ways to decrease hypoglycemia from an insulin overdose, you’ll be best prepared to keep your cat safe.

352,Hyperthyroidism in Cats: Symptoms and Treatment,"Hyperthyroidism in cats is a disease that’s usually caused by a benign tumor within the thyroid gland. This tumor causes an overproduction of the thyroid hormone called thyroxine. One of the primary functions of this thyroid hormone is to regulate an animal’s metabolism. 

Cats with too much thyroid hormone have a greatly increased metabolic rate, which leads them to lose weight despite having a ravenous appetite. Other symptoms can include anxiety, vomiting, diarrhea, and increased thirst and urination.

These excessive hormone levels push a cat’s body into constant overdrive, which frequently leads to high blood pressure and a type of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 

Here’s everything you should know about hyperthyroidism in cats so you can spot the signs and get your cat on a treatment plan as soon as possible.

How Common Is Hyperthyroidism in Cats? 

There is no known genetic predisposition for hyperthyroidism, but it is quite common in cats. 

In fact, hyperthyroidism is the most common hormonal (endocrine) disease in the cat population, often seen in late middle-aged and older cats. 

The average age of diagnosis is approximately 13 years. The possible age range is 4-20 years, although seeing young hyperthyroid cats is very rare.

What Does the Thyroid Gland Do?

In cats, the thyroid gland has two parts, with one on each side of the trachea (windpipe), just below the larynx (voice box).

The thyroid gland makes several different hormones (mostly thyroxine, or T4). These thyroid hormones affect many of your cat’s body processes:


	Regulation of body temperature
	Metabolism of fats and carbohydrates
	Weight gain and loss
	Heart rate and cardiac output
	Nervous system function
	Growth and brain development in young animals
	Reproduction
	Muscle tone
	Skin condition


Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism in Cats

Here are the major symptoms of hyperthyroidism that you should look for in your cat:


	Weight loss
	Increased appetite (ravenous)
	Unkempt appearance
	Poor body condition
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Drinking more than usual (polydipsia)
	Peeing more than usual (polyuria)
	Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
	Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
	Heart murmur; rapid heart rate; an abnormal heartbeat known as a “gallop rhythm”
	Hyperactivity/restlessness
	Aggression
	Enlarged thyroid gland, which feels like a lump on the neck
	Thickened nails


Less than 10% of cats suffering from hyperthyroidism exhibit atypical signs such as poor appetite, loss of appetite, depression, and weakness.

What Causes Cats to Be Hyperthyroid?

Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules (where the thyroid nodules produce excess thyroid hormones outside of the control of the pituitary gland) cause hyperthyroidism. But what causes the thyroid to go haywire?

 

There are several theories about what causes cats to become hyperthyroid:


	Rarely, thyroid cancer
	Some reports have linked hyperthyroidism in cats to some fish-flavored canned food diets
	Research has pointed to flame-retardant chemicals (PBDEs) that are used in some furniture and carpeting and circulated in house dust
	Advancing age increases risk


How Do Vets Test for Feline Hyperthyroidism?

In most cases, diagnosing hyperthyroidism is straightforward: high levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream (total T4 or TT4) along with the typical signs. 

In some cases, however, your cat’s T4 levels may be in the normal range, making a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism more difficult. This is especially true in the early stages of this disease. 

If your cat is showing the symptoms of hyperthyroidism but the blood tests are not conclusive, you will need to return to your veterinarian for further blood tests or for a referral for a thyroid scan.

The signs of feline hyperthyroidism can also overlap with those of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic hepatic disease, and cancer (especially intestinal lymphoma). 

These diseases can be excluded on the basis of routine laboratory findings and thyroid function tests. Your veterinarian will conduct a battery of tests to zero in on a reliable diagnosis.

Kidney disease is commonly diagnosed along with hyperthyroidism in cats. Cats suffering from both diseases may need treatment for both, and the diagnosis of kidney disease in a cat with hyperthyroidism can affect the cat’s prognosis. 

Treatment for Hyperthyroid Cats

The gold standard therapy is radioiodine (I131) treatment, which can cure the hyperthyroidism in most cases. Daily medication (methimazole) or feeding a low-iodine diet are good options when radioiodine therapy is not an option due to financial considerations or the cat’s overall health.

Radioiodine Therapy (Radioactive Iodine Treatment)

Radioiodine therapy, or I131 treatment, uses radioactive iodine to kill the diseased tissue in the thyroid gland. Most cats undergoing I131 treatment are cured of the disease with one treatment.  

The cat’s thyroid levels are monitored after treatment. Rare cases require a second treatment. Hypothyroidism is not common after treatment, but it can occur, and it can be managed with a daily thyroid medication.

The use of radioiodine is restricted to a confined medical facility, since the treatment itself is radioactive. Depending on the state you live in and the guidelines in place, your cat will need to be hospitalized from several days to a few weeks after being treated with radioactive medicine, to allow the radioactive material to leave your cat’s body before coming home.

Precautions will still need to be taken after bringing your cat home. Your veterinarian will give you specific instructions to reduce your risk of exposure to the radioactive material, which will probably include storing your cat’s used litter in a sealed container for a period of time before disposing of it in the garbage.

 

Surgically Removing the Thyroid Gland

Surgical removal of the diseased thyroid gland is another potential treatment. Like I131 treatment, surgical treatment is curative, but these cats also must be monitored afterward for hypothyroidism.

Surgical removal of the thyroid gland is best performed when only one thyroid gland is affected, as removal of both can possibly lead to hypothyroidism. Another complication that can occur after surgical removal of the affected thyroid gland is the successive hyperactivity of the remaining thyroid gland.

Methimazole Medication

Giving your cat a medication called methimazole is probably the most common treatment choice. It’s administered by mouth in pill form, or it can be formulated by a compounding pharmacy into a transdermal gel that can be applied to your cat’s ear. Methimazole is often given before radioiodine treatment or surgery to stabilize your cat’s clinical signs.  

Methimazole is effective in controlling the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, it does not cure the disease—your cat will need to receive the medication for the rest of his life. If a cat is younger at diagnosis (under 10 years old) and does not have underlying diseases, the cost of methimazole for a lifetime may exceed surgery or radioiodine. 

Methimazole has rare but significant side effects in some cats, so make sure to make and keep regular monitoring appointments with your veterinarian. 

Iodine-Restricted Diet

 

Feeding a diet that restricts iodine is a newer alternative for treatment of feline hyperthyroidism. Like methimazole treatment, this alternative is not curative, and your cat will require lifelong treatment. 

This diet must be given exclusively. The hyperthyroid cat on this diet must not have access to or be given any treats, other cat food, or human food. Other cats in the household may eat this food, but they must be supplemented with an appropriate cat food for their age and health in order to provide adequate iodine. 

Follow-Up Care for Hyperthyroid Cats

Once treatment has begun, your veterinarian will need to reexamine your cat every two to three weeks for the initial three months of treatment, with a complete blood count to check their T4. Treatment will be adjusted based on the results, such as changing methimazole dosage to maintain T4 concentration in the low-normal range.

If your cat has had surgery, particularly removal of the thyroid gland, your veterinarian will want to closely observe your cat's physical recovery. Development of low blood-calcium levels and/or paralysis of the voice box during the initial postoperative period are complications that will need to be watched for and treated, should they occur. 

Your doctor will also measure your cat’s thyroid hormone levels in the first week after surgery and every three to six months thereafter, to check for recurrence of thyroid gland overactivity.

353,Hyperparathyroidism in Cats,"Excessive Levels of Parathyroid Hormone in the Blood in Cats

 

Hyperparathyroidism is medical condition in which abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone or PTH) are circulating in the blood as the result of an overactive parathyroid gland. The parathyroid hormone is responsible for regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from bone. The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands. The term para- refers to adjacent or alongside, and thyroid refers to the actual thyroid gland; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are located side by side in the neck, near the windpipe or trachea

 

Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to a condition in which a tumor in the parathyroid gland produces excessive levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia).

 

Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, and is associated with malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease.

 

There is no known genetic cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, but its association with certain breeds suggests a possible hereditary basis in some cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in association with hereditary kidney disease (known as hereditary nephropathy), but is not inherited per se. Siamese cats seem to show some predilection for this disease. In cats, the average age is 13 years, with a range of 8 to 15 years of age.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Most cats with primary hyperparathyroidism do not appear ill
	Signs are usually mild and are due solely to the effects of high levels of calcium in the blood
	Increased urination
	Increased thirst
	Lack of appetite
	Sluggishness
	Vomiting
	Weakness
	Presence of stones in the urinary tract
	Stupor and coma
	Veterinarian may be able to feel enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck
	Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by diets that have too little calcium and vitamin D or too much phosphorus – it is a type of malnutrition
	Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism sometimes is associated with bone fractures and general poor body condition


 

Causes

 


	Primary hyperparathyroidism – PTH-secreting tumor of the parathyroid gland; in most cases only one gland has a tumor; malignant tumors of the parathyroid glands are uncommon
	Secondary hyperparathyroidism is related to malnutrition – nutritional deficiency of calcium and vitamin D or nutritional excess of phosphorus
	Secondary hyperparathyroidism is also related to long-term (chronic) kidney disease. Calcium is lost through the kidneys and absorption of calcium is reduced through the intestinal tract due to deficiency of a hormone known as calcitriol (which regulates levels and absorption of calcium in the intestines), which is produced by the kidneys; may also be due to the retention of phosphorus in the body
	Primary hyperparathyroidism – unknown
	Secondary hyperparathyroidism – related to calcium/vitamin D malnutrition or to long-term (chronic) kidney disease




  



Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will be looking for cancer first and foremost for the cause for this disease. However, several other possibilities will also be considered, such as renal failure and vitamin D intoxication, which have been known to be found in some rodenticides. Other possibilities are too much calcium in the blood in cats. A urinalysis will reveal calcium and phosphate levels.

 

Serum ionized calcium determination is often normal in patients with chronic renal failure and high in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia that is associated with a malignancy. If kidney stones are suspected, your veterinarian may use x-ray and ultrasound imaging of the parathyroid gland to discover whether there is tumor there. If nothing can be found using these diagnostic techniques, your veterinarian may need to use surgery to explore the area of the thyroid and parathyroid.

 



Treatment

 

Primary hyperparathyroidism generally requires inpatient care and surgery. Secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease in non-critical patients can be managed on an outpatient basis. Your veterinarian may recommend calcium supplements to stabilize the levels of calcium in the blood and intestines. Low phosphorus diets for secondary hyperparathyroidism related to long-term kidney disease may be recommended as well. Surgery is the treatment of choice for primary hyperparathyroidism and is often important in establishing the diagnosis. If a tumor is found, the best resolution is often surgical removal of the tumor. Medications will be prescribed according to the final diagnosis and treatment plan.

 

Prevention

 

No strategies exist for prevention of primary hyperparathyroidism; however, secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition can be prevented by proper nutrition.



Living and Management

 

Postoperative low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) is relatively common after surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands for treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients with presurgical calcium concentrations greater than 14 mg/d. Your veterinarian will want to check serum calcium concentrations once or twice daily for at least one week after surgery, and will schedule your cat for regular blood tests to check the status of the kidney.

354,Hyperparathyroidism Due to Kidney Failure in Cats,"Abnormally High levels of Parathyroid Hormone due to Chronic Kidney Failure in Cats

The excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to chronic kidney failure is medically referred to as secondary hyperparathyroidism. More specifically, the cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is  absolute or relative lack of calcitriol production -- a form of vitamin D  that stimulates the absorption of calcium in the intestines, calcium  resorption in bone, and promotes the effectiveness of the parathyroid  hormone in aiding bone resorption. Low concentrations of calcium also  play a role in increased levels of PTH in blood.
  
Symptoms

The majority of symptoms relate to the underlying cause of chronic kidney failure. In some patients with chronic kidney disease, bone resorption starts around the teeth and jaw, causing a loosening of the teeth and a softening of the lower jaw, a condition known in the medical community as “rubber jaw.”

Causes

Any underlying disease that causes chronic kidney failure.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of the body systems.



Blood testing and biochemical profiles may reveal azotemia, an accumulation of  toxic amounts of nitrogenous waste products (urea) in the blood, waste products that are usually excreted in the urine and voided from the body. This condition is also referred to as uremia. There may also be abnormally higher levels of the phosphate in the blood and abnormally low levels of the calcium in the blood.  For definitive diagnosis, your veterinarian will perform measurements of serum PTH concentrations. Moreover, low to normal concentrations of calcium in the blood will help in confirming a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Bone X-rays are also helpful in determining bone density, especially around the teeth.

Treatment

Treating the underlying kidney disease is a major goal of therapy in patients that have been diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Abnormally high levels of phosphorous in the blood is treated by using chemicals that bind to the excess phosphorous in the blood, and the diet is controlled to limit phosphorous ingestion by way of food.

To overcome calcitriol deficiency, calcitriol is given to increase calcium levels, but in very small doses that are calculated by your veterinarian based on your cat's specific need.

Living and Management

Depending on the severity of kidney failure, it is very important to check the serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorous and urea nitrogen weekly or monthly. If your cat is receiving calcitriol, you will need to closely monitor the cat's condition, as calcitriol therapy may lead to some untoward symptoms or complications.

Your cat's parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations will also need to be checked on a regular basis. Though renal secondary hyperparathyroidism treatment may slow down the overall progression of kidney failure, the long-term prognosis is frequently very poor in these patients.","

355,Hypercalcemia in Cats,"What Is Hypercalcemia in Cats?
Hypercalcemia means that a cat's calcium level is higher than normal in the bloodstream. Calcium is an essential mineral that keeps a cat's bones strong and helps with muscle contraction, the clotting of blood, and other essential functions. The amount of calcium in a cat's body is closely regulated, so only the amount needed is normally available at any given time. However, certain medical conditions can cause the calcium level to become too high.

There are many possible causes for a cat's calcium level to be elevated. Some may be lifelong issues, while others are only temporary. If a cat has significant hypercalcemia that persists, then the extra calcium will build up in multiple organs, leading to mineralization. Organs that have mineralization are unable to function properly.

For instance, high calcium can prevent the muscles throughout the body from contracting, such as within the heart, limbs, and gastrointestinal tract. A cat with hypercalcemia may develop weakness, muscle wasting, impaired heart function, and a decreased appetite, as well as other symptoms. Hypercalcemia can be life-threatening because it can lead to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat, chronic gastrointestinal issues, and inability to walk.

Symptoms of Hypercalcemia
Cats with mild hypercalcemia often do not show signs of illness. But if a cat’s total calcium level rises over a certain level, then these symptoms may be seen:

Neuromuscular


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Muscle wasting
	
	
	Muscle tremors or twitching
	
	
	Inability to walk
	
	
	Seizures
	


Gastrointestinal


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Anorexia
	
	
	Constipation or diarrhea
	
	
	Vomiting
	


Renal/Urinary tract


	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	If bladder stones form in the urine due to calcium buildup, a cat may have blood in the urine and strain to urinate small amounts.
	


Cardiac


	
	Heart arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat)
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Collapse
	


The above symptoms are usually seen at home by pet parents and then reported to the veterinarian during an appointment. However, some cats with hypercalcemia have no symptoms, and the only way to detect this medical condition is for your veterinary professional to measure your cat's calcium level with a blood test during an annual exam.

Causes of Hypercalcemia
Cats can develop hypercalcemia due to several causes:


	
	Idiopathic hypercalcemia: This medical condition is the most common cause.  It means that after running numerous diagnostic tests, no cause for a cat's elevated calcium level can be found and all known medical conditions have been ruled out.
	
	
	Renal (kidney) disease: When a cat has severe kidney disease, the kidneys can no longer function properly, which leads to a cascade of unfortunate events. Ultimately, mineral deposits form within soft tissue, including the kidneys, leading to even poorer kidney function.
	
	Hypercalcemia of malignancy: Some cancers release a protein that stimulates the breakdown of bone tissue, allowing calcium to be released from the bone into the bloodstream, where it builds up.


The two most common cancers that cause hypercalcemia in cats are lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Other types of cancers such as mammary cancer, cancer within the anal sac, and multiple myeloma are less common.


	
	Primary hyperparathyroidism: Occasionally a benign or cancerous mass can develop in one or more parathyroid glands in a cat’s neck. A benign mass called a parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism in cats. When a mass is present within the parathyroid gland, it overproduces parathyroid stimulating hormone (PTH) that controls calcium levels in the bloodstream. Whether it is benign or cancerous, excess PTH leads to resorption of bone and a release of extra calcium into the bloodstream, causing hypercalcemia.
	
	
	Hypoadrenocorticism: This endocrine disorder, also known as Addison’s disease, is very rare in cats and develops when the adrenal glands are unable to produce glucocorticoids (steroids) and mineralocorticoids. Cats with this condition are typically lethargic, lose weight, and have anorexia. Hypercalcemia can occasionally be seen in the bloodwork of a cat that has hypoadrenocorticism.
	
	
	Vitamin D toxicosis: Too much vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Cats can consume a toxic dose of the vitamin through diet or by ingesting rodenticide, a day-blooming jasmine plant, or eczema cream.
	
	
	Transient hypercalcemia: This is when a cat has dehydration due to lack of water or gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). Once the dehydration and underlying cause are corrected, the calcium level returns to normal in most cases. Further diagnostics or treatment are not needed unless GI symptoms recur.
	
	
	Fungal infections: Cryptococcus neoformans, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and bacterial infections caused by atypical mycobacterium or Actinomyces spp. can cause hypercalcemia in cats.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypercalcemia in Cats
Depending on the cat and their health history, a veterinarian may use one or more of the following diagnostics to determine hypercalcemia in cats and how to treat it.


	
	Physical and rectal exams: A veterinarian can check for muscle wasting, muscle tremors, lethargy, decreased mobility, cancerous masses, enlarged lymph nodes, and an irregular heart beat.
	
	
	Bloodwork: A blood cell count (CBC), electrolytes, and chemistry panel that includes a total calcium level.  If the total calcium level is elevated, an ionized calcium level is recommended to confirm if the hypercalcemia is clinically significant.
	
	
	Urinalysis: This is done to screen for kidney disease.
	
	
	Fine needle aspiration: A small needle is used to obtain cells from an enlarged lymph node to screen for lymphoma and other forms of cancer.
	
	
	Parathyroid hormone assay: This blood panel helps test for hyperparathyroidism by measuring the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the bloodstream. If the level of PTH is elevated in a cat that has hypercalcemia, then primary hyperparathyroidism is likely the cause of the elevated calcium level.
	
	
	Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein (PTHrP) Assay: This is another blood test that measures the amount of parathyroid hormone-related protein in the bloodstream. If a hypercalcemic cat has elevated PTHrP, then cancer is likely present and the cause for the hypercalcemia.
	
	
	Ultrasound of the neck: A board-certified radiologist examines the parathyroid glands and thyroid gland to see if a tumor is present.
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound: It may be needed to screen for cancerous masses in the abdomen that can cause hypercalcemia.
	
	
	Advanced imaging: A CT scan or MRI screens for a cancerous mass that could be the cause of a cat's hypercalcemia.
	
	
	Bone marrow cytologic exam: This exam reviews cells within the bone marrow to screen for lymphoma and other forms of cancer.
	
	
	ACTH stimulation test: This blood test screens for hypoadrenocorticism.
	
	
	Fungal serology or culture: Tests used to determine if fungal infections are present.
	
	
	Bacterial culture: Used to check for bacterial infections.
	
	
	Vitamin D assay: A test used to determine if vitamin D toxicity is suspected.
	


Determining the cause for hypercalcemia can be costly, due to the number of diagnostic tests that may be needed. Sometimes the cause is never found, which leads to a diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalcemia.

Treatment of Hypercalcemia in Cats
Treatment for hypercalcemia depends upon the underlying cause. If a cause can be found and treated, then this should help to prevent future bouts of hypercalcemia. Also, cats showing signs of hypercalcemia and/or have a high calcium level require treatment to lower it.  

Treatment may involve:


	
	Fluid therapy: Intravenous fluids are needed to correct any dehydration, which is an important step because dehydration can worsen hypercalcemia. IV fluids are also helpful to clear the kidneys of excess calcium by excreting it into the urine. 
	
	
	Diuretic medication: Furosemide may be needed to prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing calcium. It is crucial that the cat is always hydrated and has access to water. Without access to water, furosemide can cause a cat to become dehydrated.
	
	
	Steroid: Prednisolone reduces the ability for bone and the intestines to absorb calcium and helps the kidneys to excrete excess calcium into the urine. By doing so, this medication lowers the amount of calcium in the bloodstream.  
	
	
	Alendronate: This is an oral medication that is often prescribed when a cat is diagnosed with idiopathic hypercalcemia. Alendronate reduces bone resorption of calcium and helps to slow down bone loss.
	
	
	Diet: A change in diet may be indicated for cats with idiopathic hypercalcemia. A canned diet should be given instead of a dry cat formula to promote hydration. There are prescription canned diets to choose from that have helped with decreasing calcium levels (GI and renal diets) or minimizing the risk for calcium oxalate bladder stones (urinary diets), such as:

	
		
		High-fiber gastrointestinal diet (Royal Canin Gastrointestinal Fiber Response, Purina OM, or Hill’s w/d)
		
		
		Renal diet (Royal Canin Renal diets, Purina NF, or Hill’s k/d)
		
		
		Urinary diet (Royal Canin Urinary SO, Purina UR, Hill’s c/d)
		
	
	


Recovery and Management of Hypercalcemia in Cats
After treatment has begun, your veterinarian will perform bloodwork to monitor the calcium level and determine the next steps of treatment. A cat that has previously had hypercalcemia can develop this condition again if the underlying cause is not identified and treated properly, or if treatment is not given as directed.

Most causes of hypercalcemia develop out of our control and cannot be prevented. The key is to keep your cat hydrated and bring your cat to your local veterinarian for a physical exam and bloodwork (which includes a calcium level check) every 6-12 months to allow for early detection.

356,Hydrocephalus in Cats,"What Is Hydrocephalus in Cats?
Hydrocephalus occurs when there is too much cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, commonly referred to as “water on the brain.” CSF is made by the brain ventricles, hollow spaces inside the brain matter, and it bathes the brain and spinal cord. It normally provides much-needed nutrients and protection from pressure changes and physical trauma.

In cats, hydrocephalus is considered a rare condition and usually occurs because of a congenital birth defect, when the developing skull bones at first grow to adapt to the increased fluid. Then when the skull bones stop growing and fuse, there is no longer space for extra fluid, and pressure within the skull increases. This damages the brain, leading to neurologic signs.

Hydrocephalus can also develop after traumatic brain injury, infection, or cancer. Essentially, anything that would either block the flow of the CSF from the brain and down the spinal cord or cause an increase in its production can lead to hydrocephalus.

It’s usually only considered an emergency in an acute setting—usually an older cat having just experienced some sort of trauma or having severe neurologic dysfunction. For many cats, even with therapy, the disease progresses, and many are humanely euthanized.

Symptoms of Hydrocephalus in Cats 
Symptoms of congenital hydrocephalus usually shows up a few months after birth, but many cats may not develop symptoms until well into adulthood. Affected kittens may be described as:


	
	Smaller in size than their littermates
	
	
	Having a dome-shaped skull (congenital and acquired)
	
	
	Having open fontanelles (soft spot)
	
	
	Having bilateral ventrolateral strabismus, where a cat’s eyes appear to be looking downward and outward (congenital and acquired)
	
	
	Having variable neurologic dysfunction (congenital and acquired):

	
		
		Changes in behavior
		
		
		Restlessness
		
		
		Head pressing
		
		
		Walking in circles
		
		
		Altered walk (often appearing clumsy)
		
		
		Tetraparesis (weakness in all four limbs)
		
		
		Seizures, though less likely
		
		
		Blindness
		
	
	


Causes of Hydrocephalus in Cats
Hydrocephalus in cats is generally classified into two categories:


	
	Congenital—Congenital hydrocephalus is more common, with birth defects affecting the cerebellum and/or skull. It often occurs with other diseases such as syringomyelia (fluid pockets that develop within the spinal cord).

	
		
		It is thought that this condition is inherited in breeds such as the Siamese, but it has been known to occur in other breeds like the Persian and Manx. Additionally, kittens exposed to the feline panleukopenia virus or certain toxins/medications such as griseofulvin before birth can develop hydrocephalus along with other birth defects.
		
	
	
	
	Acquired—Any disease that blocks the CSF flow or any loss of brain tissue such as in the case of trauma and hemorrhage; cysts; inflammation (swelling); bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (feline infectious peritonitis); and cancer can lead to a backup of CSF into the brain or greater amounts being made.
	


 How Veterinarians Diagnose Hydrocephalus in Cats
Diagnosis of hydrocephalus is made after finding certain characteristics during a physical examination and in imaging of the skull and brain. Cats will often have a dome-shaped head and neurologic dysfunction to some degree.

If trauma is known to have occurred, be sure to mention the details with your veterinarian, as some cases of acquired hydrocephalus require immediate lifesaving treatment. 

Radiographs are also helpful, as they will show a dome-shaped yet thin-walled cranium, but the diagnosis is best made with ultrasound through the open fontanelles or with a CT scan or an MRI.

Analysis of the CSF along with a culture will most likely be recommended to rule out other conditions and to help with surgical therapy. Blood work such as a complete blood cell count, internal organ function screening test, and feline leukemia and feline AIDS (FIV) testing will also be done.

 Treatment of Hydrocephalus in Cats
Treatment of hydrocephalus in cats is usually aimed at the underlying cause, if known, but it usually doesn’t lead to long-term healing, since the disease is progressive. Medical management offers temporary relief in symptoms and is usually considered palliative (not a cure). Many cats require lifelong therapy.

Certain drugs such as furosemide and prednisolone can be given, as they lower the amount of CSF made; however, cats will need to be checked often and have frequent blood work because of drug side effects such as kidney injury, heart disease, and diabetes.

In the acute setting, a drug such as mannitol may be given to lower the pressure within the brain.

Surgical management has risks but can often lead to a better long-term prognosis, with a surgical success rate anywhere from 50 to 75 percent, especially for those with a congenital cause. Cats with severe neurologic problems and those that have failed medical management are often recommended for surgery. There are several surgical techniques, but all involve the surgical placement of a shunt, or small tube, within the brain that is then tunneled underneath the skin and connected elsewhere in the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt sends extra CSF into another area of the body, where it is easily absorbed.

Cats with a CSF infection or infection elsewhere in the body or cats with abnormal CSF are often unable to receive surgery.

Cats with hydrocephalus secondary to cancer may undergo more surgeries, radiation, or chemotherapy. Immunosuppressive drugs like steroids may be used for cats with auto-immune related causes. Antibiotics and antifungal agents may be prescribed for infectious causes.

Recovery and Management of Hydrocephalus in Cats
The prognosis for cats suffering from hydrocephalus is poor. Some cats may have little pain and can manage well with medication alone, but those suffering from extreme pain or neurologic issues are less likely to recover.

Additionally, as cats affected with hydrocephalus often have neurologic problems, it is recommended to keep them away from others and away from stairs, pools, sharp corners, and other potential dangers, as their balance and coordination may be affected.

For cats having undergone surgery, recovery often takes several weeks. Some can go on to have a fairly functional life if no permanent neurologic damage occurred because of the increased pressure on the brain. Other cats may show lifelong neurologic symptoms that are mild, such as difficulty walking or trouble with future training.

A recovery cone may also be needed during recovery to prevent your cat from scratching at the shunt. Some complications can arise after surgery in cats receiving a shunt, such as infection; shunt failure from blockage, kinking, or bending; or too much draining of CSF, which can lead to low intracranial pressure and subdural hematoma (brain bruise) formation.

If you notice anything out of place or your cat’s symptoms worsening, be sure to have them examined right away!

If your cat is prescribed medication, chances are they will be on those for a long time, if not for life, so do not stop them unless told to do so by your veterinarian. The significance of these medications’ side effects is high, so future follow-ups with drug checks and blood work will be needed.

It’s important to work with your vet to help manage your cat’s condition and ensure the best outcome possible, as their pain and symptoms will most likely worsen over time, needing more follow-ups or testing.

Prevention of Hydrocephalus in Cats
Unfortunately, there’s little you can do to prevent hydrocephalus from happening, but having your cat examined at the first sign may lead to a better prognosis while minimizing its harmful effects.

Keeping your cat indoors and having them routinely examined and up to date on their vaccines and flea and heartworm preventive is very important, along with preventing head injuries, which can occur from motor vehicle accidents or falls.

Additionally, as the condition is thought to have a genetic trait, cats with this condition and cats that are carriers (i.e., breeding pairs) shouldn’t be bred, because of the possibility of passing on harmful traits.
Hydrocephalus in Cats FAQs Can cats survive hydrocephalus? Yes, cats who have undergone a successful surgery to send extra CSF to the abdomen, known as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, can go on to have a fairly functional life if no permanent neurologic damage occurred, or they may have lifelong mild dysfunction such as difficulty walking or clumsiness. Still others, having been treated medically, may have a poor quality of life and humane euthanasia will be recommended.
 What is the life expectancy for cats with hydrocephalus?The life expectancy of hydrocephalic cats varies based on how severe the symptoms are. But since the prognosis is generally poor, especially for cats with congenital causes, many are humanely euthanized within months of diagnosis.
Is hydrocephalus painful for cats?It certainly can be painful, especially if left untreated. This is why it’s important to have your cat examined at the first sign of a problem.

As the fluid gathers within the skull, increased pressure develops on the brain, which can lead to hematomas and a general state of stupor, malaise, and nausea. People who have hydrocephalus report feelings of frequent headaches and migraines, which is a good way to describe a similar state in cats.

360,Hot Spots on Cats,"What Are Hot Spots on Cats?
Hot spots are superficial skin infections that are caused by a cat licking, chewing, scratching, or biting at the skin’s surface. Cats have a normal amount of bacteria, yeast, and fungus on the skin. When the skin is disturbed or irritated by a cat’s actions, it causes the bacteria to overpopulate, creating a skin infection called a pyoderma.

The terms “acute moist dermatitis” and “pyotraumatic dermatitis” are often used to describe hot spots on cats. Long-haired cats and those with thicker coats may be more likely to get hot spots because they have a higher chance for inciting factors to get trapped under the coat and irritate the skin.

Hot spots are more common during hot, humid summer months but can occur year-round, depending on the inciting cause. Hot spots are commonly found on a cat’s face/chin, belly, or base of the tail, although they can be on any part of the body. These skin lesions are often painful and should be treated by your veterinarian as soon as possible.

Symptoms of Hot Spots on Cats
A hot spot–induced skin infection is initially moist, itchy, and inflamed, usually causing the skin in the area to turn red with or without hair loss. The infection then leads to pus formation, causing the wound to become more wet. The moisture is then trapped in the remaining hair, causing mats to form on top of the wound.

The pus will dry and the damaged skin will adhere to this infection site, causing a crusty, moist bed of infection that is likely very uncomfortable to your cat. The matted fur will often disguise how severely affected the underlying skin might be. The chewing, biting, or scratching makes the hot spot much worse, so the sooner you can have your cat examined by their vet the better.

Causes of Hot Spots on Cats
While hot spots are more common in hot, humid climates and occur more in the spring and summer, they can happen during any time of year. Bugs or allergies might make your cat itchy year-round, thus causing hot spots. Cats with more dense, heavier hair coats are more likely to develop hot spots, as their saliva gets trapped under the fur and will infect the skin, causing an itch. Multiple species of Staphylococcus bacteria are the most common natural inhabitant on a cat’s skin and are the most common cause of a bacterial skin infection in cats. Staph infections are not usually contagious in cats. Hot spots in cats are caused by a variety of underlying conditions, such as:

Parasites or Insects

Fleas are the most common cause of hot spots on cats. Other parasites, such as mites (e.g., skin mange or ear mites), mosquitoes, or ants, can also cause a cat to scratch or bite in response to the pain or itch, causing a hot spot.

Allergies

Allergies are also a common cause of hot spots in cats. Flea allergies are common in cats and just one tiny flea or microscopic flea egg can cause a cat’s entire body to be incredibly itchy, causing them to self-inflict hot spots. Outdoor cats are exposed to more pollen and environmental causes of allergies and could be at higher risk for developing hot spots.

Stress, Anxiety, or Behavioral Issues

Cats are skilled self-groomers. Any change to a cat’s daily routine or their normal environment can cause them to be stressed, and their stress response is often to overgroom themselves. Overgrooming in cats leads to hair loss and skin infections, which in turn can cause hot spots.

Pain From Trauma, Injury, or Disease

Hot spots in certain areas of the body, such as over the hips or on the hind end, might indicate that your cat is experiencing pain or discomfort. The hips are a common place for arthritis and your cat may chew or bite at the painful area, causing a hot spot. Anal gland disease would also be a reason for your cat to focus on their hind end in a way that might lead first to a wound, then to a hot spot.

In general, a wound or injury anywhere on the body can lead to hot spots, as it takes only a few minutes of your cat chewing, biting, or scratching at the skin for the normal bacteria to overpopulate and a skin infection to begin.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Hot Spots on Cats
Hot spots on cats can often be diagnosed with a physical examination by your veterinarian. While the skin lesion itself might be diagnosed with the naked eye, sometimes it does require diagnostic testing to be able to determine the underlying cause to make sure that the itch or pain does not return.

If it is a primary skin issue, a skin scraping, skin cytology, or skin culture might be needed to isolate the primary bacteria, mite, or fungus causing the issue. If pain is suspected, such as with hot spots over the hips, x-rays might be necessary to look for conditions such as arthritis. It’s important to diagnose both the hot spot and the underlying cause to help prevent the issue from recurring.

Treatment of Hot Spots on Cats
While there are many treatment plans for hot spots on cats, the first step your veterinarian will do is remove all of the hair on and surrounding the lesion. They will use clippers or a special razor to expose the infected skin. Once the hair is gone, the moisture and pus that were trapped behind it can be removed and the skin can be thoroughly cleaned.

This also allows your veterinarian to visualize the extent of the hot spot, which may have had been hidden by the hair and crusting. Since hot spots can be painful, your veterinarian might choose to sedate your cat with pain medication during the cleaning procedure. After the hot spot is clipped and cleaned, your vet can perform testing on the skin, such as cytology, culture, or scraping, to help diagnose the underlying cause.

The skin infection component of a hot spot is often treated with a combination of topical and oral or injectable antibiotics. Topical products, such as wipes, cleansers, mousse, and shampoos, should contain chlorhexidine as the active ingredient, as this is an effective antibacterial agent.

Products for Hot Spots on Cats

Duoxo® S3 is a popular topical product line available over the counter that is great for skin infections and hot spot treatment. For a mite infection, a lime sulfur dip or medicated bathing might be indicated. If the infection is more severe, your veterinarian may prescribed one of the following oral or injectable prescription medications:


	
	Convenia®
	
	
	Cephalexin
	
	
	Clindamycin
	
	
	Clavamox®
	
	
	Onsior™
	
	
	Meloxicam
	
	
	Buprenorphine
	
	
	Tramadol
	
	
	Prednisolone
	
	
	Chlorpheniramine
	


If fleas are the cause of your cat’s hot spots and itchy skin, the fleas must be treated with preventatives (e.g., Revolution® Plus, Bravecto®) and/or oral medications such as Capstar®. Your home will also have to be disinfected. Your veterinarian will design a specific treatment plan for your cat, based on their symptoms and the underlying cause of the hot spot.

Recovery and Management of Hot Spots on Cats
A crucial part of healing any skin condition, especially hot spots, is making sure that your cat cannot reach the area to lick, scratch, chew, or bite it. Your cat should not be able to reach this area, as self-inflicted damage is a common cause of unhealed hot spots.

An Elizabethan collar, inflatable collar, or protective shirt will prevent your cat from being able to continue to cause damage to the skin. The goal would be to remove the collar or shirt only after all medications are done and the hot spot is completely healed. It is also never advised to cover your cat’s hot spots with a bandage, as that traps moisture and will not allow the area to heal.

Your veterinarian will give you a timeline for treatment based on your cat’s diagnosis. Hot spots can take weeks to months to heal, depending on the cause. It’s important to finish all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian and to return to the vet’s office for all follow-up appointments in a timely manner, to ensure that your cat is healing properly. It is important that only products safe for pets be used on a cat’s skin, as human products can be toxic to cats. Check with your veterinarian before using any topical products at home for your cat’s hot spot.

Hot spots can be prevented by staying in tune with your cat’s medical needs. Cats should have regular checkups with their veterinarian, at least once per year. At this appointment, your vet can diagnose and discuss any medical conditions such as allergies, pain, or stress, to make sure these conditions are well managed and not causing behaviors that lead to hot spots.

All cats, even if they do not go outdoors, should be on a regular flea and tick preventative. This is to protect them against both these parasites themselves, which can cause your cat to itch, as well as the diseases they may carry. Your veterinarian will prescribe the best flea and tick prevention for your cat based on its lifestyle, medical conditions, and your location. Keep in mind that hot spots can rapidly progress into a much bigger wound, so it’s important to have them examined by your vet no matter how small they might be.

A hot spot–induced skin infection is initially moist, itchy, and inflamed, usually causing the skin in the area to turn red with or without hair loss. The infection then leads to pus formation, causing the wound to become more wet. The moisture is then trapped in the remaining hair, causing mats to form on top of the wound.

The pus will dry and the damaged skin will adhere to this infection site, causing a crusty, moist bed of infection that is likely very uncomfortable to your cat. The matted fur will often disguise how severely affected the underlying skin might be. The chewing, biting, or scratching makes the hot spot much worse, so the sooner you can have your cat examined by their vet the better.

361,Horner's Syndrome in Cats,"What Is Horner’s Syndrome in Cats?
Horner’s syndrome in cats is a group of changes to the appearance of the eye that occurs because of damage to the nerves that supply the affected eye. Specifically, the nerves affected are part of the sympathetic nervous system. But what does that mean?

There’s a part of the nervous system that controls bodily functions without the cat’s control, and the same goes for us humans! This part of the nervous system is called the autonomic nervous system. Examples of functions controlled by the autonomic nervous system include pupil dilation or constriction, sweating, and intestinal movement.

The Sympathetic Nervous System and Parasympathetic Nervous System in Cats

The autonomic nervous system has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.

The parasympathetic system maintains a relaxed state and is thought of as the “rest and digest” branch. The sympathetic system, on the contrary, prepares the body for “fight or flight.” Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have an effect on the eyes.

The sympathetic nervous system dilates the pupil, opens the eyelid, and keeps the eye forward in its socket. Basically, it offers changes to the eye that help a cat in flight or fight see their surroundings better. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system constricts the pupil, raises the third eyelid, and retracts the eye into the socket. In a relaxed state, your cat doesn’t need a wide-open eye to survey its surroundings.

Both systems are always working in tandem, with the dominant system at any given moment determined by what is happening around the cat.

When damage occurs to the sympathetic nerves that control the eye, the parasympathetic nerves dominate, resulting in changes to the eye and creating Horner’s syndrome.

Horner’s syndrome in cats is not an emergency, but if you’ve noticed any signs of Horner’s, contact your veterinarian. Horner’s syndrome is common in cats and is easily recognized by most veterinarians.

Symptoms of Horner’s Syndrome in Cats
Horner’s syndrome can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms of Horner’s syndrome in cats may include:


	
	One pupil more constricted than the other
	
	
	Elevated third eyelid on the side with constricted pupil
	
	
	Retraction of the same eyeball into the head
	
	
	Slight drooping of the upper eyelid on the affected side
	


Causes of Horner’s Syndrome in Cats
The sympathetic nerves that control the eye begin in the brain, travel through the brainstem, then down the spinal cord in the neck, and then partway down the spinal cord in the chest. These nerves then course back up the neck (outside the spinal cord) near the middle ear, and then into the eye.

This is a very long nerve path, and damage anywhere along this path can lead to Horner’s syndrome. Examples of potential causes include:


	
	Tumors of the brain, spinal cord, middle ear, or behind the eye
	
	
	Stroke
	
	
	Trauma that pulls on the foreleg, stretching the nerves in the armpit (brachial plexus avulsion)
	



	
	Mass in the chest that damages the sympathetic trunk
	



	
	Middle ear infection
	
	
	Abscess behind the eye
	
	
	Head trauma, including being hit by a car, being bitten, or falling from a significant height
	


In 42% of cases, Horner’s syndrome occurs with no known cause (referred to as “idiopathic”). Any breed of cat can develop Horner’s syndrome.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Horner’s Syndrome in Cats
Veterinarians diagnose Horner’s syndrome in cats with a physical examination. Once the veterinarian confirms that the cat has Horner’s, their next step is to identify which segment of the nerve pathway is affected. This information is key for prognosis and treatment.

The veterinarian may place a medicated drop in the affected eye. Based on whether the eye dilates, they may be able to narrow down which part of the long sympathetic nerve pathway is affected.

Other diagnostics could include:


	
	Neurologic examination to help localize the lesion (by checking reflexes and responses and watching gait)
	
	
	X-rays of the chest, neck, and skull
	
	
	Ear examination (otoscopic exam) to look for a ruptured eardrum or evidence of a middle ear infection
	
	
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if a brain or spinal cord injury is suspected
	
	
	Computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, neck, or chest
	


Treatment of Horner’s Syndrome in Cats
Horner’s syndrome itself isn’t painful and doesn’t cause blindness. Therefore, the syndrome isn’t usually treated. Instead, the veterinarian treats the underlying cause of Horner’s syndrome if possible.

If the cause of Horner’s is within the brain or along the pathway leading up to the middle ear, it generally carries a less favorable prognosis. For example, tumors may require surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, which does not guarantee resolution of Horner’s syndrome.

If Horner’s syndrome is caused by damage along the pathway from the middle ear to the eye, the prognosis is much more favorable.

For middle ear infections, treatment involves antibiotics. The eardrum may be purposely punctured (myringotomy) to allow the veterinarian to collect a sample for culture. This enables the veterinarian to choose an effective treatment for the specific bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotics are given for six to eight weeks to ensure adequate treatment.

If the middle ear infection isn’t resolving, the veterinarian may recommend removing the ear canal and cleaning out the bony region that houses parts of the middle and inner ear, a procedure known as total ear canal ablation and bulla osteotomy, or TECA-BO. Unfortunately, this surgery can also result in Horner’s syndrome approximately 58% of the time. This is because during surgery there can sometimes be damage to the sympathetic nerves, which can also cause Horner’s syndrome.

Some veterinarians may consider prescribing phenylephrine drops for management of the clinical signs. This would work for animals whose nerve damage is between the middle ear and the eye.

Recovery and Management of Horner’s Syndrome in Cats
Idiopathic Horner’s syndrome usually spontaneously resolves on its own anywhere from several weeks to several months after first appearing. Remember that Horner’s syndrome is not painful or life-threatening, and most of these cats will live long lives, even if Horner’s syndrome doesn’t completely resolve. The caveat here is that some underlying causes of Horner’s syndrome, such as brain tumors, carry a poor prognosis.

In cases with a known cause, cats who will improve usually do so within two to six weeks after the inciting incident or after the cause has been treated.

Some cats may have improvement in some of the signs of Horner’s syndrome but won’t have complete resolution. Around 25% of cats who develop Horner’s syndrome after TECA-BO will have the condition permanently.

If your cat’s Horner’s syndrome is caused by a traumatic injury or an ear infection, make sure to speak with your veterinarian about pain management. Be sure to provide a safe and comfortable location for your cat’s recovery.
Horner’s Syndrome in Cats FAQsCan Horner’s syndrome in cats be caused after cleaning their ears?Yes, vigorous cleaning of a cat’s ears can lead to Horner’s syndrome. Accidentally puncturing the eardrum or putting cleaning materials into the ear when the eardrum is ruptured can result in Horner’s syndrome.
What is the most common cause of Horner’s syndrome in cats?Very often the cause is never determined. However, some common known causes include head or neck trauma—such as a car accident, bite wound, or high-rise fall—and ear inflammation or damage from ear cleaning.
Is Horner’s syndrome in cats painful?Horner’s syndrome is not painful, but underlying causes such as an ear infection or trauma can cause pain.

362,Hormone Replacement Poisoning in Cats,"Toxicosis with Hormone Replacement Medidogions in Cats

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used in various forms by many women, including creams, gels, sprays and patches. However, accidental exposure of cats to these hormone replacement products can cause serious illness. Cats are easily poisoned by these products.

Hormone replacement products can also be poisoning to dogs. If you would like to learn how they affect dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms associated with hormone replacement poisoning will vary depending on the sex of the cat.


    Female Cats – Signs      similar to being in heat, including a swollen vulva and bloody discharge      will be present in female cats experiencing HRT toxicity, even if spayed.
    Male Cats – Extreme      attraction to female dogs as well as the possibility of swollen mammary      glands (breasts) and abnormally small penis. In unaltered cats, testicular      atrophy (shrinking of the testicles) may also occur.
    Hair loss may occur in      both male and female cats.


There is also concern that prolonged exposure to HRT products could cause bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia (a severe blood disease) and possibly mammary tumors (breast cancer.)

Causes

Hormone replacement therapies are used in women to replace estrogen and treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, mood swings and bone loss. HRT medications are commonly supplied as creams, gels, sprays or patches. Women are often advised to apply the medication to the wrists, inner elbows, or legs.

Cats typically become exposed by licking the HRT medication from a woman’s skin. They may also be exposed by chewing on or licking discarded patches.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on the appearance of expected clinical signs and known (or suspected) exposure to an HRT product. Estrogen levels can also be measured in the blood to confirm the diagnosis, if necessary.



Treatment

Symptoms are often reversible by eliminating further exposure to the medication. However, symptoms may take months to resolve completely in some cases.

Prevention


    Women should apply hormone replacement therapy products to areas of the body that the cat is not likely to contact.
    When applying HRT products, women should wear gloves. The gloves should be disposed of in a location inaccessible to the cat when finished.
    Used patches and similar items should be discarded out of the cat’s reach."," and Types

363,Hookworms in Cats,"The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy.


What Are Hookworms in Cats?
Hookworms are one type of intestinal parasite that can affect cats and kittens. Their name comes from their hook-like mouth parts that anchor them into the wall of the intestines, allowing them to feed on fluids and blood from their host to get nutrients. These parasites cause damage to the areas of the intestines where they feed, and they can release a blood thinning compound that causes bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract.

Symptoms of Hookworms in Cats
There are several possible symptoms of hookworm infection, including anemia, digested blood in the stool (black tarry stool), weight loss, and poor hair coat quality. Cats can experience blood loss due to hookworm feeding. This can lead to anemia, which is more common in kittens than in adult cats.

Hookworms are very small compared with some other types of intestinal parasites. They are barely visible to the naked eye, so they are not typically seen in stool. Proper fecal testing is needed to diagnose this issue and properly treat it.

Causes of Hookworms in Cats
Cats can get hookworms in many ways, including:


	
	Ingestion: Cats can get hookworms by eating vertebrates, such as rodents, or by eating cockroaches that are carrying hookworm larvae. Kittens can get hookworms through their mother’s milk as well.
	
	
	Larvae (eggs) picked up in the soil: Hookworm larvae hatch and can stay alive in the ground for several weeks or even months. When a cat ingests these immature hookworms—sometimes by licking their feet after walking outside—most larvae move to the intestinal tract and stay there.
	
	
	Larvae burrowing into cat’s skin: Once they burrow through the skin, they migrate to the lungs and trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed.
	


Hookworms are more common in warm, moist environments, as well as environments with overcrowding and poor sanitation.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Hookworms in Cats
When your veterinarian checks your feline friend for hookworms, a stool sample is needed. This can be collected at the clinic, but it is less stressful for your kitty if you bring a sample with you from home. Your veterinarian has fecal collection cups available to help you collect a sample.

Once they have the sample at the clinic, hookworms can be diagnosed via a fecal flotation. This is a test oftentimes performed in the clinic, but it can also be sent out to a reference lab. Fecal flotation involves the stool being mixed in a special solution, sitting for about 10 minutes, and then being examined under the microscope. This leads to diagnosis via microscopic examination of the feces.

Treatment of Hookworms in Cats
Treatment for hookworms is generally safe and inexpensive. There are several potential treatment options for feline hookworms, using the following medications that may be prescribed by your vet:


	
	Ivermectin (Heartgard)
	
	
	Milbemycin oxime (Interceptor)
	
	
	Emodepside (Profender)
	
	
	Selamectin (Revolution Plus)
	
	
	Moxidectin
	


Two treatments of the medication prescribed by your veterinarian, given 2-3 weeks apart, are generally required since the medications will not kill larvae. The second treatment is needed to kill any larvae that transformed into adult parasites during that time.

Recovery and Management of Hookworms in Cats
After the second dose of dewormer, recovery is rather quick and prognosis is good for full recovery from hookworm infection. While your pet is being treated for hookworms, please continue to promptly remove all feces from the litter box or yard and wash your hands after handling feces. During this time, feces can still pass hookworms on to other pets in the environment.

Prevention of Hookworms in Cats

Several measures should be taken to prevent infection or reinfection of hookworms in cats. As kittens, it is ideal for them to be treated with a veterinary-approved and prescribed dewormer by 2-3 weeks of age.

It is important to keep all cats on monthly preventatives, no matter whether they are indoors only, have access to a porch, or have full access to the outdoors. Even with indoor cats, there is a risk of hookworm infection.

Hygiene is a very important factor in hookworm control and prevention. Cat feces should be promptly and appropriately disposed of, and always wash your hands after handling cat feces. It is important to promptly treat any diagnosed worms as soon as they are detected.
Hookworms in Cats FAQsCan indoor cats still get hookworms? Yes. Indoor cats can be exposed to carriers such as rodents or cockroaches. It is also possible for people to track parasites inside on their shoes or belongings.
Can cats transfer hookworms to humans? Yes, via their feces. Children should not be allowed to play in potentially contaminated areas, such as non-covered sandboxes or beaches, since cats can use these areas as their own personal litter box. While feline hookworms may not affect humans internally, they can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans, a migration of hookworms into the skin of humans.

364,Hole in the Trachea in Cats,"Tracheal Perforation in Cats
 
Tracheal perforation is a loss of the integrity of the tracheal wall, in the form of a hole or rip, allowing leakage of air into the surrounding tissues and creating air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum (in between the lungs), and potentially air in the sac around the heart, free air in the chest cavity, and air in the most posterior part of the abdominal cavity (pneumoretroperitoneum). This loss of integrity can be caused by a penetrating trauma, trauma from inside the trachea, or blunt neck or chest trauma.

The severity of tracheal perforation ranges from a small perforation to complete tracheal avulsion (tearing away of the trachea). In cats with complete avulsion, the mediastinal tissues can help to maintain the airways.
 
Symptoms and Types

 The following signs may occur immediately after injury or up to a week later:


    Pockets of air collected under the skin
    Respiratory distress
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Lack of energy
    Gagging
    Excessive salivation (ptyalism)
    Vomiting
    Coughing
    Harsh crowing sound as animal breathes in
    Shock             

 
Causes
 
Penetrating cervical (neck) wounds:


    Bite wounds
    Missiles (e.g., gunshots, arrows)


Perforation by a veterinarian (iatrogenic):


    During a transtracheal wash (a saline wash and collection of tissue and fluid through [trans] the trachea when evaluating for respiratory diseases)
    Inadvertent puncture while drawing blood, or during neck surgery
    Anesthesia and intubation procedures (to maintain an airway during anesthesia)


Blunt trauma can cause intrathoracic tracheal avulsion:


    Motor vehicle accident
    Falling from great heights



 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. An arterial blood gas analysis may also be done to check oxygenation of blood. A pulse oximetry measurement may show less than normal (or even low) oxygen saturation.
 
Side view X-rays of the neck and chest are essential for diagnosis. Air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum, free air in the chest cavity, and potentially air in the sac around the heart will be seen with tracheal perforation. In cases of tracheal avulsion, the site of disruption may be visible. Abdominal X-rays may show a pneumoretroperitoneum -- air that has escaped into the space behind the lining of the stomach (peritoneum). 
 
An examination of the interior walls of the trachea can be done by tracheoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of tracheal perforation and to estimate its severity. False-negative examinations can sometimes occur.
 
Treatment


    Cats with a tracheal perforation should be hospitalized for oxygen therapy  
    It should be kept in a low-stress environment with as little stimuli as is possible  
    In cases of iatrogenic perforation, healing is spontaneous as long as medical and supportive therapy are provided
    If pneumothorax develops, thoracocentesis and even thoracostomy tubes may be indicated
    Surgery is indicated if the patient does not stabilize or decompensates (the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood circulation), or if the tracheal rupture is secondary to a blunt trauma or penetrating wound
    Tracheal cutting and rejoining to another uninjured part of the trachea is indicated in cases of severe tracheal damage or tracheal avulsion 

 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor healing of the surgical incisions if surgery was indicated.  Cats that suffer from an avulsed trachea (one that has been torn away) and do not receive surgery may suffer sudden death. In fact, even with surgery, an animal with a repaired avulsed trachea have a guarded prognosis.

Call your veterinarian immediately if signs of redness, oozing or swelling are noted at the surgical incision site. The veterinarian should also be called immediately, on an emergency basis, if your cat begins to have difficulty breathing."," and Types

365,Hip Dysplasia in Cats,"What is Hip Dysplasia in Cats?
Hip dysplasia is the medical term describing abnormal development of the hip joint. Cats with hip dysplasia have poorly aligned hips that are too loose, which leads to discomfort.

The hip joint is made of a ball and socket. The ball is the round-shaped head of the femur bone in the hip and the socket is the cup-shaped depression in the cat’s pelvis. In cats with hip dysplasia the ball does not sit firmly in the socket, which results in a loose joint. This abnormal hip joint leads to pain and reduced function.

Over time this poor connection leads to early arthritis as the body tries to stabilize the joint and compensate for the abnormality, laying down new bone and bone spurs. Hip dysplasia is a degenerative disease, meaning that it worsens over time. Bony remodeling (where the body removes and builds bone) and arthritis worsens, resulting in greater discomfort and impaired mobility.

Fortunately, hip dysplasia is rarer in cats than in dogs, and many cats with hip dysplasia may never show clinical signs. Researchers suspect this is because cats are better at compensating for hind limb lameness and hiding their pain. It is still important to be aware of the condition, especially if you have a purebred cat. Some purebreds have a higher risk for dysplasia .

Causes of Hip Dysplasia in Cats
Hip dysplasia is an inherited condition, and purebred cats have a higher chance of developing it. Hip dysplasia is more common in the following breeds:


	
	Maine Coon
	
	
	Persian
	
	
	Himalayan
	
	
	Siberian
	


While hip dysplasia in cats is generally considered to be caused by genetics, some underlying factors  can predispose a cat to develop hip dysplasia.


	
	Obesity: Excess weight puts increased force on the hip joint, leading to excessive wear and tear. This can result in degenerative changes accelerating breakdown of the ball and socket.
	
	
	Other orthopedic conditions, like knee problems, can lead to increased stress and breakdown of the hip joint. Injuries can also lead to earlier onset of degenerative changes and accelerate the progression of hip dysplasia.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Hip Dysplasia in Cats
Hip dysplasia is often diagnosed by a combination of a physical exam and X-rays. Your veterinarian will want to palpate, or feel, your cat's hips. They will likely move the hips through a range of motions to see if they move normally.

During this exam, cats with hip dysplasia will often exhibit something called Ortolani sign, which is an abnormal movement of the hip joint when the ball is too loose and comes out of the socket. Sometimes cats can be challenging patients to palpate, especially when they’re in pain. They may be stiff or aggressive when their hips are put through this range of motion. Sedation may be needed to facilitate a thorough physical exam of the hips.

Radiographs (X-rays) are very helpful in diagnosing hip dysplasia. With X-rays your veterinarian will be able to see the shape of the femur and the pelvis and be able to assess any degenerative changes.

Treatment of Hip Dysplasia in Cats
Treatment of hip dysplasia can be challenging in cats. Generally, treatment can include one or more of the following:

Pain Medications and/or joint supplements: Pet parents should never give their cat any human pain medication, which can be very dangerous. For example, acetaminophen is toxic to cats, and can result in death. Your veterinarian may prescribe drugs that are appropriate for cats, like opioid medications.

Many veterinarians will recommend supplements to support joint health. Products like Cosequin or Dasuquin contain glucosamine and chondroitin to support cartilage health. While they will not undo damage in your cat’s hips, they have demonstrated some success at slowing down the progression of degenerative arthritis changes. As with prescribed drugs, supplements must only be given under the direction of a veterinarian, as some supplements can be harmful.

Weight Management: Obesity can speed the breakdown of the hip joint and cause subsequent pain. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most important things you can do for your cat to improve their quality of life.



Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is usually accomplished through a combination of dieting and exercise. Exercise can be very challenging to encourage in cats, and may be discouraged if a cat has a debilitating orthopedic disease. Work with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate amount of food that your cat should receive in a day.

Your vet may suggest changing your cat’s diet to encourage weight loss, through over-the-counter or prescription diet food. Given how finicky some cats can be, monitor your cat’s appetite to ensure they are eating the new diet.

Surgery: While surgery for hip dysplasia treatment in cats is uncommon, surgery may be recommended if the condition seriously impairs a cat’s quality of life. Two of the more common types include femoral head ostectomy (FHO) and a total hip replacement. Both of these surgeries aim to decrease pain by eliminating the grinding and misalignment (called subluxation) in the joint itself.

Recovery and Management of Hip Dysplasia in Cats
While hip dysplasia is uncommon in cats, most cats do well with weight management, joint supplements, and pain control. With medical management, the prognosis is good overall. Hip dysplasia often does not dramatically shorten a patient’s life expectancy unless they are born with genetically severe abnormal conformation in their hips.

Prevention of Hip Dysplasia

Because hip dysplasia is largely inherited, there is not much that a pet parent can do to prevent it in their cat. Avoid breeding cats that have been diagnosed with hip dysplasia. Keep your cat at a healthy weight to minimize excessive force on their joints and earlier onset of arthritic changes in the hip joints.
Hip Dysplasia in Cats FAQsCan a cat live with hip dysplasia?Yes, cats can live good-quality lives with hip dysplasia as long as their pain is controlled.
Is hip dysplasia painful in cats?Yes, it can be painful. Sometimes it is not, however, and is only discovered incidentally on X-rays. Some cats with hip dysplasia never show any clinical signs and are not overtly uncomfortable.

366,High-Rise Syndrome in Cats,"What Is High-Rise Syndrome in Cats? 
High-rise syndrome refers to the common set of injuries that cats get from falling from the second story of a building or higher. These injuries include chest trauma, shock, head and facial injuries, and limb fractures.

The term “high-rise syndrome” was coined by veterinarians in New York City in the 1980s. They noticed an interesting phenomenon—that cats seemed to survive very high falls. These vets noted the same triad of injuries in many of these cats. Overall, these patients had a great survival rate, even with some cats falling as much as 32 stories.

Cats have a special ability that allows them to orient themselves when falling so that they land feet-first. They can rotate and twist their bodies midair to right themselves quickly, then arch their back, like a parachutist, to increase their drag and slow their fall. This is called the “righting reflex.”

Cats that fall from greater than seven stories suffer fewer injuries than those that fall shorter distances. Researchers believe this is because the average-sized cat reaches terminal velocity—meaning they stop speeding up—after seven stories (about 70 feet). Cats can relax their body, so they are less tense when they hit the ground, resulting in less injury.

High-rise syndrome is more common in young cats who are less risk-averse, and during warmer weather when apartment windows are more likely to be open.

While 90% of cats will survive falling from a high-rise building, about a third of those cats won’t survive without veterinary help. There are two big takeaways from this research:


	
	Even if your cat fell from a very high distance (i.e., 30 stories or more), don’t assume the fall is fatal. There is a good chance your cat can survive with veterinary care.
	
	
	If your cat sustained a fall, take them to the nearest veterinary hospital immediately. There are several common injuries that occur in these cats that need to be addressed.
	


Symptoms of High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
Symptoms of high-rise syndrome in cats include:


	
	Difficulty breathing
	



	
	Panting
	
	
	Listlessness
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Cold body temperature
	
	
	Lameness
	
	
	Blood coming from the mouth
	
	
	Broken teeth
	
	
	Facial trauma
	
	
	Limb disfigurement, swelling, or pain
	


Causes of High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
Cats enjoy sitting on windowsills to watch the birds fly by. This can become dangerous if there is no screen in the window. If the cat is startled or falls asleep, they can fall out.

Young cats and kittens are more likely to be curious, active, and adventurous, leading them to push their boundaries. Additionally, they lack the experience with hazards found in older cats and thus make up a larger percentage of high-rise syndrome victims.

How Veterinarians Diagnose High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
High-rise syndrome is diagnosed based on a history of falling from more than two stories. Following a diagnosis of high-rise syndrome, your vet will want to do several tests to find out which internal and external injuries your cat has.

After doing a thorough physical exam, your veterinarian will want to take X-rays.

They may also recommend more imaging, like an ultrasound, to check for possible abdominal bleeding. Bloodwork will typically be recommended.

Treatment of High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
At first, treatment for high-rise syndrome in cats is focused on shock management and stabilization. After the first 24 hours post-trauma, the treatment focus may shift to fixing orthopedic injuries, such as fractures.

About half of the cats who have high-rise syndrome have respiratory distress, with bruising of the lungs (pulmonary contusions) and a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) being common injuries. These cats may need oxygen support and need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) with an oxygen chamber.

Head and face injuries are also very common, with many affected cats having broken teeth, fractures of the hard palate (the bone right above the roof of their mouth), and facial trauma.

If these injuries are bad enough to prevent a cat from eating, a feeding tube may need to be placed temporarily until they heal.

Orthopedic injuries, like broken legs or luxated (out of the joint) hips, shoulders, or elbows are also common.

Any superficial wounds need to be thoroughly cleaned, then the bone injuries are set and bandaged. Orthopedic surgery may be needed.

Recovery and Management of High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
After being discharged from the hospital, watch your cat’s mental activity, food/water intake, and stool/urine output closely.

Cats breathe out of their nose, so panting is generally considered a sign of respiratory distress. If your cat is panting, take them to be seen by the closest emergency vet immediately. Sometimes pulmonary contusions (bruising on the lungs) can worsen over 48 hours following trauma.

Managing stress during recovery is important. Allow your cat a comfortable, quiet place to rest where they have easy access to all their resources. A soft food diet may be needed if they had any trauma to the face or teeth.

If your cat had any orthopedic injuries, they will likely be put under strict activity restriction orders. This may require setting them up in a small bathroom or large dog crate to prevent excessive use of the affected limbs. Litter boxes with low entry points or a ramp entry may be helpful for them to get in and out of the box.

Prevention of High-Rise Syndrome in Cats
Thankfully, high-rise syndrome can be prevented by not giving your cat access to open windows.


	
	Keep window screens tightly in place and replace them if they are getting flimsy or have holes or gaps.
	
	
	If you do not have screens, keep your windows shut.
	
	
	Remove any furniture that would allow a cat access to a higher window.
	
	
	Keep balcony doors shut or install screen doors to your balcony.
	
	
	Consider installing a catio to allow your cat a safe place to bird-watch.
	

High-Rise Syndrome in Cats FAQs What bones do cats break with high-rise syndrome?The back legs are more commonly broken than any other bone in a cat’s body. The tibia (shin bone) is broken most, and the femur (thigh bone) is broken second-most often in cats with high-rise syndrome.

367,High Phosphorus in Cats,"What Is High Phosphorus in Cats?
Phosphorus is an essential mineral for your cat’s health. It plays several important roles, including growing, maintaining, and repairing cells and tissues, as well as maintaining vitamin D and calcium levels. Phosphorus is also responsible for regulating protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism.

Most of the phosphorus in a cat’s body is bonded to calcium, forming calcium phosphate, which creates and maintains healthy bones and teeth. The remainder of a cat’s phosphorus circulates in the blood to aid in metabolism.

When a cat’s phosphorus levels are above a normal range (2.5 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL), they have a condition called hyperphosphatemia. High phosphorus in cats is most often caused by kidney disease, but other conditions can also lead to hyperphosphatemia.

High phosphorus levels can result in low calcium levels, which can cause the cat’s body to break down bone to release stored calcium.

If a cat’s phosphorus level has been elevated for months or years, they may experience decreased bone density, which can cause weak bones, bone pain, and fractures. In some cases, hyperphosphatemia can cause calcium to deposit in soft tissues, especially if levels are chronically elevated. This can result in painful calcified lesions on the cat’s paw, as well as calcification in blood vessels, which can lead to cardiovascular disease.

Symptoms of High Phosphorus in Cats 
Symptoms of high phosphorus in cats depend on the underlying cause of your cat’s high phosphorus levels. However, general signs include:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Nausea or vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Tooth loss
	
	
	Muscle tremors
	


Causes of High Phosphorus in Cats
High phosphorus in cats occurs when a cat has too much phosphorus or too little calcium, because these minerals have an inverse relationship. Common causes of high phosphorus in cats include:


	
	Chronic kidney disease (CKD)—Cats with CKD don’t eliminate enough phosphorus, and hyperphosphatemia commonly develops. High phosphorus levels are linked to disease progression and increased fatality rates in cats with CKD. Addressing hyperphosphatemia is important to prevent complications of CKD and to help your cat feel better.
	
	
	Acute kidney injury— Conditions, such as when the bladder is blocked from an obstruction and poison ingestion, can cause acute kidney injury and can lead to high phosphorus levels because the kidneys’ ability to eliminate phosphorus is impaired.
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism—Excess thyroid hormones lead to increased tissue breakdown that releases phosphorus into the bloodstream, causing increased phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Bone cancer—Bone cancer can cause imbalances in phosphorus and calcium levels, leading to hyperphosphatemia.
	
	
	Osteoporosis—When bone breakdown exceeds bone formation, phosphorus is released, contributing to hyperphosphatemia.
	
	
	Diabetes—Diabetic cats can develop hyperphosphatemia, likely because high blood glucose levels pull phosphorus into the bloodstream.
	
	
	Excess vitamin D ingestion—Elevated vitamin D levels cause increased absorption of phosphorus from the intestines as well as increased reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to elevated phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Tumor lysis syndrome—Cancer treatments can cause damaged cancer cells to release phosphorus, leading to hyperphosphatemia.
	


Any cat can develop hyperphosphatemia. However, older cats and those who are overweight are at an increased risk for many conditions, such as CKD and diabetes, that can lead to elevated phosphorus levels.

How Veterinarians Diagnose High Phosphorus in Cats
If your cat is suspected of having hyperphosphatemia, their veterinarian will perform a comprehensive health assessment, which may include:


	
	History—Your veterinarian will ask you to provide a thorough history about any symptoms your cat has been exhibiting, pre-existing health conditions, and if your cat has your cat has swallowed anything poisonous.
	



	
	Physical exam—Your veterinarian will examine your cat from whiskers to tail to check for abnormalities.
	
	
	Screening blood work—A complete blood count (CBC) can help assess your cat’s overall health and a biochemistry profile shows your cat’s phosphorus levels, as well as other helpful parameters such as kidney values and glucose levels.
	
	
	Urinalysis—Your veterinarian may recommend a urinalysis to further evaluate your cat’s health.
	
	
	Thyroid testing—If the cause of your cat’s hyperphosphatemia is not evident, your veterinarian may recommend a thyroid test.
	
	
	X-rays—Your veterinarian may recommend X-rays to check for bone abnormalities or to assess your cat’s kidneys.
	


Treatment of High Phosphorus in Cats 
Treatment for high phosphorus in cats depends on the underlying cause. Potential treatment strategies include:


	
	CKD—CKD has no cure, but the condition can be managed to slow disease progression and improve your cat’s quality of life. Prescription diets that are low in phosphorus are beneficial for cats with CKD. If a prescription kidney diet can’t control your cat’s phosphate levels, your veterinarian may recommend medications that block phosphate absorption from the intestines.
	
	
	Vitamin D toxicity—Treatment for cats affected by vitamin D toxicity includes intravenous (IV) fluids and medications to prevent absorption of vitamin D, and to decrease phosphorus and calcium levels.
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism—Controlling your cat’s hyperthyroidism can help normalize their phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Diabetes—Treating your cat’s diabetes will regulate their blood glucose concentrations, which can help normalize their phosphorus levels.
	


Recovery and Management of High Phosphorus in Cats 
In some cases, such as if your cat has hyperthyroidism or diabetes, controlling your cat’s underlying condition will keep their phosphorus levels in normal range.

Cats with CKD require long-term monitoring and maintenance, and dietary management can take a month or two to normalize phosphorus levels. Your veterinarian will likely recheck your cat’s blood work every four to six weeks.

Prevention of High Phosphorus in Cats
Cat parents can’t prevent every case of high phosphorus. However, to reduce your feline friend’s hyperphosphatemia risk, follow these tips:


	
	Keep your cat at a healthy weight to help reduce their risk for conditions, such as diabetes and CKD, that can lead to elevated phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Store all medications and supplements in a safe location, away from your cat.
	
	
	Schedule regular veterinary visits to monitor your cat’s health, so conditions are detected early when they are easier to treat and manage.

368,High Levels of Blood Nitrogen in Cats,"Azotemia and Uremia in Cats

An excess level of nitrogen-based substances compounds such as urea, creatinine, and other body waste compounds in the blood is defined as azotemia. It can be caused by higher than normal production of nitrogen-containing substances (with high protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding), improper filtration in the kidneys (kidney disease), or reabsorption of urine back to bloodstream.

Uremia, meanwhile, also leads to an accumulation of waste products in the blood, but is due to improper excretion of the waste products through the urine because of abnormal kidney function.

Symptoms and Types


    Weakness
    Fatigue
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Depression
    Dehydration
    Constipation
    Weight loss (cachexia)
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Bad breath (halitosis)
    Muscle wasting
    Hypothermia
    Poor haircoat
    Unnatural lack of color in the skin
    A minute red or purple spot on the surface of the skin as the result of tiny hemorrhages of blood vessels in the skin (petechiae)
    The escape of blood from ruptured blood vessels into the surrounding tissue to form a purple or black-and-blue spot on the skin (ecchymoses)


Causes


    Low blood volume or blood pressure
    Infections
    Fever
    Trauma (e.g., burns)
    Corticosteroid toxicity
    High protein diet
    Gastrointestinal bleeding
    Acute or chronic kidney disease
    Urinary obstruction


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). The CBC results may confirm nonregenerative anemia, which is common in cats with chronic kidney disease and failure. Hemoconcentration may also occur in some cats with azotemia, whereby the blood thickens due to a decrease of fluid content.

Along with identifying abnormally high concentrations of urea, creatinine, and other nitrogen-based compounds in the blood, a biochemistry test may reveal high levels of potassium in the blood (hyperkalemia). The urinalysis, meanwhile, may reveal changes in urine specific gravity (a urinalysis parameter commonly used in the evaluation of kidney function) and abnormally high concentrations of protein in the urine.

Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound are two other valuable tools often used by veterinarians to diagnose azotemia and uremia. They can help in determining the presence of urinary obstructions and the size and structure of the kidneys -- smaller kidneys are commonly found in cats with chronic kidney disease, while larger kidneys are associated with acute kidney failure or obstruction.

In some cats, a kidney tissue sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis of kidney disease and also to eliminate the possibility of other acute or chronic kidney diseases that may be present.



Treatment

The type of treatment recommended by your veterinarian will depend on the underlying cause of the diseases, though the ultimate goal is to halt the primary disease, whether it be azotemia or uremia. In the case of urinary obstruction(s), for example, your veterinarian will try to relieve the obstruction to allow normal passage of urine. In addition, if the cat is dehydrated, intravenous fluids will be administered to stabilize the animal and rectify electrolyte deficits.

Living and Management

The overall prognosis of this disease depends on the level of kidney damage, acute or chronic states of kidney disease, and treatment.  However, as most drugs are excreted through kidneys, cats with kidney disease or failure require extra care for selection of proper medications to avoid further damage to kidneys. Don’t give any drug to your cat without prior consultation with your veterinarian. Moreover, don’t change the brand or dose of the drug prescribed by your veterinarian without prior consultation.

You’ll need to monitor the urine output of your cat at home and in some patients the owners need to properly record the urine output. This record of urine output will help your veterinarian to determine the progression of the disease and overall performance of kidneys with current therapy. Your veterinarian may repeat the laboratory tests to measure the level urea and creatinine concentrations 24 hours after starting intravenous fluids."," and Types

369,High Cholesterol in Cats,"Hyperlipidemia in Cats



Hyperlipidemia is characterized by abnormally excessive amounts of fat, and/or fatty substances in the blood. Chylomicrons are micro particles of liquid fat, in the class of lipids, which include both triglycerides and cholesterol, and which are formed during the digestion of fats from food. After eating a meal, the nutrients in an animal’s body pass into the small intestine, from which chylomicrons are absorbed 30-60 minutes later. Normally, the absorption of chylomicrons increases serum triglycerides for 3-10 hours, but some animals will have high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels for more than twelve hours after a meal - one of the main indications of hyperlipidemia. The clear part of the blood, the serum, is referred to as being lipemic when it has levels of triglycerides measuring over 200 mg/dL. Sometimes, levels of triglycerides in an animal’s serum can be even greater than 1000 mg/dL, giving the serum a milky, opaque appearance. This is medically referred to as lactescence (literally, being milky).



Certain diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism can decrease the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for dissolving lipids. Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperadrenocorticism can affect the liver in such a way that the liver produces more very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), resulting in increased lipid levels in the blood. Other diseases, like nephrotic syndrome, cause the liver to increase production of cholesterol. Conversely, if the liver itself is diseased, it may not be able to excrete cholesterol at all. Hyperlipidemia can also be the result of an inherited disease in certain breeds of cats.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of hyperlipidemia include seizures, abdominal pain, nervous system dysfunctions, patches on the skin, and cutaneous xanthomata, which are yellowish-orange lipid-filled bumps (i.e., bumps filled with a fatty, greasy liquid).



Causes




	Increased absorption of triglycerides/cholesterol:
	
		After eating, especially after fatty meal
	
	



	Increased production of triglycerides/cholesterol:
	
		Nephrotic syndrome (degenerative kidney disease)
	
	



	Decreased clearance of triglycerides/cholesterol:
	
		Under-functioning thyroid gland
		Over-functioning adrenal gland
		Diabetes mellitus
		Inflammation of the pancreas
		Obstruction of the bile ducts (cholestasis)
	
	



	Pregnancy
	Defects in lipid clearance enzymes, or lipid carrier proteins
	Inherited






Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms, diet, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health. Your pet will most probably need to be hospitalized so that it can be put on a strict fast for twelve hours. After twelve hours or more, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a serum sample for biochemical analysis, and a urinalysis. If triglycerides are greater than 100 mg/dL, and/or if cholesterol is greater than 200 mg/dL, your cat will be diagnosed hyperlipidemic.



The results of the blood work and urinalysis will allow your veterinarian to rule out the various underlying diseases that cause hyperlipidemia. Your veterinarian may also perform further testing for hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism, depending on the blood work results. It may also be relevant to check your pet’s lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.





Treatment



Initially, treatment will begin with changing your cat's existing diet to one which contains less than ten percent fat. If this is not effective, alternative medical treatments may be prescribed at your veterinarian’s discretion.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments so that your cat's serum triglyceride levels can be monitored. This will be for the prevention of possibly fatal bouts of acute pancreatitis as the result of abnormally high levels of fat in the blood.

Like in people, cats’ blood sugar should stay in a specific range to maintain normal body processes. The normal range for a cat’s blood sugar, or blood glucose, is 80 to 120 mg/dL. However, certain situations can lead to high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia, in cats.

The pancreas produces insulin, which is a hormone that helps blood glucose enter the body’s cells so it can be used as energy.

High blood glucose can develop if a cat’s pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate their blood sugar or if the insulin it produces does not effectively reduce blood glucose (i.e., insulin resistance). This condition is called diabetes mellitus. When blood glucose levels get too high, excess glucose will be eliminated in the cat’s urine.

High blood sugar on its own isn’t a medical emergency. However, unresolved feline hyperglycemia can quickly lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

DKA develops when the liver breaks down fat because the body’s cells lack adequate glucose to use as an energy source. Fat breakdown produces chemicals called ketones, which can accumulate in the body and lead to serious, life-threatening illness.

Symptoms of High Blood Sugar in Cats
Symptoms of high blood sugar in cats include:


	
	Excessive water intake
	
	
	Excessive urination
	
	
	Increased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	


Cats who are seriously ill, such as those with diabetic ketoacidosis, usually have more severe clinical signs, including:


	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Causes of High Blood Sugar in Cats 
The leading cause of feline hyperglycemia is diabetes mellitus. One study estimated that approximately 1 in 200 cats has diabetes mellitus. Any cat can develop diabetes mellitus, but it’s most common in cats over 6 years of age.

Cats are usually overweight or obese when they develop diabetes, but then lose weight as the disease progresses. Tonkinese, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Burmese cats are reportedly predisposed to developing diabetes when compared to crossbred cats.

Additional causes of increased blood sugar in cats include:


	
	Anxiety—Stress, reactivity, or fear can increase blood sugar in cats. This commonly occurs during veterinary visits if cats become stressed out or irritable.

	
		
		In this case, the blood sugar is only temporarily elevated and doesn’t reflect true disease.
		
	
	
	
	Cushing’s disease—Cushing’s disease, or hyperadrenocorticism, is an overproduction of cortisol due to a tumor of the pituitary gland or adrenal gland.

	
		
		Cushing’s disease is associated with diabetes mellitus and is more common in dogs than cats.
		
	
	
	
	Acromegaly—Acromegaly occurs in cats who produce excess growth hormone, which is usually due to a tumor in the pituitary gland. This diagnosis should be considered in diabetic cats who continue to gain weight despite good control of the disease.

	
		
		Acromegaly is most common in middle-aged to older male cats, and Maine Coon cats may be predisposed.
		
	
	


Other conditions that may predispose a cat to hyperglycemia include recurrent episodes of pancreatitis and kidney failure (especially acute or sudden failure).

Some medications, such as glucocorticoids (i.e., steroids, such as prednisolone), hormone drugs, and diuretics, increase the risk of hyperglycemia. In cats, this is most commonly associated with the long-term administration of steroids.

How Veterinarians Diagnose High Blood Sugar in Cats 
Your veterinarian can detect high blood sugar with routine blood work during your cat’s annual wellness appointment.

High blood sugar can also be diagnosed using a drop of blood and a glucometer. If your veterinarian suspects diabetes, they may perform this test prior to running full blood work for a faster diagnosis.

Your vet may also perform urine testing, or urinalysis, to see if your cat has glucose in their urine.

To help your veterinarian make a diagnosis, important things to share about your cat include:


	
	Changes in appetite
	
	
	Changes in drinking or urinating habits
	
	
	Any vomiting
	
	
	Changes in weight
	


Treatment of High Blood Sugar in Cats 
Diabetes mellitus is primarily managed with insulin administration and dietary changes. Your veterinarian can teach you how to give your cat insulin injections at home.

There are multiple types of insulin available, and your veterinarian will recommend the type that is best for your cat. Examples include:


	
	Protamine zinc insulin (ProZinc®)
	
	
	Glargine (Lantus®)
	
	
	Detemir (Levemir®)
	

For at-home administration of insulin, you will need insulin syringes and a safe way to dispose of needles. There are two types of insulin syringes: U-100 and U-40. You must ensure you use the right syringe type for the insulin’s concentration, or the dose you give will not be appropriate and could cause dangerously low blood sugar.

New oral treatments may be successful for some cats. For example, Bexacat™ (bexagliflozin tablets) is an insulin-free oral medication for diabetic cats that became available in 2023. This treatment is meant to help improve blood glucose levels in diabetic cats who haven’t been previously treated with insulin.
Your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet to manage your cat’s diabetes. Some possibilities include:


	
	Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets DM Dietetic Management (dry or canned)
	
	
	Royal Canin®/MD Veterinary Diet Glycobalance (dry or canned)
	
	
	Hill’s Prescription Diet m/d GlucoSupport (dry or canned)
	


There are also over-the-counter options that may be appropriate for some cats. With strict dietary management, some cats can go into diabetic remission and will not be dependent on insulin.
There are also over-the-counter options that may be appropriate for some cats. With strict dietary management, some cats can go into diabetic remission and will not be dependent on insulin.

Transient feline hyperglycemia that occurs due to stress or anxiety doesn’t typically need to be treated with medication. However, your veterinarian may recommend ways to reduce stress for future veterinary visits. These may include anti-anxiety medications, like gabapentin, or feline pheromone products.

Recovery and Management of High Blood Sugar in Cats 
Some cats can go into diabetic remission. According to the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), your cat has the best chance of going into remission if you achieve good blood glucose control within six months of diagnosis. Cats who do not achieve diabetic remission will be dependent on medical treatment for the remainder of their life.

Because diabetes causes your cat to urinate more, it’s important that your cat always has access to fresh water and a clean litter box. Cats with diabetes are also more likely to develop urinary tract infections, so contact your veterinarian if you notice your cat straining in the litter box or frequently urinating small amounts, or if you see blood in your cat’s urine.

Control of diabetes requires strict dietary management. This includes providing a well-balanced diet and usual feeding routine, restricting your cat’s access to treats, and not feeding table scraps.

 Prevention of High Blood Sugar in Cats
To help prevent your cat from developing diabetes, keep them at a healthy weight and feed them a healthy diet. Schedule annual wellness exams, including blood work, with your veterinarian, who will assess your cat’s weight and make any recommendations about dietary changes.
High Blood Sugar in Cats FAQsWhat happens when a cat’s blood sugar is too high? If a cat’s high blood sugar is not controlled, they can develop a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA occurs when the liver breaks down fat for energy, which leads to the accumulation of ketones in the blood.
How can I help my cat with high blood sugar? Work with your veterinarian to develop a safe treatment plan for your cat. Always provide access to water, and restrict access to treats and table scraps.
What is the life expectancy of a diabetic cat? Survival times vary widely, but well-managed diabetic cats can live for several years. One study reported a median survival time approaching one and a half years. Another study reported that almost two-thirds of cats survived more than one year, approximately one-fourth survived more than three years, and around 10% survived for more than five years after diagnosis.
What is a dangerously high blood sugar for a cat?A blood glucose over 250 to 300 mg/dL is considered dangerously high in cats. If you have a diabetic cat with blood glucose levels over 300 mg/dL despite treatment, contact your veterinarian.

371,High Blood Pressure in the Portal Vein to the Liver in Cats,"Portal Hypertension in Cats

When ingested food enters into the intestinal tract, the nutrients and toxins that are a part of the food that has been ingested are released into the digestive blood stream. Before this blood can flow into the systemic blood stream, it must first go through a filtering and detoxification process. The filtering process is carried out mainly by the liver, which detoxifies the blood and sends it out into the main circulatory system. The portal vein, the main part of the hepatic portal system, carries this deoxygenated, prefiltered blood from the digestive tract and its related organs (i.e., the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder) to the liver for processing.  When blood pressure in the portal vein reaches a level that is greater than 13 H2O, or 10 mm Hg, this is referred to as portal hypertension. The two main causes of portal hypertension are increased portal flow, or increased resistance to blood.

Increased portal flow occurs when the portal veins attach to arteries, as they do in an arteriovenous fistula (where a new passage is formed between a vein and an artery), or it can occur as a result of blood being diverted (shunted) from the arteries to the liver.  Increased resistance to blood can occur in the portal vein prior to its entry into the liver (prehepatic); in the portal vein inside the liver (hepatic); or, it can occur in the hepatic veins in the inferior vena cava (the largest vein in the body, which feeds blood from the lower body to the heart), after blood has exited the liver (posthepatic).

Whether due to increased portal blood flow, or to increased resistance to blood, portal hypertension can cause the formation of multiple portosystemic shunts (PSS), a condition in which the circulatory system bypasses the liver. Cats with portal hypertension can also develop increased abdominal lymph production, leading to fluid build-up in the abdomen. Even more critical is the development of hepatic encephalopathy, which manifests as seizures and problems with mobility due to the unfiltered toxins being delivered to the brain through the bloodstream.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.

Other important tests that your veterinarian will order are tests for total serum bile acids, blood ammonia levels, and a sampling of abdominal fluids. Testing the abdominal fluid is essential for determining where the cause of the portal hypertension is originating.

Internal imaging will also be a part of the diagnostic procedures. Results of chest x-rays may show that it is a heart disorder causing the portal hypertension, while abdominal x-rays will allow for a more exact examination of the spleen and liver. An abdominal ultrasound is invaluable for diagnosing disease. In addition, an echocardiogram can assist in diagnosing heart disorders, clots (thrombi), or protrusions in the walls of the abdomen (hernia). Your veterinarian can also use a diagnostic technique by which the internal anatomy is illuminated by using an injected radioactive tracer. This technique  is used for a colorectal scintigraphy, where the colon is examined for abnormalities, and for a portovenography, which allows for examination of the portal system, and which can confirm whether there is a portosystemic shunt (PSS) – i.e., a diversion of blood flow. In simple terms, the radiopaque injection (tracer) will allow your doctor to visually examine the blood flow, and see whether the blood is passing through the liver to be filtered and detoxified, or whether the blood is being shunted – diverted – around the liver, creating a toxic condition for the entire system. Angiography, another imaging process using this technique, will allow your doctor to confirm  possible abnormal openings and passages (arteriovenous fistulae) in your cat's liver by visually tracing blood flow through the arteries and veins. A sample of tissue may also need to be taken from the liver (liver biopsy), if liver disease is suspected.

Treatment


Your cat will probably be hospitalized for monitoring and for fluid therapy, since dehydration and fluid retention are causes for concern. Your cat's system will need to be detoxed to prevent critical damage to the brain and system.

Surgery may be necessary, but it is dependent on the underlying cause of the disease. If your cat has abdominal fluid build-up, your veterinarian will also prescribe diuretic drugs to treat this.

Living and Management

After your cat has been discharged from care, you will need to restrict its activity until the abdominal swelling has resolved. Dietary changes may be in order, but you will need to consult with your veterinarian before making any major changes to your cat's meals. For example, if your cat is suffering from abdominal distention, it may need to be on a low salt diet to mitigate the fluid retention, but if your veterinarian wants your cat to have more fluid intake with increased urination so that the system will clear, dietary indications will be different. If your cat is diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, your doctor will likely recommend a low protein diet, until the liver is at full functioning ability, but again, do not make these changes unless they are recommended by your doctor. Your veterinarian will plan follow-up care based on the underlying disease."," and Types

372,High Blood Pressure in the Lungs in Cats,"Pulmonary Hypertension in Cats



Pulmonary hypertension in cats occurs when pulmonary arteries/capillaries vasoconstrict (narrow), are obstructed, or receive excessive blood flow. Where pulmonary refers to the lungs and their immediate environs. The capillaries of the lungs are very tiny branches of blood vessels only one cell in thickness, connecting the smallest veins to the smallest arteries for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to the blood and tissues. Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, so high blood pressure in the left atrium of the heart can also cause elevated pressure in the capillaries of the lungs.



High pulmonary blood pressure is dangerous because it can alter the shape and performance of the heart. The right ventricle is enlarged, while the left ventricle fills abnormally. Less oxygenated blood reaches the body, leading to troubled breathing, exercise intolerance, and blue-purple tinged skin. Eventually, this increased blood pressure in the right heart can lead to the pooling of blood in the body. The tricuspid valve can also be affected. Located in the right side of the heart, separating the right atrium (upper chamber) from the right ventricle (lower chamber), the tricuspid valve consists of three flaps of tissue that prevent blood from flowing back into the atrium from the ventricle. High pulmonary blood pressure can bring about abnormal functioning of the tricuspid valves, causing a back-flow of blood from the right ventricle back into the right atrium, eventually leading to right-sided congestive heart failure.



Pulmonary hypertension in humans is typically due to an abnormal congenitally formed arrangement of the blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary vasculature), but with cats, the current medical findings show that they only develop secondary pulmonary hypertension, that is, hypertension in the lungs due to an underlying disease.



Symptoms and Types




	Exercise intolerance
	Trouble breathing
	Bluish-purplish tinged skin
	Coughing
	Coughing or vomiting up blood
	Enlarged abdomen
	Weight Loss
	Fatigue
	Fainting




Causes



Pulmonary (lung) disease 


	Vascular (blood vessel) blockage
	Pneumonia
	Bronchitis
	Cancer
	Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	Thrombosis (blood clot blocking the blood vessels in the lung)




Extrapulmonary causes of chronic hypoxia (inadequate levels of oxygen reaching the lung tissues)


	Overactive adrenal glands
	Protein-losing nephropathy (a kidney disease where proteins normally kept by the body are lost in the urine)
	Inflammation of the pancreas
	Heart disease
	Heartworm disease
	High altitude disease
	Cancer
	Infection
	Not breathing enough (due to paralysis, etc.)
	Obesity








Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. In order to find the underlying cause for the pulmonary disorder, your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) test, to measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as to measure the capability of the lungs to move oxygen into the blood. If there is any fluid that has escaped from the vessels into the lining of the lungs (pleura) or abdomen (referred to as effusion), your veterinarian will take a sample for laboratory analysis. If a blood clot in the lung is suspected (pulmonary thrombosis), your veterinarian may perform several more blood tests to confirm this.



A comprehensive examination of the thorax, the cavity where the lungs reside, is essential for diagnosis. Thoracic radiography, or x-ray imaging, is an essential diagnostic tool for your veterinarian to visualize pulmonary abnormalities and/or heart disease. Likewise, an echocardiogram (using Doppler) is a more sensitive tool for finding heart abnormalities, pulmonary blood clots, and measuring pressure gradients in blood vessels when the heart is contracting. Your veterinarian may also use an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) to evaluate the electrical functioning of the heart. Recordings from this test would allow your doctor to make a diagnosis based on any observed abnormalities, if they exist, indicating lack of oxygen to the heart muscle.





Treatment



If your cat is showing signs of severe breathing problems it will be hospitalized and placed in an oxygen cage until its breathing has stabilized. Medicines will be prescribed by your veterinarian in accordance with the underlying disease diagnosis. If the finding is severe heartworm infestation, surgery may be performed to resolve the condition.



Living and Management



Many times the prognosis for secondary pulmonary hypertension is guarded at best. If the disease cannot be resolved, treatment can serve to make your cat more comfortable, but it is not curative. If heart failure is diagnosed, your veterinarian will probably prescribe a restricted sodium diet for your cat. Otherwise, to encourage the best conditions for your cat, try to avoid environments that may place undue physical pressure on the cat, such as excessively cold or dry air, excessive heat, second-hand smoke, and high altitudes."," and Types

373,High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) in Cats,"What Is Hypertension in Cats?
Hypertension in cats describes high blood pressure that is present throughout the entire body.

When a cat’s heart contracts, it pushes blood throughout the body and creates pressure on the walls of the arteries. This pressure is called systolic blood pressure (SBP). When the heart relaxes and fills with blood, the pressure on the artery walls is called diastolic blood pressure (DBP). So blood pressure is a measurement of the amount of pressure on the artery walls.

A cat’s blood pressure is measured in the same way as a human’s, with the systolic number over the diastolic number, measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. A human’s normal blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg.

In cats, the diastolic blood pressure measurement, or the bottom number, is less reliable and considered a less important component of hypertension. So hypertension in cats is typically diagnosed on the basis of an elevated systolic blood pressure, or top number.1

Feline hypertension is generally diagnosed when the SBP is greater than 160 mm Hg or if the SBP is greater than 150 mmHg and there is clear evidence of organ damage due to hypertension.

Symptoms of High Blood Pressure in Cats
Early signs of high blood pressure in cats are often not noticeable to pet parents and may only be detected by routine blood pressure measurement.

Unfortunately, if cats are not routinely screened for high blood pressure or common diseases that cause high blood pressure, they will only show noticeable symptoms once significant damage has already been done to their organs. The organs that are damaged by hypertension in cats are the eyes, brain, nervous system, kidneys, and heart.

Usually, a pet parent will first notice something wrong with their cat’s eyes, and this is what will prompt them to seek veterinary attention. Symptoms include:


	
	Fixed, dilated pupils
	
	
	Blood in the globe (clear chamber) of the eye
	
	
	Bumping into objects
	
	
	Sudden blindness
	


Blindness and dilation of the pupils are often due to retinal detachment. Unless hypertension in cats is treated very promptly and aggressively, vision loss is often permanent.

Symptoms of brain damage due to feline hypertension include:


	
	Abnormal behavior
	
	
	Disorientation
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Seizures
	


Signs of kidney damage that may be worsened with hypertension include:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Increased water intake
	
	
	Frequent urination
	


Signs of heart disease due to hypertension include:


	
	Abnormal heart sounds or murmurs found during a veterinary examination
	
	
	Less likely: Rapid, shallow breathing, paralysis, or sudden death due to congestive heart failure
	


Causes of High Blood Pressure in Cats
In 80% of cases, high blood pressure in cats is due to or associated with an underlying disease. This is called secondary hypertension. These are the two most common underlying conditions:


	
	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common disease associated with hypertension in cats and is found in up to 74% of cats with hypertension. 1
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism, a disease caused by a tumor on the thyroid gland (usually benign), is also commonly present in cats with hypertension.
	


Uncommon diseases that are linked to a higher risk of feline hypertension include hyperaldosteronism, hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease), diabetes mellitus, and pheochromocytoma. These diseases are diagnosed most frequently in senior and geriatric cats. Certain medications such as steroids and phenylpropanolamine may also lead to high blood pressure in cats.

About 20% of cats have idiopathic hypertension, meaning that an underlying cause is unable to be found. A portion of these cats are likely in the very early stages of chronic kidney disease, before laboratory abnormalities can be detected. 1  

How Vets Diagnose Hypertension in Cats
Veterinary teams measure blood pressure in cats in a way that’s similar to measuring a human’s blood pressure. A cuff is placed around your cat’s front leg, back leg, or tail, and then it’s inflated. The vet will use either a doppler or oscillometric blood pressure device to take the readings.

Cats can easily become scared at the vet’s office and experience “white coat syndrome,” which can lead to stress-related hypertension. To avoid getting a false diagnosis of hypertension due to stress, your veterinarian will likely take your cat’s blood pressure reading in a quiet area and will try to allow your cat to relax prior to taking the measurements.

Typically, at least five readings will be taken during the visit and averaged together. In addition, unless it is obvious that your cat is hypertensive—for example, there are signs consistent with hypertension, such as retinal detachment—your veterinarian will repeat blood pressure measurements on at least two separate occasions before diagnosing hypertension.

Treatment for High Blood Pressure in Cats
As in humans, high blood pressure in cats is treated with oral medications. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is the drug of choice used to treat feline hypertension. It comes in a pill form and is given orally once daily.

If you have a hard time giving pills to your cat, your veterinarian may have the medication compounded into a liquid. The goal of treatment is to minimize the symptoms associated with organ damage due to high blood pressure and to reduce your cat’s blood pressure to less than 150 mmHg.

In some cases, additional medications, such as ACE inhibitors or telmisartan may be necessary.
Aside from using medications to help lower your cat’s blood pressure, your veterinarian will need to run laboratory tests to detect any underlying diseases that contribute to hypertension.

This typically includes a complete blood cell count, chemistry panel, thyroid hormone levels, and urine testing. As stated previously, about 80% of cats with hypertension have an underlying disease, and treating the underlying disease is an important component of managing hypertension and increasing your cat’s life span.

Pet parents do typically notice an improvement in their cat’s demeanor and energy levels after starting therapy for hypertension. However, if your cat had vision loss at the time of diagnosis, it may be a permanent consequence of hypertension.

Since hypertension is often unnoticeable until it has been present long enough to cause significant organ damage, the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) recommends routine blood pressure screening for cats as follows:1


	
	Healthy senior cats (7-10 years of age): every 12 months
	
	
	Healthy geriatric cats (11+ years of age): every 6-12 months
	
	
	Cats with CKD, hypertension, or other diseases that increase the risk of hypertension, as well as those with signs of hypertensive organ damage: At time of diagnosis, and then every 3-6 months
	

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) in Cats FAQsWhat is a normal blood pressure for cats?Only the top number, or the systolic blood pressure (SBP), is considered in determining normal or high blood pressure in cats. This number should be less than 150 mmHg.
What is considered high blood pressure for cats?Only the top number, or the systolic blood pressure (SBP), is used in determining high blood pressure in cats. Hypertension in cats is marked by a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg.
Can high blood pressure cause seizures in older cats?Yes, hypertension can cause seizures in older cats.
Can stress cause high blood pressure in cats?Yes, stress can definitely cause hypertension in cats, especially stress caused by being at the vet’s office. This is why your vet will try to allow your cat to relax before taking a reading, and they should do several readings and average them together.

The organs that are damaged by hypertension in cats are the eyes, brain, nervous system, kidneys, and heart.

Usually, a pet parent will first notice something wrong with their cat’s eyes, and this is what will prompt them to seek veterinary attention. Symptoms include:


	
	Fixed, dilated pupils
	
	
	Blood in the globe (clear chamber) of the eye
	
	
	Bumping into objects
	
	
	Sudden blindness
	


Blindness and dilation of the pupils are often due to retinal detachment. Unless hypertension in cats is treated very promptly and aggressively, vision loss is often permanent.

Symptoms of brain damage due to feline hypertension include:


	
	Abnormal behavior
	
	
	Disorientation
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Seizures
	


Signs of kidney damage that may be worsened with hypertension include:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Increased water intake
	
	
	Frequent urination
	


Signs of heart disease due to hypertension include:


	
	Abnormal heart sounds or murmurs found during a veterinary examination
	
	
	Less likely: Rapid, shallow breathing, paralysis, or sudden death due to congestive heart failure

374,Hernia (Inguinal) in Cats,"Inguinal Hernia in Cats



An inguinal hernia is a condition in which the abdominal contents protrude through the inguinal canal or inguinal ring, an opening which occurs in the muscle wall in the groin area.



Inguinal hernia can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of hernia affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Inguinal hernias may be uncomplicated or complicated. A complicated hernia is one in which contents of the abdominal cavity have passed through the opening and become entrapped.



Symptoms seen with an uncomplicated inguinal hernia are:




	A soft swelling in the groin area, which may occur on one or both sides of the body




Symptoms seen with a complicated inguinal hernia may include:




	Swelling in the groin area, which may become painful and warm to the touch
	Vomiting
	Pain
	Frequent attempts to urinate
	Bloody urine
	Lack of appetite
	Depression




Causes



In cats, inguinal hernias are usually traumatic in origin.



Most are uncomplicated and cause no symptoms other than a swelling in the groin area. However, if contents from the abdominal cavity (such as the bladder, a loop of intestines or the uterus) pass through the opening and become entrapped there, the situation can become life-threatening.



Diagnosis



Inguinal hernias can usually be diagnosed by finding the swelling caused by the hernia on a physical examination. However, sometimes contrast radiographs (x-rays) or an abdominal ultrasound are needed to determine which abdominal contents, if any, are entrapped.







Treatment



Treatment is surgical correction of the opening and replacement of abdominal contents back into the abdomen if necessary."," and Types

"
375,Hernia (Hiatal) in Cats,"Hiatal Hernia in Cats



A hernia occurs when one part of the body protrudes through a gap or opening into another part of the body. For example, a hiatal hernia takes place at the opening of the diaphragm where the food pipe joins the stomach. Part of the stomach pushes through the opening, and a hernia is formed. It is most likely to occur before a kitten has reached the first year, and is usually inherited (congenital). However, trauma may bring on an acquired hiatal hernia, and this can occur at any age.



Symptoms




	Anorexia
	Regurgitation
	Coughing
	Vomiting
	Weight loss
	Excessive salivation
	Shortness of breath




Causes




	Congenital
	Acquired - secondary to trauma or an increased effort to inhale
	Concurrent — the lower esophageal sphincter slides into the thoracic cavity and allows gastric reflux into the esophagus, causing inflammation of the esophagus




Diagnosis



X-rays may show soft-tissue density in the region of the esophageal opening (hiatus), but they may not reveal lesions. However, an enlarged esophagus can be detected by X-ray. Contrast exams can show the esophagus as it is joined to the stomach and may reveal any abnormalities that are causing the problems. An exam called the esophagoscopy will use a scope to detect inflammation and might possibly show the end (terminal) of the esophagus sliding into the thorax.



Diagnosis of hiatal hernia is based on examination and observation of one or more of the following manifestations of the condition:




	Foreign body in the esophagus
	Abnormal tissue growth in the esophagus
	Inflammation of the esophagus
	Enlargement of the lower esophagus
	The protrusion of the stomach into the esophagus
	A foreign body in the digestive tract
	Abnormal tissue growth in the stomach
	Inflammation of the stomach










Treatment



Not all hiatal hernias require treatment. Conservative therapy may be successful in controlling symptoms, and feeding small but frequent portions of a low-fat diet may control symptoms. Your veterinarian can prescribe drugs that will promote digestion and increase the tone of the sphincter in the lower esophagus. Medications such as cimetidine will decrease the acidity of the reflux, and promote healing of the damaged esophageal tissue. However, surgical treatment will be necessary if your surgeon finds that your cat needs the opening (hiatus) to be closed, or to have its stomach attached to the abdominal wall so that it does not protrude further. If your cat develops aspiration pneumonia, antibiotics may be necessary, as well as other kinds of therapeutic breathing treatments.



Living and Management



If your cat requires surgery, you will need to follow through with return visits to your veterinarian for after care treatment. This is also true if you are managing the hiatal hernia from home. Aspiration pneumonia is one of the possible long term complications related to a hiatal hernia, so you will need to be watchful for signs of this. If you do detect symptoms of pneumonia, you will need to take your cat to the veterinarian immediately for treatment, as complications can quickly progress, possibly with a fatal outcome. Even with prompt treatment, some cats may have a recurrence of all of the symptoms, forcing you and your doctor to return to square one so that other causes can be settled upon and a treatment plan put into place.

376,Hernia Between the Pericardium and Peritoneum in Cats,"Peritoneopericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia in Cats
 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia is a congenital defect that affects the communication between the peritoneum (membrane that forms the lining of abdominal cavity) and pericardium (double-wall sac containing the heart). Like other hernias, the protrusion of the septum affects the surrounding area -- in this case, the abdomen.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms will largely depend on the amount on the amount and nature of abdominal contents herniated. Some common ones include:
 

    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Cough
    Weight loss
    Difficult breathing

 
Causes
 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia occurs at the embryologic stage, and is considered a prenatal defect.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal.

 
Abnormalities visible on X-rays ultimately depend on size and amount of herniated abdominal contents. More advanced techniques, like contrast peritoneography, are also used for a more detailed evaluation, whereby contrast medium (chemical) is given by injection into the peritoneal cavity and then X-rayed at different angles. Another technique commonly employed for confirmation of diagnosis is echocardiography.


 


Treatment
 
Surgery is typically required to close the hernia and place the viable organs to their normal location. However, if found in adult cats displaying no adverse symptoms, no treatment is required.
 
Living and Management
 
Prognosis is good for cats that have undergone surgery with no other complicating factors."," and Types

377,"Hereditary, Non-Inflammatory Muscular Disease in Cats","Non-inflammatory Myopathy—Hereditary X-Linked Muscular Dystrophy in Cats

Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited, progressive, and non-inflammatory degenerative muscular disease caused by a deficiency of dystrophyin, a muscle-membrane protein. This generalized muscle disorder is primarily seen in newborn cats or those less than one year old. Domestic short-haired and Devon Rex cats are also more prone to this form of muscular dystrophy.

Symptoms and Types


    Vomiting
    Increased muscle mass
    Stiff gait
    Exercise intolerance
    Weakness
    Downward flexion of head and neck


Causes

Dystrophin deficiency due to inherited defect.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Creatine kinase enzyme levels may be elevated due to the dystrophin deficiency. Liver enzymes are also elevated in cats with this disorder.

The most hopeful test for reaching a definitive diagnosis, however, involves taking a muscle biopsy. The muscle tissue sample is sent to a veterinary pathologist to verify abnormal levels of dystrophin.



Treatment

No treatment is proven to be effective. Glucocorticosteriods are often given to cats suffering from non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy, but their effectiveness is variable and their exact mode of action in this disease is still unknown.

Living and Management

Cats with this disorder are prone to aspiration pneumonia or cardiac disease and must evaluated at regular intervals for such complications. Be vigilant of complications and contact your veterinarian should problems arise.

Unfortunately, the overall prognosis is very poor in cats with non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy. Often, your veterinarian will discourage breeding the animal, due to the genetic nature of the disorder."," and Types

378,Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats (Fatty Liver Disease),"What Is Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats?
Hepatic lipidosis is a common cause of liver failure in cats. Any cat can develop the condition, but it is most commonly seen in middle-aged cats who are (or were) overweight and haven’t been eating much recently.

When cats don’t eat, they can lose weight quickly. As a result, large amounts of fat get sent to the liver and end up inside liver cells—sometimes so much fat that the cells can no longer function normally. This is hepatic lipidosis, which is sometimes also called fatty liver disease.

When cats stop eating, hepatic lipidosis can start developing within just a few days. Don’t let your cat go without food for more than a day or two before you call your veterinarian for advice.

Aggressive treatment is usually needed to reverse hepatic lipidosis, but there is good news: As long as they get the treatment they need, as many as 90% of cats with the condition can be expected to survive.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats
Cats with hepatic lipidosis usually have some combination of the following symptoms:


	
	Poor or no appetite
	
	
	Rapid weight loss
	
	
	Jaundice (icterus)—a yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes and other tissues
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy and depression
	
	
	Unusual behaviors
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Diarrhea or constipation
	
	
	Dark urine
	
	
	Abnormal bleeding or bruising
	


Causes of Fatty Liver Disease in Cats
Anything that stops a cat from eating can lead to hepatic lipidosis. Some common causes include:


	
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the wall of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, poor appetite, and weight loss.
	
	
	Cholangiohepatitis and other types of liver disease: Poor appetite, weight loss, and vomiting are common symptoms with almost any type of liver disease.
	
	
	Cancer: Cancer anywhere in the body can trigger cats to eat poorly and lose weight.
	
	
	Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas is painful and often leads to decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
	
	
	Environmental changes: Cats are creatures of habit. Sometimes disrupting their normal routine, such as moving to a new home or adding a new family member, is all that is needed to make them stop eating. Cats that get lost or trapped somewhere without food may also starve and develop hepatic lipidosis.
	


When an underlying cause can’t be identified, a cat will be diagnosed with idiopathic hepatic lipidosis.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats
A veterinarian may suspect that a cat has hepatic lipidosis after learning they haven’t been eating much and they’ve recently lost a lot of weight. A physical exam can also provide evidence, but diagnostic testing is necessary to differentiate hepatic lipidosis from other diseases that have similar clinical signs.

Veterinarians will usually start with a basic panel of bloodwork and a urinalysis. Many cats with hepatic lipidosis will have high levels of bilirubin and very high levels of alkaline phosphatase (a type of liver enzyme) in their blood.

When a cat has hepatic lipidosis, an abdominal ultrasound should reveal that the whole liver looks abnormal, rather than just a specific part. During the ultrasound, the veterinarian can use a needle to remove a small sample of liver cells. If they’re filled with fat, the diagnosis is confirmed.

Additional testing may also be necessary, both to identify hepatic lipidosis and to look for the health problems that may have led to it.

Treatment of Fatty Liver Disease in Cats
At first glance, treatment for hepatic lipidosis seems simple. Get the cat to eat! But in reality, this is much harder than it sounds. Poor liver function makes a cat feel really bad. As a result, they don’t eat, which makes their liver function even worse … and so the cycle continues.

Force-feeding a cat who is nauseated usually backfires. They tend to “blame” the food for how bad they feel and can quickly develop an aversion to eating anything at all. Because we need to get food into a cat with hepatic lipidosis quickly, a feeding tube is usually the best option.

Nasogastric tubes (small tubes placed through the nose into the stomach) can work for a few days, but many cats with hepatic lipidosis require a month or two of tube-feeding. A better long-term solution is an esophagostomy tube. A veterinarian will briefly anesthetize your cat and place the tube into the esophagus through an incision through the skin of your cat’s neck. The tube is then sutured in place so that pet parents can use it for long-term feeding. Other types of feeding tubes may also be considered, based on the specifics of the case.

Next, cats need to be gradually reintroduced to food. Giving too much food too quickly can lead to refeeding syndrome—a potentially fatal shift of fluids and electrolytes within the body. A schedule to prevent refeeding syndrome often looks something like this:


	
	Day 1 – feed 25% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals
	
	
	Day 2 – feed 50% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals
	
	
	Day 3 – feed 75% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals
	
	
	Day 4 – feed 100% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals
	


Cats with hepatic lipidosis may also require treatment with B vitamins, vitamin K, and vitamin E. Fluid therapy with added magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium may be necessary as well.

To support the liver, veterinarians often prescribe nutritional supplements and medications like S-adenosylmethionine, L-carnitine, milk thistle, silybin, and ursodiol. Additional treatments will be based on a cat’s symptoms and underlying health problems.

Recovery and Management for Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats
Cats will usually be hospitalized at the beginning of treatment so that veterinary staff can closely monitor their condition and adjust their treatment as needed. But once they are stable, cats can continue their recovery at home. If your cat has a feeding tube, your veterinarian will provide you with all the training you need to feed your cat, give medications, and maintain the tube.

Tube feedings typically continue for a month or two. Once a cat is no longer nauseated and has started regaining weight, it’s time to start offering them food by mouth. Your veterinarian will likely recommend gradually reducing the amount of food you provide through the tube to give your cat a chance to get hungry. The feeding tube can be removed once a cat is eating completely on their own.

Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your cat’s health or treatment plan. A full recovery from hepatic lipidosis is definitely possible, so don’t give up even if it takes a while.
Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats (Fatty Liver Disease)What is the survival rate for cats with hepatic lipidosis?The prognosis for a cat with hepatic lipidosis depends on the treatment they receive and any underlying health problems they might have. With aggressive treatment, the survival rate for cats with hepatic lipidosis can reach 90%, but this may be lower if hepatic lipidosis is caused by another disease that is difficult to treat.
What should you feed a cat with liver problems?Cats with hepatic lipidosis are often prescribed canned foods that are high in protein and low in carbohydrates. Diets that are designed to help cats recover from serious illness, like Hill’s prescription diet a/d, or that manage diabetes, like Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets DM, often work well for hepatic lipidosis, but other liver problems may respond better to different diets. A veterinarian who is familiar with your cat’s case can help you pick out several good options.
What causes high liver enzymes in cats?Any condition that damages a cat’s liver cells (hepatocytes) can lead to high liver enzymes on a panel of bloodwork. Possibilities include hepatic lipidosis, cholangiohepatitis, cancer, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), exposure to certain drugs or toxins, infections, parasites, portosystemic shunts (PSS), trauma, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or congestive heart failure. Sometimes diseases that have nothing to do with the liver can lead to similar changes in bloodwork.

379,Hemorrhage of the Lung in Cats,"Pulmonary Contusions in Cats

Pulmonary contusion, or a hemorrhage of the lung, occurs when the cat's lung is torn and/or crushed during direct trauma to the chest. This then impedes the cat's ability to breath and pass arterial blood to a capillary bed in synchrony. Cats suffering from capillary damage may also develop pulmonary fluid in the lungs, as well as hemorrhage.

Pulmonary contusion occurs in both dogs and cats and there is no specific breed, age, or gender predilection. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types


    Tachypnea
    Coughing up of blood or blood-tinged fluid
    Respiratory distress, or abnormal respiratory effort after a blunt trauma to the chest
    Cyanotic (blue-tinged) or pale mucous membranes


Causes


    Blunt trauma
    Motor vehicle accidents
    Fall from a great height
    Physical abuse (i.e., beating)
    Coagulopathy (coagulation/clotting disorder)


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition.

Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including blood tests, a urinalysis, and chest X-rays. If there are rib fractures, for example, they will show up on X-ray.

Your doctor will also perform coagulation (clotting) tests, and may culture cells from the trachea.

Treatment

Your pet will probably need to be hospitalized so that respiratory function can be supported, and the cardiovascular system can be stabilized. A hospital stay may be recommended so that the cat may be resuscitated quickly if complications should arise.

Your veterinarian will want to look at other organ systems to be sure there are no other internal injuries. Activity will be restricted for a time, and respiratory functions will be carefully monitored for 24 hours after the trauma.

If shock sets in, it may be necessary to administer fluids intravenously to support the cat's cardiovascular function, and in some cases, blood plasma transfusion might also be called for.

Nutritional support will be given by intravenous fluid, if necessary. Prescribed medications, meanwhile, will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of the symptoms.

Living and Management

Initially, your veterinarian will want to frequently monitor respiratory rate and effort, mucous membrane color, heart rate, pulse quality, and lung sounds. There may also be a need for further blood tests and urinalyses, to monitor your cat’s systemic reaction to the trauma."," and Types

380,Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Urine in Cats,"Hemoglobinuria and Myoglobinuria in Cats

Hemoglobin serves to carry oxygen to the tissues, and also carries the pigment that causes the blood to appear red. The destruction of blood cells within the blood vessels frees hemoglobin into the blood plasma (the yellowish colored liquid matter of the blood), where it binds with haptoglobin, a blood plasma protein which functions for the purpose of binding with free hemoglobin in order to prevent loss of iron. However, when all of the haptoglobin is used up, hemoglobin spills over into the blood, binding reversibly to blood proteins, and changing the color of the plasma from a faint yellow to pink. The unbound hemoglobin is then cleared through the kidneys.

Myoglobin serves the same purpose as hemoglobin but is particular to the muscles, and is differentiated by the amount of oxygen and carbon monoxide it delivers to the tissues (more, and less, respectively). Muscle damage releases myoglobin into the blood plasma, but it does not bind to serum proteins. Consequently, plasma color does not change, and the myoglobin is quickly cleared from the blood by the liver and kidneys.

If there is too much hemoglobin and myoglobin in the blood plasma, these proteins will no longer be reabsorbed in the kidneys, and will instead spill over into the urine.

Not only can hemoglobin and myoglobin damage the kidneys, but their presence in the blood indicates low oxygen-carrying capacity, which can result in liver damage, serious illness, and shock, all of which serve to further decrease the amount of oxygen available through the muscles and blood. In addition, the destruction of red blood cells inside the blood vessels, along with severe muscle damage, can bring about disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), an often fatal blood clotting disease.

Symptoms and Types

        Acetaminophen 		(pain reliever)
        Zinc
        Onions
        Snake 		venom
    
    


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities. A complete blood chemical profile will be conducted. This will include a complete blood count, and a test to measure for toxic levels of copper and zinc concentrations. Your doctor will also probably take a blood smear to look for irregularities of the red blood cells, and may also use the ammonium sulfate test to detect hemoglobin or myoglobin presence in the blood.

A urinalysis to look for bilirubin in the urine is another test that will be necessary for pinpointing the exact cause of the condition. Bilirubin is a red-yellow bile pigment that comes from the degradation of the red pigment (heme) in hemoglobin; too much bilirubin cannot be processed by the liver and will spill over into the urine. Excess bilirubin in the blood is also the cause of yellowing of the skin and eyes.

Radiographs and ultrasounds are useful for visualizing the liver in case of copper-associated liver disease, or to reveal swallowed coins or cage bolts/nuts – both common sources of zinc or copper poisoning.

Treatment

Medications prescribed will depend upon your veterinarian’s final diagnosis of what is underlying the symptoms. If the condition is severe, your cat will be hospitalized for stabilization and fluid rehydration.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will advise you on when you will need to return with your cat for follow-up appointments. There may be further need for a blood chemistry profile, a complete blood count, urinalysis, packed cell volume (PCV) test, and an arterial blood gas analysis. Genetic diseases are generally incurable, but can sometimes be managed by taking certain precautions with the animal. For example, neonatal isoerythrolysis, a congenital condition which results in the destruction of red blood cells, can be prevented by not allowing kittens with type A or AB blood to nurse from a type B queen (mother)."," and Types

381,Heatstroke in Cats,"What Is Heatstroke in Cats? 
Heatstroke in cats can occur in several possible scenarios. Most commonly, it happens to cats who are unable to escape extreme heat, such as those left in a hot car, or outdoor cats without adequate shade and access to water. Heatstroke may also occur in cats that exercise strenuously on hot days or expend a lot of energy when they have long episodes of seizures or tremors, or it may occur in flat-faced cats struggling to breathe on warm or humid days.

During a heatstroke, when a cat’s body temperature surpasses 104 F, there is a significant release of inflammation throughout their body. This inflammation sets off a cascade of reactions that affects every major system of the body, causing the breakdown of essential proteins and enzymes. This puts the cat at risk of organ failure and potentially death.

If your cat is experiencing heatstroke, contact a veterinarian immediately.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptomWhat Is the Difference Between Heatstroke and Heat Exhaustion?
Heat exhaustion is an early stage of heatstroke, when the cat’s temperature is approximately 103–104 F. Recognizing the following signs and acting quickly can prevent heatstroke and tissue damage.

During heat exhaustion, a cat may seek a cooler area, such as a tile floor or a shady spot. They may pant, start to drool, develop sweaty paws, drink more, and start to groom themselves to cool off.

If you notice any of these signs, immediately do the following


	
	Move your cat to a cool, air-conditioned area.
	
	
	Place a slightly cool, damp towel on your cat’s back. If your cat allows, place a damp towel under their belly. Rubbing cool water on the paw pads and ears will also help with cooling.
	
	
	Offer your kitty cool water to drink; some cats may like ice cubes.
	
	
	If your cat’s symptoms are not relieved within 15 minutes or your cat’s condition appears to worsen, seek immediate veterinary attention.
	


Heatstroke is the more severe stage, where the cat’s body temperature rises over 104 F. At this point, tissue damage starts to occur, and the cat develops more severe symptoms.

It is important to start brief cooling at home, such as applying cool damp towels and water to the ears and paws, but head directly to a veterinarian for emergency care.

Symptoms of Heatstroke in Cats
To recognize heatstroke in cats, watch for the following symptoms:


	
	Rectal temperature greater than 104 F
	
	
	Disorientation
	
	
	Reddened gums
	
	
	Vomiting and/or diarrhea, which may contain blood
	
	
	Pinpoint spots of bleeding on the skin, whites of the eyes, gums, inside of the ears, and belly
	
	
	Labored breathing, panting, and wheezing
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Collapse, inability to walk or stand up
	


Causes of Heatstroke in Cats
Cats most at risk for heatstroke include:


	
	Outdoor cats, especially on very hot days, very humid days, or when there is little shade or water available
	
	
	Indoor cats let outside into hot temperatures when they are not used to the heat
	
	
	Indoor cats when there is no power or air conditioning in the home
	
	
	Brachycephalic (flat-faced) cats, on any warm day
	
	
	Obese cats
	
	
	Senior cats
	
	
	Kittens 4 months of age or younger
	
	
	Cats with underlying health issues such as kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or mobility issues that hinder their access to water
	
	
	Cats with heart, respiratory, or neurological conditions (such as seizures)
	
	
	Cats inadvertently trapped in a running clothes dryer
	
	
	Cats unintentionally confined in a car (even on mild days, the interior of a car can quickly become dangerously hot)
	

How Veterinarians Diagnose Heatstroke in Cats 
The diagnosis of heatstroke in cats primarily relies on both the cat’s history and a physical examination. A cat with a history of exposure to a high-temperature environment, prolonged seizures or tremors, a flat-faced cat struggling to breathe on a warm day, and having a body temperature above 104 F, with any of the signs of heatstroke, is a strong indicator.

The veterinary team will immediately take blood samples as well as start pulse oximetry to determine the oxygen saturation of the blood and start an ECG to monitor the heart. In most cases, supplementary oxygen will be needed, at least initially. Lab tests are used to check for any major and minor infection in the blood throughout the cat’s stay, including kidney and liver injury.

The team will pay close attention to the cat’s body temperature, because once cooling efforts start, they do not want the body temperature to drop too low.

Treatment of Heatstroke in Cats
The first step in treating a cat with heatstroke is to bring their body temperature back to a more normal range. This is primarily achieved through intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Your vet will pay close attention to how alert the cat is upon arrival for treatment and whether the cat becomes more or less alert as the treatment progresses. Cooling of the ears, feet, and belly with tepid water may also continue in the hospital, depending on the cat’s temperature when they arrive.

Heatstroke patients often experience low blood sugar. The addition of glucose to their IV fluids over several days will prevent seizures or other side effects of low blood sugar. Throughout the hospital stay, lab tests will be used to screen for kidney and liver injury.

Heatstroke can lead to a breakdown of the lining of the blood vessels, causing a greater risk of bleeding. If this occurs, the cat may benefit from one or more transfusions of fresh frozen plasma from a healthy donor cat to replace clotting factors.

Cats that become comatose may have cerebral edema, or brain swelling. This may be treated with mannitol, a diuretic IV medication. Cats with heatstroke are also more susceptible to sepsis (severe infection throughout the entire body), so antibiotics are often used.

Cats that are having difficulty breathing may receive supplementary oxygen by remaining in an oxygen cage. Some cats that are in severe respiratory distress may need to be intubated and ventilated to help them breathe.

Kidney failure from heatstroke is possible. If this is the case, fluid therapy is essential but must be carefully monitored. In either of these cases, the veterinarian may recommend referral to a facility where a ventilator or kidney dialysis is available.

Recovery and Management of Heatstroke in Cats
In mild to moderate cases of heatstroke, cats often make a full recovery by the time they are discharged from the hospital. Medications to take home may include antibiotics such as Clavamox® and gastrointestinal protectants.

Your veterinarian may want to see your cat back in five to 10 days to perform a recheck examination and lab tests to assess organ function, and sooner if your cat experiences vomiting, diarrhea, or disorientation. Your cat will need ample rest once they are home but should recover soon.

In very severe cases of heatstroke, the prognosis is guarded to poor. It is reasonable to ask your veterinarian about the expected long-term care for your cat, as some pets with severe heatstroke may require long-term treatment for kidney failure, heart disease, or neurological problems.

Keep in mind that cats that have had heatstroke are more sensitive to a recurrence of heatstroke in the future. They should be kept indoors and protected from heat.

Prevention of Heatstroke in Cats

To prevent heatstroke in cats, take the following precautions:


	
	On hot days, keep cats indoors where there is air conditioning.
	
	
	Do not let cats out on a catio or into the yard on hot or warm, humid days.
	
	
	Before using your clothes dryer, check for the presence of a cat to prevent accidental entrapment.
	
	
	Place a bag or purse on or next to the cat carrier to ensure you don’t accidentally leave your cat in the car.
	
	
	Install a Wi-Fi thermostat in your home to receive alerts if the power goes out, so you can get your cat to a cooler place if you are not home.
	
	
	Make sure outdoor cats have plenty of shade and access to water.
	
	
	Give cats with seizures their medications regularly, as missed doses can trigger episodes.
	

Heatstroke in Cats FAQs Can cats get heatstroke? Yes, cats can suffer from heatstroke, especially when they cannot escape the heat. Cats with underlying medical conditions, obesity, flat-faced breeds, and very young or older cats are most susceptible to heatstroke.
What are the signs of heatstroke in cats? Signs of heatstroke in cats include drooling, panting, seeking a cooler spot, disorientation, red gums, vomiting and/or diarrhea, pinpoint spots of bleeding on the skin, heavy breathing, seizures, and collapse. If any of these signs are observed, it is crucial to cool your cat with a towel soaked in cool water on their back and belly, and then seek immediate veterinary care.

382,Heartworm Disease in Cats,"What Is Heartworm Disease in Cats?
Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, which is spread by mosquitos. While cats are susceptible to heartworm, they are fairly resistant, imperfect hosts. Cats acquire heartworm far less than dogs in the same geographic location, with only 5–20% affected. 



Only around 25% of heartworms reach adulthood in cats. Cats also typically have a low worm burden (usually one to four worms), and less than 20% of those worms will produce microfilaria, the infective form of heartworm. Cats also have higher rates of aberrant heartworm migration, which occurs when heartworms fail to migrate to the pulmonary arteries and instead travel to other body cavities, blood vessels, or the central nervous system. 

The life cycle of heartworms is complex and involves many larval, or immature, phases: 


	
	First, a mosquito acquires microfilaria when it bites a dog infected with heartworm disease.  
	



	
	Once ingested by a mosquito, the microfilaria will molt, or transform, over the next 10-14 days into three different forms of larva: L1, L2, and L3.  
	



	
	After the third molt, the L3 larva can now infect new dogs and cats. 
	



	
	The mosquito bites a cat and transfers the infective L3 through saliva into the bite wound. 
	



	
	The L3 stays within the cat’s tissues for 3-4 days until it molts again to L4. 
	



	
	L4 remains in the tissues for approximately 2 months. 
	



	
	Finally, L4 molts to L5, the immature adult, which leaves the tissues via the bloodstream.  
	



	
	L5 lands in the pulmonary arteries—the vessels responsible for bringing oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to re-oxygenate.  
	



	
	L5 continues to develop in the pulmonary artery for another 4-6 months until, finally, it becomes an adult heartworm. The adult is capable, in some worms, of releasing microfilaria into the bloodstream to start the cycle all over again. 
	


The American Heartworm Society divides heartworm disease in cats into two stages: 


	
	Stage 1 occurs when immature L5 worms arrive in the pulmonary arteries, many of them dying. This causes a severe, acute inflammatory reaction (often misdiagnosed as asthma or other respiratory diseases) as the vessels and heart respond to the parasite. Veterinarians and researchers call this acute inflammatory process heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD). As the living worms mature, the inflammatory response lessens, in part from the adult worms actively suppressing the immune system. 
	
	
	Stage 2 occurs when adult heartworms die, invoking a highly inflammatory, anaphylactic, and often fatal response. The dead worms start off a strong pulmonary inflammatory cascade, and a cat’s blood vessels are small and narrow. When an adult heartworm dies, it easily causes an embolism. A cat who survives adult heartworm death will have permanent lung damage and chronic respiratory disease.

Symptoms of Heartworm Disease in Cats 
Clinical signs of heartworm disease vary greatly in severity. Some cats may not have any clinical signs at all. Most of the noticeable issues come from the adult heartworm suddenly dying and causing acute issues within the cat or abnormal worm migration causing tissue damage. When cats do show signs of illness, veterinarians most commonly see the following:  


	
	Lethargy 
	
	
	Coughing 
	
	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Weight loss 
	
	
	Exercise intolerance 
	



	
	Vomiting 
	
	
	Difficulty breathing 
	
	
	Increased breathing 
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing 
	
	
	Neurologic abnormalities 
	



	
	Heart murmur 
	
	
	Sudden death
	


Causes of Heartworm Disease in Cats 


The parasite Dirofilaria immitis is the cause of heartworm disease. It is transmitted by mosquitos. Warm areas, especially in the southern United States, allow efficient mosquito reproduction and, therefore, southern states have a higher percentage of heartworm in cats. Outdoor cats are more susceptible, but even indoor cats can acquire heartworm if a mosquito ventures inside. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Heartworm Disease in Cats 
Heartworm disease in cats is often difficult to diagnose, especially compared to dogs. 


	
	Tests for microfilaria may give frequent false negatives, since cats rarely have circulating microfilaria.  
	
	
	Antibody blood tests can detect immature infections early, even two months after infection. However, a positive result does not confirm an adult infection, and it can even remain positive after cats clear the infection. 
	



	
	Antigen blood tests are the gold standard of diagnosing dogs with heartworm disease but can only test for the presence of female heartworms. Because cats can have very low and single-sex (i.e. all male) worm burdens, this method of testing will also miss some feline infections. 
	
	
	Chest radiographs (X-rays) may help in diagnosing cases of feline heartworm disease. Common features of heartworms can be seen on X-rays in about half of cases. These features include the following: 

	
		
		Enlarged vessels 
		
		
		Lung field inflammation 
		
		
		Lung edema 
		
	
	
	
	Echocardiography (ultrasound) of the heart is useful to visualize the actual live worms in the pulmonary artery and right side of the heart. It can also help determine if pulmonary pressures are abnormal while excluding or confirming cardiac disease. 
	


Positive tests, enlarged arteries on radiographs, and changes in the heart increase the level of suspicion of a heartworm infection. No test is perfect, however, and your vet will use physical exam findings in addition to multiple types of tests to determine the severity of heartworm disease in your cat. 

Treatment of Heartworm Disease in Cats 
Treating heartworm disease in cats is difficult. Many common therapies—including the most common canine treatment, melarsomine—are toxic to cats. The American Heartworm Society, the leading expert for care of heartworm-infected pets, does not currently recommend using therapies that kill adult heartworms in cats. 

Cats not currently displaying any clinical signs may have the option of being monitored over time for      spontaneous cure. A spontaneous cure happens when the cat’s immune system naturally clears the heartworm infection without causing any problems and without treatment. One drug, ivermectin, can reduce worm loads when given over a long period of time (two years or more). However, allergic shock and inflammatory reactions can still occur with both spontaneous-cure and ivermectin-treated cats.  

Veterinarians may prescribe steroids, such as prednisolone, to decrease a cat’s natural strong inflammatory response. Cats will require supportive care and treatment for acute periods of respiratory distress and shock. Your vet may also prescribe the antibiotic doxycycline to help remove the bacteria, called Wolbachia, that lives inside heartworms and increases inflammation. Bronchodilators like terbutaline, theophylline, or albuterol may also be indicated to help with respiratory distress. 

Because of the difficulty with medical management of heartworm disease in cats, the preferred method of treatment is to remove heartworms through surgery.  

A more invasive surgery can remove worms after entering the chest cavity and using forceps to directly remove the worms through the heart. However, all forms of surgery for heartworm in cats can lead to circulatory collapse and death.  

Cats in acute respiratory distress should be stabilized immediately with oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and intravenous steroids and bronchodilators. It is crucial to seek emergency veterinary care as soon as a cat shows any signs of respiratory distress, including open-mouth breathing.

Recovery and Management of Heartworm Disease in Cats 
All heartworm-positive cats should have serologic testing, echocardiograms, and chest radiographs performed every six to 12 months to monitor their heartworm status, whether they were treated or were asymptomatic. Ideally, veterinarians will perform both antibody and antigen tests to gather the most information.  

Veterinarians will cautiously declare a cat recovered from heartworm disease once blood tests are negative in addition to resolution of clinical and radiological signs. The median survival time for cats with heartworm disease is four years.  

Managing heartworm-positive cats for success involves close monitoring, in-depth discussions with veterinarians, and full understanding of the risks of heartworm in cats. The American Heartworm Society is a great resource and has many in-depth articles and additional information on feline heartworm disease. 

Prevention of Heartworm Disease in Cats 
Heartworm is a scary but preventable disease. Many monthly or bimonthly preventatives exist for cats. In addition to preventing heartworm, many also prevent intestinal worm and tick activity. 

Kittens can start preventatives around 8 weeks of age and continue their entire lives. It doesn’t matter if cats spend most of their time indoors, as mosquitos can easily get inside. Common heartworm prophylactic drugs include:

Revolution Plus®

Revolution Plus® is a combination parasiticide that includes the active ingredients selamectin and sarolaner. These medications are used to control heartworm disease as well as providing control for fleas and ticks. The dosage of Revolution Plus® depends on your cat’s weight.

383,Heart Valve Narrowing (Mitral and Tricuspid) in Cats,"Atrioventricular Valvular Stenosis in Cats

There are four chambers in the heart. The top two chambers of the heart are the atria, and the bottom two chambers of the heart are the ventricles. The valves that communicate between the atria and ventricles are the atrioventricular valves. The mitral valve communicates between the left atrium and left ventricle, and the tricuspid valve communicates between the right atrium and the right ventricle. 

Abnormalities in the mitral valve, on the left, affect blood flow to the lungs. The tricuspid valve, on the right side of the heart, is responsible for blood flow to the body.  Abnormalities seen here result in poor blood flow throughout the body.

Stenosis (narrowing) of these valves can occur due to the valves being malformed from birth, bacterial heart muscle infection, cancer of the heart, or hyptertrophic cardiomyopathy (a disease often seen in cats suffering from a thyroid tumor). Stenosis of these valves causes the valves to become leaky, increasing the diastolic pressure gradient between the atrium and the ventricle (the pressure gradient is the period in which the heart's chambers dilate and fill with blood – diastole of the ventricles follows diastole of the atria).  

Mitral valve narrowing can cause high blood pressure in the lungs, trouble breathing, and coughing. Mitral valve stenosis is more commonly seen more in Siamese breeds.

Tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to swelling of the legs and paws, and an enlarged liver may be seen on radiographis images. 

Both mitral and tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF).

Symptoms and Types 


	
	Exercise intolerance
	
	
	Fainting (syncope)
	
	
	Trouble breathing 
	
	
	Coughing (mitral valve narrowing)
	
	
	Pale or bluish skin color (cyanosis) 
	
	
	Fluid in the abdomen, swelling (tricuspid valve stenosis)
	
	
	Stunted growth
	
	
	Spitting up blood
	


Causes

There are a variety of causes that narrow a cat's heart valves, much of it depending on the type of valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis, for example, is congenital and commonly affects Siamese. Tricuspid valve stenosis, meanwhile, is also congenital in nature and may be due to cancer of the heart and bacterial infection of the heart muscle. Moreover, both of these are usually diagnossed at an early age.



Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms, including any information you have on your cat's family line. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of these tests typically return normal levels. Based on the apparent symptoms and the results of the initial physical exam, your veterinarian should be able to narrow the cause down to which type of heart valve disease is present. This will need to be confirmed with further testing.

For diagnostic purposes, your veterinarian will need to view the heart using imaging tools. X-rays can help your veterinarian to determine if there is enlargement of the valves or atrium on either side of the heart, and echocardiography will show atrial dilation, and possibly abnormal flow of the blood through the heart. Electrocardiograph readings can also help your doctor to determine if the heart's electrical functioning is being affected. An abnormal rhythm, and the exact measurement of the abnormality can be a great help in determining which side of the heart is most affected.  

Your doctor may also use a diagnostic method called angiography, which utilizes X-ray imaging along with a radio-opaque contrasting agent (dye) that is injected into the blood vessels. This dye makes it possible to visualize the vessels internally and evaluate the flow of blood through the heart and surrounding vessels. 

In rare instances, a veterinarian may also want to check for pressure disparities within the heart (intracardial) and within the vessels (intravascular) by catheterizing it, a process called cardiac catheterization. This method can also be used for injection of contrasting agents, to take a sample for biopsy, if cancer is suspected, and to assess the severity of the disease. 

Treatment

Medicine is essential to treating heart valve disorders. Diuretics may be used to reduce fluid retention, but other drugs of choice will be based on the final diagnosis. While it is possible to surgically replace or repair damaged valves, it is expensive and has limited availability. An alternative treatment to surgery is a method called balloon valvuloplasty, which may be performed by a specialist after a referral from your veterinarian. Intensive care hospitalization will be necessary for medical treatment of your cat if it is suffering from congestive heart failure.  

Living and Management

Your cat will need to be rechecked about every three months or sooner to see if there are continuing signs of chronic heart failure and to adjust the treatment accordingly. Chest X-rays, an electrocardiogram (EKG – to measure the electrical activity of the heart) and echocardiography will very likely be performed at the follow-up appointments.  Your veterinarian will discuss precautions and home treatment with you, but generally, cats that are diagnosed with AVD need to be restricted to a low-salt diet and exercise should be restricted.  

Because this is a genetically based disease, if your cat is diagnosed with it, your veterinarian will strongly advise against breeding your cat out. Spaying or neutering is indicated."," and Types

384,Heart Valve Malformation in Cats,"What is Heart Valve Malformation in Cats?
Heart valve malformation, also known as atrioventricular valve dysplasia, occurs when the atrioventricular valves are malformed and do not fully close. Instead of flowing only one way through the heart, blood backs up from the ventricle into the atria, and from there into either the lungs (mitral valve dysplasia) or the body (tricuspid valve dysplasia).

If the condition is untreated, left-sided or right-sided congestive heart failure will develop.

The feline heart is a muscle made up of four chambers ‑ two atrias and two ventricles. The atrias serve as receptacles for blood entering the heart, from the lungs on the left side, and the body on the right side. From there, blood is pumped into the ventricles and then either flows into the lungs from the right side to pick up oxygen or out from the left side to deliver oxygenated blood to the body.

The atrioventricular valves ‑ mitral and tricuspid ‑ open and close between the atria and ventricles and direct the blood flow throughout the heart. Closure of these valves is audible and results in a “lub-dub” heard when listening with a stethoscope. The tricuspid valve, which contains three cusps, lies between the right atria and right ventricle. The mitral valve, which contains two cusps, is located between the left atria and left ventricle.

If the valves are malformed and blood is no longer moving one way, the heart muscle must work harder to pump the same amount of blood out to either the lungs or the body. It will eventually bulk up, becoming enlarged either in size or thickness. Unfortunately, this process restricts the amount of blood pushed out due to a sheer decrease in volume. As the atria become enlarged stretching occurs, resulting in increased platelet activity and secondary blood clot formation which can have life-threatening consequences.

 

Symptoms of Heart Valve Malformation in Cats
Cats suffering from heart valve malformation often have these general symptoms:


	
	Failure to gain weight
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Fainting spells
	
	
	Muscle wasting
	


If the malformation is in the mitral valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with left-sided heart failure because fluid accumulates in the lung and chest cavity:


	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	“Stretching” postures
	
	
	Cough
	
	
	Pale or blue gums
	
	
	Weak pulses, felt on the inside of the cat’s thighs
	
	
	Cool extremities
	


If the malformation is in the tricuspid valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with right-sided heart failure:


	
	Ascites, or fluid buildup, in the abdomen
	
	
	Distension of the jugular veins
	
	
	Weakness or collapse
	
	
	Fluid accumulation in the lower limbs
	
	
	Enlarged liver
	


Unfortunately, for some pet parents, the only sign will be the sudden passing of the cat, as cats with severe congenital heart defects are likely to die prematurely. 

Causes of Heart Valve Malformation in Cats
Congenital heart defects are rare in cats. It is estimated that less than 1 percent of the population is affected, with males and purebred cats such as Maine Coons and Ragdolls having a higher incidence.

Specifically, with atrioventricular valve dysplasia, the defects are present at birth and mostly involve some sort of developmental problem where the valves are thickened, shortened or attached to the wrong location of the heart. The chordae tendineae (cords of tissue that connect the valves to the heart muscle) may be thickened or elongated which affects the valve’s ability to function.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Heart Valve Malformation in Cats
For most cats, an audible murmur can be detected, usually during one of the first of several kitten wellness exams. Further testing is then recommended.

Sometimes, the veterinarian can detect another heart sound or a “gallop” rhythm. Once detected, or if you have a cat predisposed to atrioventricular valve dysplasia, a thorough cardiac exam will be performed. This often will include:


	
	Diagnostic Imaging, such as chest X-rays and an ultrasound of the heart, referred to as an echocardiogram or EKG. It determines heart size, chamber thickness, pressures and valve function
	
	
	Blood pressure measurements
	
	
	Electrocardiogram
	
	
	Cardiac biomarker evaluation (NT-proBNP and cTnI), which can aid the veterinarian in detecting underlying heart disease
	


Blood work and urine testing are often conducted (though the results are typically unhelpful) as a baseline to serve for medication monitoring, and the effects heart valve malformation may have on the organs.

For some cats with mild atrioventricular valve dysplasia, follow-up and careful monitoring may be the recommended therapy. Most cases require some type of medical management. Cats are usually prescribed a combination of the following:


	
	Diuretics (water pills), to remove excess fluid from the blood
	
	
	Blood thinners, such as aspirin or Plavix, to reduce the formation of a blood clot
	
	
	ACE-inhibitors, such as Enalapril or Benazepril to reduce blood pressure and help reduce the heart’s workload
	
	
	Pimobendan, a drug that not only improves the effectiveness of the heart’s contraction, but also helps regulate heart rate
	
	
	Atenolol, a beta-blocker, that helps regulate blood pressure and heart rate
	


Open-heart surgery to repair or replace the valve can be performed, although this is often limited and has been more widely used in the treatment of mitral regurgitation in dogs.

Recovery and Management of Heart Valve Malformation in Cats
Cats with mild heart defects may live for years without any clinical signs and may have a relatively normal life—or they may present with clinical signs of heart failure later in life. If the defect is severe, signs of heart failure and fatal arrhythmias may occur, and although the signs can be treated, the prognosis is often poor.

Exercise restriction, nutritional management (often geared toward sodium reduction), and use of antibiotics when undergoing surgical procedures may also be recommended. Cats diagnosed with hyperthyroidism should be monitored and screened for the presence of structural heart disease. 

Cats that have been diagnosed with atrioventricular valve dysplasia and/or heart failure should have frequent checkups and blood work to ensure that the medications prescribed are not having negative effects on the kidneys. Depending on the severity on the defect, your cat may need chest X-rays every three to six months and echocardiograms every six to 12 months.
Heart Valve Malformation in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with a heart valve malformation?Some cats can have a relatively normal life, while others will fail to survive into adulthood, depending on the severity of the malformation. Cats diagnosed with congestive heart failure have a poor prognosis, with an average survival of 3 months to 1.5 years.
Can cats live with congenital heart disease?Cats can live with congenital heart disease, but for those whose disease is caught early will have a better quality of life because some diseases can be managed medically. Others, such as patent ductus arteriosus can be treated surgically.

Cats suffering from heart valve malformation often have these general symptoms:


	
	Failure to gain weight
	
	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Fainting spells
	
	
	Muscle wasting
	


If the malformation is in the mitral valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with left-sided heart failure because fluid accumulates in the lung and chest cavity:


	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	“Stretching” postures
	
	
	Cough
	
	
	Pale or blue gums
	
	
	Weak pulses, felt on the inside of the cat’s thighs
	
	
	Cool extremities
	


If the malformation is in the tricuspid valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with right-sided heart failure:


	
	Ascites, or fluid buildup, in the abdomen
	
	
	Distension of the jugular veins
	
	
	Weakness or collapse
	
	
	Fluid accumulation in the lower limbs
	
	
	Enlarged liver
	


Unfortunately, for some pet parents, the only sign will be the sudden passing of the cat, as cats with severe congenital heart defects are likely to die prematurely.

385,Heart Valve Infection (Infective Endocarditis) in Cats,"Infective Endocarditis in Cats
  
Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart is medically referred to as endocarditis.  Infective endocarditis can occur in response to any infection of the body. Generalized infections in the body may invade the inner lining of heart, as well as the valves of the heart. If the underlying disease if not treated in time, complications can lead to heart failure and death. This condition is rarely seen in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Variable set of symptoms may be present in patient depending upon the nature and site of infection, complications and extent of affects on heart. The following symptoms may be present in an affected cat:


    Fever
    Cough
    Bluish discoloration of the skin
    Weakness
    Lethargy
    Anorexia
    Weight loss
    Reluctance to move
    Body aches and pains
    Symptoms related to heart problems
    Difficult breathing
    Intermittent lameness
    Gastrointestinal disturbances


Causes


    Bacterial Infections
    Previous major surgery


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a complete background history for your cat, including information about the onset of symptoms, any illnesses or injuries your cat has experienced, any surgical procedures, and the duration and frequency of symptoms that have been apparent.

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination, including basic laboratory testing: a complete blood count (CBC) test, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests may reveal information related to the underlying infection, and may point to the organs being affected.

Blood cultures will help to determine the causative agent involved in the infection and will also allow your veterinarian to determine the most suitable antibiotics for treatment of the underlying infection. A visual examination of the heart, using radiographic (i.e., X-ray) studies can help your veterinarian to determine the extent of heart involvement, and echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to image the inner organs, is an excellent tool for a detailed evaluation of the heart's functioning ability. Your veterinarian will also need to measure the electrical activity of the heart, which is done using an electrocardiogram (ECG) to record the heart's movement and impulses.



Treatment

This is a serious health problem and your cat will most likely require immediate hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. Fluid therapy and antibiotic therapy will be started to maintain body fluid level and to control the infection, respectively.

Patients with valve involvement generally do not have good prognosis. Treatment is usually continued for 12 weeks. During that time your veterinarian will take multiple blood samples at regular intervals to measure how much of the infection, if any, is still present. After antibiotic therapy has stopped, blood samples will be taken to confirm that the infection has been resolved.

Living and Management

If your cat's heart problem was mild, it will usually respond well to treatment. If the endocarditis was diagnosed in time, and aggressive treatment was employed along with detailed follow up, the chances of a full recovery are greatly enhanced.

You may need to take your cat to the veterinarian for weekly follow-up examinations, and to determine overall progress. Your veterinarian may also suggest a special diet for your cat to improve cardiovascular functioning and organ health. Treatment will be directed towards treating the underlying infection as well as the heart problems that have resulted from such infections. In cases where a diagnosis was not made early on, and the   disease has had an opportunity to advance, the overall prognosis may be very poor due to further complications that are common in affected cats. In such a case, you will need to consult with your veterinarian on alternative plans."," and Types

386,Heart Tumors in Cats,"Myocardial Tumors in Cats

Myocardial tumors are rare types of tumors that affect the heart. When they do occur, they tend to occur in older animals. A myocardial tumor can take either of two forms: a benign tumor, which is a mass of tissue that does not metastasize; and a malignant tumor, which does metastasize throughout the body. A benign tumor might be categorized as a hemangioma – a harmless growth consisting mainly of newly formed blood or lymph vessels. Conversely, a malignant tumor might be categorized as a hemangiosarcoma - a are and abnormal, rapidly reproducing tissue growth that arises from the blood vessels in the heart.

A tumor that arises from the fibrous tissue, like heart valve tissue, is referred to as a fibroma if it is benign, and a fibrosarcoma if it is malignant. There are also tumors that develop in the softer, connective tissue in the upper chambers of the heart (atria). Benign tumors of this sort are termed myxomas; myxosarcomas when they are malignant. One particular type of tumor that is always malignant is the rhabdomyosarcoma – a tumor that arises from the skeletal muscle in the heart.

There are also tumors that can spread to the heart secondarily. Some tumors which do not arise in the heart, but which spread to it, are lymphomas - malignant tumors of the lymph nodes; neurofibromas - benign tumors of nerve fiber origin; granular cell tumors – of unknown origin, which can be malignant or benign; and osteosarcomas - malignant tumors that originate in the bone.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms are dependent on what type of tumor is in the heart, and where in the heart it is located:


    Heart rhythm abnormalities (cardiac arrhythmia)
    Heart murmurs
    Enlargement of the heart
    Sudden heart failure
    Signs of heart failure due to heart tumor:
    
        Coughing
        Difficulty breathing, even while at rest
        Sudden collapse
        Exercise intolerance
        General fatigue
        Fainting
        Lack of appetite
        Bloated, fluid filled abdomen
    
    

 
Causes

The causes for myocardial tumors are still unknown.

[ pageberak ]

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a baseline blood work profile. This will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Chest x-rays and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the heart, so that a complete assessment can be made of the heart, and any masses that are present within it. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for biopsy.

Treatment

Even if the mass in the heart is extensive, or has begun to spread through the body, surgical resection is still the recommended treatment of choice for most heart tumors. This holds even if the surgery will not cure the condition. But, if the tumor is benign, surgical resection may be curative. Chemotherapy can be administered in the case of malignant heart tumors, but unfortunately, in many cases patients will die in spite of treatment.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat in order to perform serial heart ultrasounds. These examinations will help your doctor to follow the progress of your cat's condition as well as to check the heart muscle for signs of doxorubicin toxicity – if doxorubicin has been prescribed as part of a chemotherapeutic program. Doxorubicin is an effective drug for treating malignant cancers, but one of the negative side effects is that it can damage heart muscle. Your veterinarian will also take chest x-rays at each visit to make sure the tumor has not spread. The final prognosis for most malignant myocardial tumors is guarded to poor."," and Types

387,Heart Sac Inflammation (Pericarditis) in Cats,"Pericarditis in Cats

If a cat's pericardium (the membranous sac surrounding the heart and roots of the vessels) becomes inflamed, it is a condition referred to as pericarditis. The pericardium is made up of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a membranous inner layer that adheres closely to the heart. Within the sac is a layer of pericardial fluid made up of serum, a watery fluid that serves to keep the surfaces of the membranous sac and heart moist. The body's membranes will also secrete serum when they detect inflammation of the surrounding tissues and organs.

When either of the layers of the pericardium becomes inflamed, the natural reaction is for the membranes to produce more serum, which leads to an excess of serum in the pericardium. The build-up of fluid compresses the heart, placing too much pressure on it, and on the surrounding tissue, typically leading to more inflammation and further swelling.

Pericarditis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Right-sided congestive heart failure is the usual outcome of pericarditis. Other symptoms include:


    Anorexia
    Lethargy
    Fluid 	buildup in the abdomen
    Difficulty 	breathing
    Weak 	pulse
    Increased 	heart rate
    Collapse


Causes

May be diagnosed as idiopathic or agnogenic (meaning that it is not related to anything in particular, and is of unknown cause). The only apparent problem may be that there is excess fluid buildup, with seemingly nothing else to explain the disease. Other common causes include:

1. Trauma
2. Bacterial infection:

    E. 	coli: systemic infection, typically gastrointestinal
    Streptococcus: 	various types, attacks respiratory system
    Staphylococcus 	aureus: infection of the skin, nose, and throat
    Actinomyces: 	invasion that causes lumpy tumors in the neck, chest, abdomen, and 	around the face and mouth; also called 'lumpy jaw'

3. Viral infection:

    Feline 	infectious peritonitis (FIP), or feline coronavirus: a serious 	disorder that often attacks the abdomen, kidney, or brain

4. Fungalinfection:

    Cryptococcus: 	transmitted through infected soil

5. Parasitic infection:

    Toxoplasmosis: 	a parasitic infection that attacks the central nervous system; 	fever, seizures, and respiratory distress are symptoms of this 	infection; mainly occurs secondary to a condition that is weakening 	the immune system

6. Protozoal infection

  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to look for an underlying cause, or systemic illness. If bacterial based pericarditis is suspected, your veterinarian will take a fluid sample of the pericardial effusion for aerobic and anaerobic culture. That is, examination of tissue that lives with oxygen, and tissue that lives without oxygen.

Thoracic radiograph images (X-rays of the chest), and echocardiogram images are essential for an accurate visual diagnosis. Other, less sensitive tests which might still supply useful information about the heart are cardiac catheterization, where a tube is inserted into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, and then threaded up into the chambers of the heart; and electrocardiogram, which records the heart's electrical muscle activity. Both tests measure functionality: blood pressure and flow, rhythm, and how well the heart muscle is pumping.

Treatment

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the pericarditis. All cats with this disease will need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Chemotherapy will be prescribed if there are cancerous neoplastic (abnormal tissue growth) conditions, and bacterial infections will be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. A pericardectomy surgery to remove part of the pericardium may also be necessary.

Living and Management

This condition will sometimes reoccur. If signs of illness return at anytime after taking your cat home, call your veterinarian immediately for advisement."," and Types

388,Heart Murmur in Cats,"What is Heart Murmur in Cats?
A heart murmur is an abnormal heart sound noted when listening to your pet’s heart with a stethoscope.  

Typically, there are only two heart sounds that are considered normal. An extra heart sound or a “whooshing” noise heard when the heart beats is considered a heart murmur and is a common finding in middle aged to older cats. In some cases, it is found in younger cats and can be a concern for congenital issues (those present at birth).  

The “whooshing” noise or heart murmur itself is caused by turbulent (rough) blood flow through the heart. Blood should flow through the four normal chambers of the heart and through the valves (doorways between chambers) in a smooth, calm way. When there are barriers to flow, turbulence occurs and it changes the normal “lub” and “dub” heart sounds.  

Turbulence can be caused by heart valve malfunctions, holes in the walls of the heart or arteries, or narrowing of blood vessels or heart chambers. Turbulence can also occur from excitation and fast heart rates or thinning of the blood (anemia). 

Heart murmurs are classified three ways: 


	
	Based on their grade (the loudness of the murmur) 
	
	
	Configuration (when the murmur is the loudest during contraction and relaxation of the heart) 
	



	
	Location of the murmur (when listening with a stethoscope) 
	


Veterinarians grade heart murmurs on a scale of 1-6 depending on how loud the heart murmur is upon listening. This is a subjective scale based on what the specific veterinarian hears while listening to the heart with a stethoscope. 


	
	Grade I: audible only to a trained ear or hardly heard at all 
	
	
	Grade II: soft but audible 
	
	
	Grade III: intermediate and the most common grade of heart murmur 
	



	
	Grade IV: louder murmur that radiates across the heart, often on both sides of the chest 
	
	
	Grade V: loud heart murmur heard before the stethoscope even touches the chest and often has a noticeable “thrill” or vibration felt when touching the chest wall 
	
	
	Grade VI: loudest heart murmur heard before the stethoscope even touches the chest and often has a noticeable “thrill” or vibration felt when touching the chest wall 
	


Finding the location of the heart murmur is difficult in cats because of their small chest cavities, and it is often heard best along the sternum. 

Configuration depends on the sound of the murmur during systole (active contraction) or diastole (relaxation) of the heart. These differences are often termed crescendo-decrescendo, plateau, or decrescendo heart murmurs. Some heart murmurs occur throughout the cardiac contraction cycle and are termed continuous or to-and-fro murmurs. 

The grade, location, and configuration of heart murmurs is helpful for finding the underlying cause.  

Heart murmurs can be congenital or acquired. Congenital heart murmurs are present at birth or soon after birth and are often associated with heart defects. These types of murmurs can be very quiet early in life and are not always found until later with growth and maturation.  

Acquired heart murmurs occur at any point in life and can be benign in cause or can be associated with heart disease (cardiomyopathy).  

Some heart murmurs are called “innocent” or benign. This means that there is no underlying heart disease causing the abnormal heart sounds. They are found often in cats of any age and are usually intermittent (sounds come and go) and are quiet when listened to with a stethoscope. 

Symptoms of Heart Murmur in Cats
Pet parents will typically not notice any symptoms in cats until heart disease progresses and signs of congestive heart failure or thromboembolism (blood clots) develop. Heart murmurs are usually found incidentally during a routine physical examination. Your veterinarian will discuss possible causes and next steps for diagnosis.   

Symptoms of severe heart disease, heart failure, and thromboembolism include: 


	
	Chronic weight loss or muscle wasting 
	



	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Hiding behavior 
	
	
	Weakness 
	
	
	Coughing or wheezing 
	
	
	Exercise intolerance: panting with mild exertion 
	



	
	Increased respiratory rate at rest 
	
	
	Increased effort to breathe, open mouth breathing, abdominal push to exhale, dyssynchronous breathing (chest heaves out when abdomen pulls in and abdomen heaves out when chest pulls in), or outstretched neck 
	
	
	Fluid from mouth or nostrils 
	
	
	Change in the color of the gums to blue, gray, or white 
	
	
	Lethargy 
	



	
	Collapse 
	
	
	Paralysis of the hind limbs 
	
	
	Painful vocalization 
	
	
	Stunted growth in kittens with severe congenital causes 
	


Causes of Heart Murmur in Cats
The cause of heart murmurs in cats varies depending on if they are benign or structural in origin. The cause of a heart murmur in a cat can be due to various underlying conditions such as: 


	
	Anemia 
	
	
	Pacing or anxiety 
	
	
	High blood pressure (systemic hypertension) 
	



	
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): inherited or acquired secondary to feline hyperthyroidism 
	
	
	Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) 
	
	
	Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) 
	
	
	Heart wall defects or holes in the heart walls (atrial or ventricular septal defects) 
	
	
	Heart valve deficiencies: mitral, tricuspid, or aortic valves 
	



	
	Stenosis of the valves: subaortic, aortic, mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonic valves 
	
	
	Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): a heart defect that occurs when the prenatal blood vessel called ductus arteriosus does not collapse down after birth and remains open, diverting blood away from the lungs 
	
	
	Tetralogy of Fallot: severe congenital malformations of the heart 
	
	
	Thromboemboli (blood clots) in the heart or vessels 
	
	
	Heartworm disease (rare in cats) 
	



	
	Endocarditis (infection of one or more heart valves) 
	


Maine Coon cats are prone to moderate to severe HCM and HOCM. Persians and American and British shorthairs are also prone to less severe cases of inherited HCM. Siamese have a higher incidence of congenital PDA and inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

How Veterinarians Diagnose Heart Murmur in Cats
The cause of a heart murmur in a cat is typically not found by using a stethoscope alone to listen to the lungs, though this can be helpful in determining the location, configuration, and grade of the murmur. Unfortunately, a benign or innocent heart murmur can sound like a heart murmur caused by severe heart disease in a cat. 

Your veterinarian will likely recommend full blood work, including a cardiac proBNP, which gives a quantifiable number value to the amount of stretch on the heart muscle itself. One elevated proBNP level is not always clinically significant, but along with clinical signs or when checking this level chronically, it can be helpful to reveal underlying heart disease in cats.  

Blood work can help rule out anemia or underlying systemic disease, such as hyperthyroidism, which can contribute to heart disease.  

Chest radiographs are often recommended to assess the size of the heart, to evaluate the vessels going to and from the heart, and to assess the lungs for any signs of fluid or congestive heart failure (CHF).  

An echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart is considered the gold standard to investigate the underlying cause of a heart murmur. Sometimes an electrocardiogram (EKG) is recommended if an abnormal heart rhythm is noted. Often a Doppler blood pressure is also performed because of the high incidence of systemic hypertension in middle aged to older cats with underlying heart disease.  

Treatment of Heart Murmur in Cats
A heart murmur itself does not require treatment, but the underlying cause of the heart murmur may need to be addressed. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity of the heart murmur. Benign or innocent murmurs usually require no treatment at all. Often, cat age, overall health, and the cost of therapy are major considerations with treatment of heart disease in cats. 

CHF, depending on its severity, often requires hospitalization, diuretics (water pills), cardiac medications, and oxygen therapy. In many cases of CHF in cats, pleural effusion (fluid buildup around the lungs) needs to be removed by a procedure called thoracocentesis to allow the lungs to fully expand again.  

Some congenital heart murmurs, such as small holes in the heart walls (or septal defects), may resolve within 6 months with continued growth. In some cases of congenital heart disease in cats, surgery is necessary to close a PDA or septal defect.  

Treatment of other underlying health conditions, such as anemia or hyperthyroidism, may help with underlying heart murmurs. 

Each case is different, so your veterinarian will work with you to determine the best diagnostic and treatment plan while also discussing the prognosis for your cat. 

Recovery and Management of Heart Murmur in Cats
Close monitoring of heart murmurs and heart disease is necessary to check for progression of the condition. Management of CHF and some congenital cardiac issues in cats is often done with cardiac medications, cardiac supplements, and lifelong diet changes.  

Prognosis ranges from excellent when discussing benign heart murmurs to grave when discussing severe congenital or acquired heart disease. Long-term prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause of the heart murmur and response to treatment. Focus is not placed on cure in most cases, rather it is placed on quality of life and comfort for your cat.
Heart Murmur in Cats FAQsDo all heart murmurs in cats sound the same?No. Heart murmurs vary depending on grade (loudness), configuration (whether heard during contraction or relaxation of the heart), and location of the murmur.
What is the prognosis for cats with a heart murmur?Prognosis depends on the cause of the heart murmur. It is typically excellent for benign murmurs, but prognosis is often grave when there is severe heart disease. Your cat’s long-term prognosis will also depend on their response to any treatment needed.
What is a “functional heart murmur” in cats?A functional heart murmur is one that is found in a heart that is structurally and functionally normal during an echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart. This can be due to an innocent heart murmur in kittens that usually disappears over 6 months or from stress and elevated heart rate that corrects once the cat is calm. Functional heart murmurs are also caused by some systemic issues outside of the heart, such as anemia and hyperthyroidism.
What is an “innocent murmur” in cats?“Innocent” or benign heart murmurs have no underlying heart disease causing the abnormal heart sounds. They are found often in cats of any age and are usually intermittent and quiet when listened to with a stethoscope. Innocent heart murmurs can only be confirmed via echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart.

389,Heart Medicine Poisoning in Cats,"Digoxin Toxicity in Cats

Digoxin is commonly used for treating congestive heart failure, its primary benefit being to help the heart contract. While digoxin can be an extremely useful medication, the difference between a therapeutic dosage and a toxic dosage can be negligible, and overdoses frequently occur.

For this reason, your veterinarian will need to monitor digoxin blood levels throughout treatment. Owners also need to be aware of toxicity signs, as they can be subtle and may have the same symptoms as heart failure.

Symptoms and Types

One of the most significant concerns about this condition is toxicity to the heart cells themselves, called myocardial toxicity. When this occurs, abnormal heart rhythms can occur, often leading to heart failure.

Depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are often the first symptoms your cat will display. This can occur even when the medication is given at the prescribed dose because  therapeutic and toxic levels are very close.

With acute overdose, your cat may become comatose or have seizures. Any time toxicity is a concern, it is important to consult with your veterinarian, as the effects of toxicity can progress quickly.

Diagnosis

It is important to take routine blood samples to assess the digoxin level in your cat's serum. Doses are initially based on lean body weight, but individual cats metabolize the drug differently.

For this reason, your veterinarian will take blood samples to determine serum digoxin levels throughout the treatment. Additional blood analyses for electrolytes, organ function and cell counts are also important.

An electrocardiogram, which checks for arrhythmias, is critical for determining the prognosis and an appropriate treatment plan.



Treatment

No additional digoxin should be given once you have noticed symptoms of toxicity in your cat. It is important that your cat receive emergency medical attention immediately if there is an overdose, because toxicity can quickly lead to death. If an acute overdose has taken place, it may also be necessary to induce vomiting by using activated charcoal or other approved methods.

Your cat's fluid and electrolyte balance will also need to be corrected, as these abnormalities are a significant contributor to the toxic affects of the digoxin the heart. If an abnormal rhythm is present, antiarrhythmic medications may be given. A continuous electrocardiogram may be positioned on your cat to monitor its heart rhythm.

Antibody therapy, which uses an agent to bind with the cardiac stimulant that is in the blood stream, is used in humans with digoxin toxicity and has also been used on cats. However, the medication can be costly.

Living and Management

Management of the disease will change, and different medications will be prescribed because congestive heart failure is progressive. Careful management and frequent follow-up exams are critical, especially if digoxin is related with another treatment plan. Expect to have your cat's blood levels checked periodically throughout treatment.

Having a digoxin toxicity episode may be a concern, but lower doses can begin again after the blood has dropped below toxic range and your cat has no further signs of toxicity. Recent reports have indicated that using digoxin at levels below therapeutic levels can be beneficial and safer."," and Types

One of the most significant concerns about this condition is toxicity to the heart cells themselves, called myocardial toxicity. When this occurs, abnormal heart rhythms can occur, often leading to heart failure.

Depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are often the first symptoms your cat will display. This can occur even when the medication is given at the prescribed dose because  therapeutic and toxic levels are very close.

With acute overdose, your cat may become comatose or have seizures. Any time toxicity is a concern, it is important to consult with your veterinarian, as the effects of toxicity can progress quickly.

390,Heart Inflammation (Myocarditis) in Cats,"Myocarditis in Cats
 
Inflammation of the heart's muscular wall (or myocardium) is medically referred to as myocarditis. It is often caused by bacterial, viral, rikettsial, funal, and protozoal infections, which may affect the heart directly or reach the heart from other body parts.
 
Clinical symptoms depend on the type of infection and extent of lesions, but in severe cases, heart failure may result.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The inflammation itself may be focal or diffused throughout the myocardium. Other symptoms associated with myocarditis include:
 

    Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm)
    Cough
    Exercise intolerance
    Difficult breathing
    Weakness
    Collapse
    Fever
    Other symptoms related to infections may also be present

 
Causes
 
Although viral, bacterial, rikettsial, funal, and protozoal infections are the most common cause of myocaditis, drug toxicity to the heart can also be a factor.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, paying close attention to the cat's cardiovascular system. Various laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- will be used to isolate and identify the causative organism. The abnormalities revealed by these tests, however, will depend on the affected organ.
 
Your veterinarian will also perform an echocardiogram (EKG) on the cat to evaluate the extent of myocardial damage and abnormal accumulation of fluid around the heart. In addition to evaluating the abnormalities related to heart dysfunction, EKG findings help in differentiating the location of the lesions within heart. Thoracic X-rays, meanwhile, help evaluate the heart size, whether fluids are located in the lungs, and other such abnormalities.
 
Other more specific testing include pathological exams of fluid samples taken from around the heart.


 


Treatment
 
Cats with severe myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or severe heart rhythm problems may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment. If specific causative organism is identified, infection will be treated with suitable medicine, such as antibiotics to fight off bacterial infections. There are also medications to correct heart rhythym issues, should the cat be suffering from them. In some patients, a pacemaker may need to be implanted.
 
Living and Management
 
The overall prognosis for myocarditis depends on the extent and severity of disease. Cats with CHF as a result of myocarditis, for example, have very poor prognosis, while those with milder forms of the disease respond well to treatment.
 
You will need to visit your veterinarian regularly for follow-up evaluation and frequent laboratory testing will be conducted to monitor progress and response to treatment. Limiting your cat's activity is important for recovery, as well as setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets.
 
Certain diet restrictions may be recommended, especially those concerning your cat's salt intake."," and Types

391,Heart Impulse Block in Cats,"Sinus Arrest and Sinoatrial Block in Cats

The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sinus arrest is a disorder of heart beat impulse formation caused by a slowing down or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity – the automatic behavior of the tissues that set the pace for the heart's rhythm. It is the failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time that leads to sinus arrest. Persistent sinus arrest that is not due to the use of a drug is often indicative of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) - a disorder of the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node.

Sinoatrial block is a disorder of impulse conduction. This is when an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to be conducted through the atria (the interior of the heart), or when it does so with delay. Most commonly, the basic rhythm of the sinus node is not disturbed when the impulses fail to conduct properly.

Symptoms and Types


    Usually 	asymptomatic (without symptoms)
    Weakness
    Fainting
    Pale 	gums
    Very 	slow heart rate, may be possible to detect


Sinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only.

Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity)  and Mobitz type II.

First-degree 	sinoatrial block     

    Slowed 		conduction 

Second-degree 	sinoatrial block

    Failure 		to conduct is intermittent
    Two 		types of second-degree SA block occur:
    
        Mobitz 			type I/Wenckebach periodicity – speed of conduction slows 			gradually until failure of impulses to reach the atria occurs
        Mobitz 			type II – block is all, or none, until complete conduction 			failure takes place
        The 			two types cannot be differentiated on a surface ECG 
    
    

Third-degree 	sinoatrial block     

    Complete 		failure to conduct


Causes

Physiologic     

    Vagal 		stimulation (i.e., stimulation of the vagus nerves of the pharynx), 		caused by coughing, and irritation of the pharynx (back of the 		mouth/beginning of throat)
    High 		pressure in the eye, or carotid artery sinus (carries blood from 		the heart to the brain)
    Surgical 		manipulation 

Pathologic     

    Degenerative 		heart disease: heart grows tougher and less flexible
    Dilatory 		heart disease: heart enlarges, and fails
    Sudden 		inflammation of the heart
    Cancer 		of the heart
    Sick 		sinus syndrome (SSS): intermittent rapid and slow supraventricular 		arrhythmias
    Irritation 		of vagus nerve, secondary to neck or chest cancer
    Electrolyte 		imbalance: abnormal levels of potassium in blood
    Drug 		toxicity (e.g., digoxin)


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The electrolyte panel may show hyperkalemia, abnormal levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to arrhythmias. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a history of symptoms, and their onset.

Thoracic (chest) x-rays and/or a cardiac ultrasound imaging may be taken by your veterinarian to confirm or rule out heart disease and abnormal tissue growth (neoplasia).

A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action of the SA Node. Cats with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine.

Treatment

Most patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Only patients showing clinical signs of illness should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be given to patients in need of it. Very ill patients that are not responding to medical therapy may require implantation of an artificial pacemaker, and will be hospitalized prior to surgery in preparation of it. If your pet becomes excessively weak, or is showing signs of losing consciousness, or fainting, it will need to have its activity restricted.

Living and Management

After care will be dependent on whether your cat has an underlying disease, along with the SA block. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary, and an ECG reading will be done at each visit to follow your cat's progress.  If your cat becomes weak, or loses consciousness, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement."," and Types

392,Heart Failure in Cats,"What Is Heart Failure in Cats?
Heart failure is a progressive condition in which the heart muscle is too weak to meet the body’s demands. To understand heart failure, it is important to know how the heart muscle works and what it does for your cat's body.

The heart pumps blood to various parts of the body such as the lungs, brain, kidneys, and limbs. The blood provides oxygen and other nutrients to body tissues. Blood circulation also helps to release waste from tissues by removing carbon dioxide.

When the heart is not functioning properly, it can affect every organ and muscle in the body. When there is heart failure, the heart has difficulty bringing enough oxygen to tissue and is slow in removing waste.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Heart Failure in Cats
Heart failure usually starts as a progression of heart disease, with few symptoms to even suggest your cat is sick. Cats can play, eat normally, and have normal bowel movements early in heart disease. It is important to remember that heart disease is not heart failure, although heart disease may eventually lead to heart failure.

As heart disease advances, pet parents may start to notice some signs and symptoms. Cats may begin to cough, become lethargic, not eat as well, and even become out of breath or pant during normal activities such as walking or playing. If left undetected, this can develop into heart failure. If left unchecked, the condition is likely to be fatal.

If your cat is experiencing any symptoms of heart disease or failure, take them to a veterinarian immediately. If your cat appears to be healthy, a full physical exam is recommended annually with your veterinarian to detect early signs.

Causes of Heart Failure in Cats
Disease of the heart can be caused by birth defects, infections, other major organ problems, and changes in the anatomy of the heart that sometimes come with aging. Heart failure can be more common in Maine Coon Cats, Persians, and Ragdolls.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Heart Failure in Cats 
At an early stage of heart disease, a physical exam by your veterinarian may be the only way to tell there is something wrong. Your vet may notice that your cat's heart sounds abnormal when listening with a stethoscope.

The cat may have a heart murmur, which lets the veterinarian know that there is blood moving through the heart in an abnormal direction. Blood should flow into the heart via just one entrance and out through one exit. If blood is allowed to move back in the opposite direction, it will cause a distinctive swishing sound.

During a physical exam, your veterinarian may also determine if your cat’s heart is beating too fast, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm.  

To diagnose a problem with the heart, your veterinarian will likely want to do several tests including:


	Bloodwork, which will test the function of most of the organs, including the thyroid and kidneys.
	Chest radiographs (x-rays), which will let the vet check the heart size and the condition of the lungs. This is important, since the lungs and heart work closely together.
	Blood pressure, to make sure your cat does not need to be treated for hypertension (high blood pressure). Hypertension can come from heart disease, but it can also contribute to heart disease.
	An ultrasound of the heart, called an echocardiogram, which allows the doctor to see what may be causing an abnormal sound and measures how the heart is working.


None of the tests are invasive or painful, although some anxious cats may be more comfortable with sedation. Some cats with severe symptoms may require supplemental oxygen during testing. Some of these tests can be easily done with your local veterinarian, while others may need a veterinary cardiologist to fully diagnose the problem.

Treatment of Heart Failure in Cats
Once the condition has been diagnosed, medications may be used to help the heart function better, normalize the rhythm, or reduce blood pressure. Most of these medications can increase quality and quantity of life. Medications can come in a pill form, liquid form, or in gels that can be applied to a cat’s ears, called transdermal gels.

There are certain heart conditions that may need surgical repair, although these conditions occur infrequently. Most conditions that can be surgically fixed are from birth defects, and these surgeries can be curative.

If heart disease in cats is diagnosed early enough and properly treated, it delays the onset and can even prevent progression to heart failure.

Recovery and Management of Heart Failure in Cats
It is difficult to predict survival time in cats with heart failure. Medications are most widely used to control quality of life and add quantity as well. Modern medications are usually effective with proper patient monitoring. Your veterinarian will likely want to perform bloodwork frequently when medications are first started, to make sure your cat has the proper dose.

Your vet may teach you how to monitor the respiratory rate at home, and may ask for frequent checkups so they can listen to the heart. A prescription diet may be recommended so that your cat is eating what is best for this condition. Once the heart failure is under control, a cat will likely need these medications for the rest of their life, with annual monitoring.

If your cat has other medical conditions such as kidney disease, hypertension, or pulmonary disease, it can make treating the heart failure more complicated.

Many cats can recover from heart failure, but they need to be treated for life. Topics such as long-term prognosis, any additional medical conditions, long-term monitoring, and ease of medicating your cat should be discussed with your veterinarian to determine the best action plan.

 
 Heart Failure in Cats FAQsCan a cat recover from heart failure? Yes. Cats can recover from heart failure, but most require lifelong medication. 
What are the signs of heart failure? Coughing, lethargy, rapid respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, and exercise intolerance can all be common signs of heart failure.
What are the final stages of congestive heart failure in cats? The final stages of heart failure will result in difficulty breathing and coughing. If left untreated, heart failure can result in death. 
Is heart failure in cats painful? Heart failure is not believed to cause acute pain, but it can cause your cat to become very lethargic and have difficulty breathing.

393,"Heart Failure, Congestive (Right-sided) in Cats","Congestive Heart Failure (Right-sided) in Cats

Right-sided congestive heart failure occurs when the heart fails to pump blood at the rate required to meet the basic needs of the body. While it is not curable, there are treatment options that can improve the quality of life for your cat.
 
Symptoms
 
All organ systems in the body can be affected by congestive heart failure. Common signs include weakness, lethargy, difficulty breathing, an enlarged liver, and abdominal distension. Upon physical examination, several signs of disease may present, including jugular vein distention, heart murmur, and rapid, shallow breathing.
 
Causes
 
Heartworms are one of the causes for congestive heart failure, but in some cases, congenital heart failure stems from hereditary causes. In other cases, a weak heart muscle can cause congestive heart failure.
 
Diagnosis
 
A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Other diagnostic tests include heartworm testing and fluid analysis to determine the cause. In addition, you will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily.
 
Additionally, if there is any information you can give about your cat's familial line, it can help your doctor to pinpoint the origin of the heart condition. Your veterinarian will need to differentiate between all of the different causes for the heart failure when examining your cat.
 
  
 
Treatment
 
Unless the condition is severe, your cat will most likely be treated on an outpatient basis.  Some of the treatment options that are used to treat this condition include a restriction on activity and a reduction of sodium in the diet. In some cases, surgery will be required. If there is a build up of fluid in the abdomen or chest, a technique called tapping can be used to remove some of the excess fluid.
 
Living and Management
 
Following treatment, it is important to administer the full course of prescribed medication and observe any abnormalities in your cat's behavior. It will also be necessary to monitor your cat's kidney health. This disease is not curable, so ongoing management will be required.
 
Prevention
 
Preventing right-sided congestive heart failure is dependent on the underlying cause of the disease. For example, if heartworms are causing the heart disease, you will need to ensure that your cat is taking heartworm medication regularly, and that you revisit your veterinarian for routine wellness checkups.","

394,"Heart Failure, Congestive (Left-sided) in Cats","Congestive Cardiomyopathy (Left-sided) in Cats

The heart has four chambers: two chambers at the top, the right and left atria; and two chambers on the bottom, the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart collects blood from the body and pumps it into the lungs, where the blood is oxygenated. The oxygen rich blood is then collected by the left side of the heart, and from there it is pumped out into the body's various organs.

Congestive left-sided heart failure refers to a condition in which the left side of the heart is not able to push blood through the body efficiently enough to meet the metabolic needs of the body, and frequently results in blood pooling in the lungs. Low blood output from the heart causes tiredness, exercise intolerance and fainting.

Symptoms and Types


    Weakness
    Exercise 	intolerance
    Trouble 	breathing
    Cat 	stands in unusual positions to relieve pain
    Increased 	heart rate
    Crackles 	heard when listening to the lungs

    Gums 	stay pale longer than a few seconds when pushed upon with a finger
    Possible 	heart murmur
    Weak 	pulses on the insides of the cat's thighs


Causes

Muscle failure of the left ventricle (the left lower chamber of the heart):

    Parasitic 	infection (e.g., heartworm infection, but this is rare)
    Inactive 	thyroid (rare)
    Overactive 	thyroid (rarely causes pump failure; more commonly causes high blood 	output failure)

 
Pressure overload of the left heart:

    High blood pressure throughout 	the body
    Narrowing 	of the aortic artery (leads directly out of the heart)
    Left 	ventricle tumors (rare)

 
Volume overload of the left heart (the mitral valve on the left side of the heart, separating the left atrium from the left ventricle):

    Mitral valve abnormal 	development
    An 	abnormal hole in the wall dividing the ventricles (two bottom 	chambers of the heart)


Difficulties filling the left heart with blood:

    Fluid filling the sac around the 	heart so that it has trouble beating
    Restrictive 	inflammation of the sac around the heart
    Restrictive 	heart disease
    Heart 	disease causing the heart to enlarge
    Left 	atrial masses (e.g., tumors and blood clots)
    Pulmonary 	blood clot
    Mitral 	valve narrowing (rare)

 
Heart beat rhythm disturbances:

    Slow heart rate
    Increased 	heart rate

 
Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history, onset of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A blood chemical profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel will be ordered to check the underlying cause of the heart disease and its severity. Your veterinarian will also draw blood from your cat to check thyroid function.

Imaging studies can be used to gain a further understanding of your cat's heart condition. X-ray and ultrasound imaging may be used, as well as electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recordings for examining the electrical currents in the heart muscles. These recordings may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).

  

Treatment

Treatment will depend on the exact underlying cause of the cardiac disease. Most patients suffering from left-sided congestive heart failure can be treated on an outpatient basis.  However, if your cat is having trouble breathing it should be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) in an oxygen cage. Your veterinarian will also recommend hospitalization if your cat is presenting with very low blood pressure.

Surgical intervention may benefit select patients with congenital defects, such as malformations of the heart that were present at birth, and some forms of congenital and acquired heart valve disease.

Your veterinarian will also prescribe medications for the heart, if appropriate, and will advise you in a diet and exercise plan that will keep your cat's blood pressure down and relieve pressure on the heart muscle, while hopefully strengthening its ability to pump blood.
 
Living and Management

Left sided congestive heart failure is an incurable disease. Your cat will need to have its activity restricted to some extent to relieve pressure on the heart. While may cats do spend a lot of time resting, if your cat is still highly active, even with this condition, you may need to put some barriers in place for your cat's well being (such as intermittent cage rest, or creating an environment for your cat that limits jumping and running). Your cat should also be fed a moderately sodium-restricted diet that is high in nutrients. This diet may be changed to a severely sodium-restricted diet if the disease worsens, but your veterinarian will determine if this is appropriate. Diet changes should only be made with a veterinarian's approval."," and Types

395,Heart Disease of the Sinus Node in Cats,"Sick Sinus Syndrome in Cats

The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart's contractions by firing off electrical surges. One of the disorders that can affect the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node is called sick sinus syndrome (SSS).

This disorder complicates conduction of the electrical impulse out of the sinus node and the specialized conduction system of the heart. Secondary pacemakers, such as the muscle fibers of the sinus node, will also be affected by sick sinus syndrome. (Note: the body's natural pacemakers are responsible for setting the pace for the heart's rhythm and generating the electrical impulses within the muscle tissue.)

Any irregular contraction of the heart (arrhythmia) will be visible on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, in which the heart beats too slowly, and then too quickly, is a variant of sick sinus syndrome. Clinical signs of sick sinus syndrome in cats will become apparent when organs begin to dysfunction because they are not receiving a normal amount of blood supply.

Symptoms and Types

If your cat tends to be fairly inactive under normal circumstances, it will take longer for symptoms of sick sinus syndrome to become apparent. When symptoms do show, those that will generally present are:


    Weakness
    Fainting
    Fatigue
    Collapse
    Seizure
    Abnormally fast or abnormally slow 	heart rate
    Pauses in 	the heart rhythm
    Rarely, sudden death


Causes

Some of the suspected relationships to SSS are genetic, however, the causes for this condition are mostly unknown. One possible cause is when there is a heart disease that is cutting off the blood supply to or from the heart, disrupting normal heart function and electrical functionality. Cancer in the thoracic or pulmonary (both refer to the chest) region may also lead to SSS.



Diagnosis

A complete physical exam will be performed by your veterinarian. It will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to verify proper organ function. You will be asked to provide a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history and onset of symptoms, and possible incidents or recent health conditions that might have precipitated this condition. The history you give your veterinarian may provide clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily.

In order to to assess sinus node function, a provocative atropine response test may be done. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action (output of electrical impulses) of the SA Node.

An ECG may be indicated in certain breeds that are predisposed to SSS, as these same breeds are often predisposed to other diseases of the heart valves (the valves that separate the four chambers of the heart). Hence, if there is a heart murmur, disease of any of the heart’s valves should first be ruled out.

Treatment

Only cats showing clinical signs need treatment, and only cats requiring electrophysiologic testing of the heart, or implantation of an artificial pacemaker will need to be hospitalized. Attempts to manage an abnormally fast or abnormally slow heart rate, without prior pacemaker implantation, carries a significant risk of worsening the extremes of the abnormal heart rate syndrome.

Living and Management

You will need to keep your cat's physical activity to a minimum while it is healing from this condition. Encourage rest in a quiet, non-stressful environment as much as possible, away from other pets or active children. Cage rest may be recommended for the interim. Although therapy for SSS may appear to work at the beginning of treatment, medical therapy commonly does not have long term benefits. The only solution in these instances is surgical correction."," and Types

"
396,Heart Disease in Cats,"What Is Heart Disease in Cats?
Heart disease, also called cardiomyopathy, ultimately affects the ability of the heart to contract, the strength of those contractions, and the overall amount of blood distributed to the body. 

The feline heart is a muscle made up of four chambers—two atria and two ventricles. The atria serve as receptacles for blood entering the heart, from the lungs on the left side and the body on the right side. From there, blood is pumped into the ventricles and then either flows into the lungs from the right side to pick up oxygen or out from the left side into the aorta (the body’s largest artery) to deliver oxygenated blood to the body. 

Because the heart is a muscle, doing any work outside of its normal job causes it to thicken and become enlarged. As the muscle walls thicken, they become less elastic and less able to relax, preventing the ventricles from filling up with adequate blood.

As a result, the blood backs up into the lungs and heart failure develops. The thickening that occurs can also lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) as well as the development of clots.

Check your pet’s symptomTypes of Heart Disease in Cats
Heart disease in cats can occur as the result of many different abnormal processes in the heart, such as abnormal rhythm, abnormal heart muscle, abnormal contraction, valve disease, or some combination of the above.

Heart muscle disease has traditionally been classified as either primary (congenital) or acquired.

Primary (congenital, meaning a birth defect)


	
	 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), either with or without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), is the most common form of heart disease in cats. In this disease, the left ventricular muscle walls become thickened.

	
		
		HCM is a progressive disease and SAM occurs when the mitral valve gets “sucked” into the aorta during contraction, causing a temporary blockage, restricting blood flow, and increasing pressure.  
		
	
	


Acquired (developed as cat ages):


	
	Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is often attributed to a nutritional deficiency in the amino acid taurine. DCM is a widening of all heart chambers, which leads to thinner walls and an increased workload of the heart, ultimately with loss of contraction strength and heart failure.
	
	
	Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), where the muscle becomes tough and less flexible; usually the left ventricle is only mildly enlarged; however, the atria are enlarged and mitral valve insufficiency is usually present. 
	
	
	Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), where the right ventricle becomes dilated with thinner walls. This cardiomyopathy often leads to right-sided heart failure.
	
	
	Unclassified cardiomyopathy (UCM) is used as a catch-all term for those diseases that do not fit into any specific category.
	


There are also other types of heart disease that can occur secondarily as a complication of another disease, such as cancer, hyperthyroidism, or hypertension (high blood pressure).
Symptoms of Heart Disease in Cats
Many cats with heart disease can be asymptomatic (show no visible signs), which makes diagnosing the condition challenging. Unfortunately, for some cats, the only symptom is sudden death. Other cats may experience the following:


	
	Abdominal distension
	
	
	Abnormal heart sounds such as murmur, arrhythmia, or gallop rhythm
	
	
	Collapse
	
	
	Cool extremities (cat is cold to the touch)
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Heart failure
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Pale or blue gums
	
	
	Respiratory changes such as increased respiratory rate, open mouth breathing, panting, labored breathing, and cough (rarely)
	
	
	“Stretching” postures
	
	
	Sudden hind limb paresis or paralysis, most often caused by a saddle thrombus (clot) and accompanied with pain and vocalization
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Weak pulses, felt on the inside of the cat’s thighs
	

Causes of Heart Disease in Cats
HCM has been shown to be inherited, often by genetic mutation, in purebred cats such as Maine Coons and Ragdolls, and is more prevalent in male cats. Other predisposed breeds for HCM and heart disease include the Persian, Sphynx, American Shorthairs, and British Shorthairs. Testing for this condition is available through a DNA/genetics test.

 
How Veterinarians Diagnose Heart Disease in Cats
Cats with an underlying heart disease do not always have a heart murmur that can be detected in a routine exam. In fact, about one-third to one-half of cats diagnosed with HCM have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and many cats may sadly only experience sudden death. Therefore, when symptoms are present, it’s critical to have your cat examined by a veterinarian.

Several tests are often recommended to help determine the cause of your cat’s specific heart disease. An echocardiogram, or ultrasound of the heart, is considered the best diagnostic tool, as it can determine the ventricle wall thickness, pressures within the heart, valve conformation and ability, and presence of clots. It is the only method to differentiate the different types of heart disease. 

Additional tests your vet may recommend for your cat include:


	Basic blood and urine laboratory testing: to understand your cat’s overall health and establish a baseline needed for future monitoring and response to treatment.
	Blood pressure and thyroid evaluation: to rule out secondary causes of heart murmur/disease.
	Chest X-rays: to look for heart enlargement and fluid in the lungs.
	Electrocardiogram: to determine the presence of arrhythmias and chamber enlargement.
	Nt-proBNP (proteins produced by the heart) testing: a screening tool to help determine if there is moderate to severe heart muscle disease present.
	Taurine level measurement in your cat’s blood and/or food: to determine if there is a deficiency of this amino acid—a major cause of DCM.

Treatment of Heart Disease in Cats
Treatment will depend on the type and degree of heart disease present, often influenced by the presence of heart failure, degree of thickening, strength of muscle contractions, and the ability of the valves to function.

Your cat will be assessed, a physical exam performed, and supportive care measures taken, which often will include oxygen therapy as well as mild sedation or anti-anxiety medication to minimize stress and slow your cat’s breathing. Thoracocentesis or abdominocentesis, a procedure where fluid is removed from the chest or abdomen, may be necessary to help your cat breathe. 

Medical management often includes some combination of the following:


	
	ACE inhibitors, such as enalapril: to help reduce blood pressure and the heart’s workload.
	
	
	Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin: often utilized in the presence of known clots or to help break down clots.
	
	
	Antiplatelet therapy, such as aspirin or clopidogrel: to help prevent clot formation.
	
	
	Beta blockers, such as atenolol: an antiarrhythmic medication that also helps decrease the heart rate and helps regulate blood pressure.
	
	
	Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem: to relax the heart.
	
	
	Diuretics, such as furosemide: to draw the fluid off the lungs.
	


Dietary management with well-balanced, high-quality food that meets the requirements for taurine or taurine supplementation may be needed. In addition, diets low in sodium such as Royal Canin® Renal Support are typically recommended.

Cats that are diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure) or hyperthyroidism can often be regulated with medications. Hyperthyroidism can be treated with surgery, medication, diet, or radiation. 
Recovery and Management of Heart Disease in Cats
Unfortunately, resolution of an underlying heart disease is not possible in many cats, so it can only be managed as best as possible. Lifespan is variable, as some cats with heart disease can experience a normal life and then die from an unrelated condition. Other cats can die quite suddenly, even with the best of medical care. 

Providing a relatively stress-free lifestyle for your cat is important, as is monitoring for changes in her behavior, appetite, and breathing rate. There are certain phone apps you can use, such as Pet Breath Counter, to document your cat’s respiratory rate and show trends and values over time. (A respiratory rate of greater than 30 while at rest should prompt immediate veterinary attention!)

Medications are often the mainstay of acute and long-term therapy. It is important to never discontinue medication without consulting your veterinarian first.
Heart Disease in Cats FAQsHow long can cats live with heart disease?One study concluded that the average survival time for cats with HCM is about five to six years. For cats with heart failure, the time frame is roughly three to 18 months. It’s important to note that not all cats with heart disease will experience heart failure.
What are the signs of heart disease in cats?Commonly, the signs of heart disease in cats are decreased appetite, lethargy, changes in your cat’s breathing, and abnormal heart sounds like a murmur or arrhythmia. Sadly, sometimes the only sign that may be witnessed is acute collapse and death.
Can a cat recover from heart failure?It is possible for cats to recover. However, heart failure is often a progressive disease and will likely recur. It’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for rechecks and follow-up testing to ensure your cat is on the best course of therapy.

397,Heart Disease Caused by Scarring of the Heart Muscles in Cats,"Restrictive Cardiomyopathy in Cats

A cat's heart is composed of four chambers: the top two chambers are the left and right atria and the bottom two chambers are the left and right ventricles. The valves of the heart are located between the left atrium and the left ventricle (the mitral valve), between the right atrium and the right ventricle (the tricuspid valve), from the left ventricle to the aorta (the main artery of the body, the valve of which is the aortic valve), and between the right ventricle to the main pulmonary artery (the pulmonary, or lung valve).
 
Cardiomyopathy is the medical term for disease of the heart muscle. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the muscle is stiff and does not expand, such that blood cannot fill the ventricles normally. Restrictive cardiomyopathy in cats is characterized by abnormal filling of the chambers of the heart (known as diastolic dysfunction), severe atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular wall thickness and variable abnormal pumping of the heart (known as systolic dysfunction). Scar tissue of the heart muscle layer may be present.  Other heart-muscle disorders, including inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases, may also be present.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Lethargy
    Poor appetite and weight loss
    Fainting
    Impaired movement or paralysis
    Some cats are asymptomatic
    Difficult breathing
    Fast breathing
    Open mouth breathing

        Parasites in the heart
        Thickening of the heart muscle 		with a heart attack
        Diffuse small vessel disease and 		other causes of inadequate oxygen to the heart
    
    

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out other causes of disease. will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.
 
Your veterinarian will also order an electrocardiogram to evaluate the electrical conductivity of the heart’s beat for abnormalities.  X-rays and an echocardiogram are essential in assessing heart disease and its consequences.  X-rays of the lungs should also be taken to check for fluid accumulation.
 
 
 
Treatment
 
If your cat is mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic it can be treated on an outpatient basis. Patients with acute, severe congestive heart failure should be hospitalized for emergency care, and patients with severe breathing difficulty will receive oxygen. Low-sodium fluids may be administered cautiously if dehydration occurs, and a heating pad may be necessary for hypothermic patients. Any life-threatening fluid in the chest cavity will need to be reduced. At home, you will need to maintain a low-stress environment to decrease anxiety for your cat. An enclosed space, such as a room, or if necessary, cage rest, will be best for your cat during its recovery. Keeping activity to a minimum is essential for healing. Protecting your cat from active children, guests, and other pets will help in its recovery as well. If your cat is having trouble eating, hand feeding should be employed. Ask your veterinarian for guidance when choosing which foods will best during the recovery period. If your cat refuses to eat, you may need to have nutrition given intravenously.
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to assess your cat’s response to treatment and to assess resolution of swelling and fluid retention. Bloodwork, x-rays and an electrocardiogram should be repeated at each visit. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat shows signs of trouble breathing, exercise intolerance or weakness."," and Types

398,Heart Defect (Congenital) in Cats,"Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Cats

The aorta is the main artery that feeds oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the body. The pulmonary (lung) artery carries deoxygenated blood to be oxygenated, traveling from the right side of the heart to the lungs. Once the blood has been oxygenated by the lungs, it then returns to the left side of the heart, through the pulmonary veins to be pumped out into the body by the aorta.

In the womb, the fetus’ descending aorta is connected to the pulmonary artery by the ductus arteriosus blood vessel, allowing blood to flow directly from the right side of the heart to the aorta, without stopping for oxygen in the lungs. This is because the fetus gets its oxygen from the mother's bloodstream and does not yet need to have its own blood oxygenated.

Normally at birth, this connection is no longer patent (open). Once a newborn has begun to breath on its own, the pulmonary artery opens to allow blood to flow from the right side heart into the lungs to be oxygenated, and the ductus arteriosus closes. But in patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) the connection remains patent. Consequently, blood is shunted (diverted) in abnormal patterns in the heart. PDA allows blood to flow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, and then to the lungs.

If the shunt is moderate to large, it can cause left-sided congestive heart failure from blood volume overload on the left side of the heart. Less frequently, a large-diameter PDA will cause injury to the blood vessels in the lungs, from the excess amount of blood flowing into the lungs. High blood pressure in the lungs, and reversal of the shunt so that the blood goes from right to left (pulmonary artery to the aorta), as well as the typical PDA shunt direction of left to right (aorta to pulmonary artery) can be expected.

This atypical right to left shunting of a PDA can cause the aorta to carry blood that is low in oxygen, sending a signal to the body to produce more red blood cells (since they carry oxygen), making the blood too thick.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types


    Respiratory 	(breathing) distress:
    
        Coughing
        Exercise 	intolerance
        Increased 	breathing rate
    
    
    Right 	to left shunting PDA:
    
        Hind 	legs are weak during exercise
        Blood 	is thicker than normal, causing:
        Arrhythmias 	(irregular heart beat)
        Right 	to left blood clot
        Pink, 	or bluish gums, and bluish skin around the anus or vulva
    
    
    Possibly 	left-sided congestive heart failure
    Rapid, 	irregular heart beat
    Stunted 	growth


Causes


    Genetic 	predisposition (i.e., birth defect)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The level of oxygen in your pet's blood may also be tested, with samples taken from different locations for comparison.

Visualization of the heart, using radiograph and ultrasound imaging, is very instrumental for an accurate diagnosis of PDA. Often what will be seen in an X-ray is left heart enlargement; right to left (“reversed”) PDA will show a heart of normal size on an X-ray.



Treatment

The cat may be given oxygen therapy, nitrates, and cage rest. When your pet has regained stability, it will be scheduled for surgery as soon as possible.

Cats with right to left shunting PDA should never have surgical correction.

Living and Management

Cats with a normal left to right PDA shunt can be treated normally after they have been allowed two weeks to recover from their surgical correction.

Prevention

Because this trait is genetically transmitted, cats that have had a PDA should not be bred. The best way to avoid this is to have your pet spayed or neutered, and to make sure that you know your cat's hereditary history."," and Types

399,Heart Cancer (Hemagiosarcoma) in Cats,"Hemangisaroma of the Heart in Cats

A hemangiosarcoma of the heart is a tumor that originates in the blood vessels that line the heart. Hemangio refers to the blood vessels and sarcoma a type of aggressive, malignant cancer that arises from the connective tissues of the body. A hemangiosarcoma may originate in the heart, or it may have metastasized to the heart from another location in the body.

This tumor often will go undetected until complications arise. Because a hemangiosarcoma arises from the blood vessels, when it reaches an unsustainable size it will burst, often resulting in life threatening internal bleeding. Other typical symptoms relate to the size of the tumor interfering with the heart's ability to function. The pumping of blood into or out of the heart organ may be blocked or slowed, resulting in an irregular heart rhythm; the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart may become filled with blood due to burst vessels, or with fluid that places restrictive pressure on the heart; or there may be a responsive abdominal swelling that puts pressure on the heart and other organs. In addition, the blood loss may lead to a regenerative anemia, with concurrent symptoms that can confound the initial diagnosis.

Symptoms and Types

Most symptoms are seen related to complications affecting heart rather than tumor itself.


    Difficult breathing
    Accumulation of fluid within 	abdominal cavity - visible abdominal distention
    Accumulation of fluid within 	thoracic (chest) cavity
    Sudden loss of 	consciousness/fainting (syncope)
    Inability to perform routine 	exercises
    Trouble with coordination (ataxia)
    Irregular heart beats/arrhythmia
    Enlargement of the liver
    Lethargy
    Malaise/depression
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Weight loss


Causes

The exact cause is still unknown.

Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any incidents of ill health, behavioral changes, or accidents that have recently taken place. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being primarily affected and which organs are being affected secondarily. Your cat's age, breed, and the outward symptoms that are presenting will be the initial signals for a rough diagnosis.

Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The blood tests may reveal anemia, as often the blood loss will lead to a state of regenerative anemia, where the body is lacking in sufficient red blood cells, but is still capable of producing more of them – though it may not be able to keep with the demand.

Your veterinarian will want to take fluid samples from both the abdomen and the chest, by abdominocentesis and pericardiocentesis respectively, for cytological analysis. This can also be used to remove excess fluid so that your cat is more comfortable. Blood found in the fluid sample is a frequent sign of hemangiosarcoma, and failure of clotting in the blood when it is drawn is another telling indication, since the body is working hard to maintain its blood balance and is using the blood clotting factors too rapidly.

An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for examination (biopsy).

Visual diagnostic methods, such as x-rays and ultrasound of the thoracic (chest) and abdominal cavities may reveal variations in cardiac size and structure. Echocardiography is the most valuable tool for making accurate diagnosis. It will confirm the presence of fluid, structural abnormalities in the heart, the presence of a tumor mass or clot, and other aspects of tumors within the heart.
  
  

Treatment

This tumor is very difficult to treat as it tends to rapidly metastasize to different locations in the body. Treatment involves treating both the primary disease as well as the complications that have arisen due to the tumor. Chemotherapy is often recommended for slowing the progression of metastasis, but this alone will not stop the disease spread. Because of the vulnerable nature of the location of this sarcoma, it is often neither practical or even possible to recommend surgery with any hopes of success. Your veterinarian may drain the fluid that has accumulated within the thoracic and/or abdominal cavity, and pain medications will be prescribed by your veterinarian to relieve your cat's discomfort.

Unfortunately, this disease has a poor prognosis, and even successful treatments may only add months to your cat's life.

Living and Management

The location of this tumor (heart) makes it especially life-threatening, so the prognosis is very poor in most patients. In almost all cases, tumor metastasis has already taken place into the lungs at the time of diagnosis, making treatment more difficult. Even after surgery, recurrence is common. The life expectancy for affected animals is less than six months.

Watch for symptoms associated with recurrence and involvement of other body sites. If you notice your cat having difficulty breathing, sudden behavioral changes, which may indicate metastasis to the brain, or any other symptoms, call your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a pain protocol for your cat, as well as a diet that is especially designed for cancer patients.

Consult your veterinarian for advice on making your cat as comfortable as possible, as end of life arrangements may need to made as the hemangiosarcoma progresses."," and Types

400,Heart Block or Conduction Delay (Right Bundle) in Cats,"Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) in Cats
 
Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB) is a heart defect in the electrical conduction system in which the right ventricle (one of the cat's four heart chambers) is not directly activated by the electric impulses through the right bundle branch. RBBB may be complete or partial in nature; however, it is not as frequent as left anterior fascicular block.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to RBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect.
 
Causes
 
Although it may be present in normal cats, a right bundle branch block is more often associated with congenital (present at birth) heart disease(s). Other typical causes for the defect include:
 

    Chronic valve disease with fibrosis
    Heart surgery to correct cardiac defect
    Injury involving heart
    Tumor(s)
    Parasitic infection (e.g., heartworms)
    Cardiomyopathy
    Formation of clot in blood vessel (thromboembolism)
    Abnormally high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia), especially in cats with urethral obstruction

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific. However, biochemistry profile may show high levels of potassium.
 
RBBB is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart and right-side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography, meanwhile, may show masses and other abnormalities. If heartworms are the underlying cause, they also may be identified in diagnostic procedures



Treatment

Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause.
 
Living and Management
 
This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, RBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block.
 
You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the cat's response to treatment. No diet modifications are necessary, unless required to manage underlying condition."," and Types
 
Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to RBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect.

401,Heart Block or Conduction Delay (Left Bundle) in Cats,"Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) in Cats

Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) is a defect in the heart’s electrical conduction system. It occurs when the left ventricle (one of the cat's four heart chambers) is not directly activated by the electric impulses through the left posterior and anterior fascicles of the left bundle branch, causing the deflections in the electrocardiographic tracing (QRS) to become wide and bizarre. LBBB may be complete or partial in nature.

Symptoms and Types

Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to LBBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect.
             
Causes


    Cardiomyopathy
    Cancerous tumors
    Direct or indirect cardiac trauma (e.g., hit by car and cardiac needle puncture)
    Narrowing just below the aortic valve, which supplies the body with oxygenated blood (subvalvular aortic stenosis)
    Replacement of heart muscle with scar tissue (fibrosis)
    Ischemic cardiomyopathy (i.e., hardening or thickening of the coronary arteries, death of heart muscle due to lack of oxygen)


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific.

Left bundle branch block is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart without left-side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography may also show masses and other abnormalities, while Holter monitoring may reveal intermittent LBBB.



Treatment

Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause.

Living and Management

This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, LBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block.

You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the cat's response to treatment. No diet modifications are necessary, unless required to manage underlying condition."," and Types

402,Heart Block or Conduction Delay (Left Anterior) in Cats,"Left Anterior Fascicular Block in Cats
 
Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB) is a condition that affects the heart's conduction system, which is responsible for generating electrical impulses (waves) that propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart muscles to contract and pump blood. If the conduction system is disrupted, not only will contraction of the heart muscles be affected, but the timing and frequency of heartbeats too.
 
This is the most commonly described form of bundle branch block in cats.
 
Symptoms and Types


There are no specific symptoms related to this condition itself, rather, related to the underlying cause of the LAFB.
 
Causes
 

    Heart surgery
    Electrolyte abnormalities
    Heart problems (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular septal defect, aortic valvular disease, etc.)

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may reveal electrolyte imbalances.
 
Electrocardiography, however, remains the most important tool for diagnosis. Your veterinarian will record your cat’s electrocardiogram (ECG) and compare it with a normal ECG to see if any abnormalities are present. Further evaluation of the heart is usually done with echocardiography. This helps in the diagnosis of underlying heart disease or problem, and the extent of heart involvement.
 
Your veterinarian will also take X-rays of both the thoracic and abdominal regions to see if there are any abnormal masses, tumor, foreign body, and/or abnormal heart position.

 


Treatment
 
The form of treatment recommended for your cat grossly depends on the diagnosis and may vary patient to patient. Therefore, correctly diagnosing the underlying cause of the LAFB is paramount.
 
Living and Management
 
Prognosis and follow-up exam schedules varies greatly depending on the underlying disease. However, in cases of severe or advanced heart problems or cancer, prognosis is not good. Consult with your cat's veterinarian in all cases."," and Types


There are no specific symptoms related to this condition itself, rather, related to the underlying cause of the LAFB.

403,Heart Block (Mobitz Type I) in Cats,"Atrioventricular Block, Second Degree–Mobitz Type I in Cats

Second-degree atrioventricular block occurs when the electrical conduction within the AV node is delayed. 

The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. The atria, the two upper chambers of the heart that receive  and send out blood, are prompted into action by the SA node's electrical impulse, which then activates the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node conducts the normal electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, coordinating the mechanical activity so that the atria have forced the blood down into the ventricles before the ventricles contract to send the blood out into the body through the pulmonary artery and aortic artery.

Most cats with this condition show no signs, appearing to be in perfect health. Low calcium levels and certain drugs (e.g., digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, pilocarpine) may predispose some cats to second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1.  Second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1 can also be brought about by diseases unrelated to the heart. This condition is uncommon in cats, but has been documented.

Symptoms and Types

    Certain drugs can affect functioning of the AV node

 
Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam, with a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count. A thorough history from you will allow your veterinarian to rule out masses, gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease. X-rays may help detect some of these disorders as well. An atropine response test, which increases the firing action of the sinoatrial node and conduction of the AV node will indicate if the disease is originating from the heart. 

An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat).
 


Treatment

Treatment will vary depending on the underlying disease causing the second-degree–Mobitz Type 1 atrioventricular block. Cats that are diagnosed with this condition are often given a guarded prognosis, as the condition will progress without intervention. A pacemaker may be necessary.
 
Living and Management

Your veterinarian will guide you through a health plan for your cat that emphasizes the necessary diet and activity guidelines that will effectively treat the underlying cause of disease, if one is present."," and Types

404,Heart Block (Mobitz Type II)  in Cats,"Atrioventricular Block, Second Degree–Mobitz Type II in Cats
 
The heart of a cat, like other mammalian hearts, is divided into four chambers. The two top chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. The heart has an electrical conduction system that is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body.

There are two nodes (masses of tissue) present in the heart that play an important role in this conduction system. The sinus node, or sinoatrial (SA) node, is a clustered collection of similar cells located in the right atrium, its purpose being to generate electrical impulses and to serve as the heart's pacemaker. The other node is called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Like the SA node, it is a clustered collection of similar cells situated in the right atrium, close to the ventricle. The AV node receives impulses from the SA node, and after a small delay, directs the impulses to the ventricles. This delay allows for the atrium to eject blood into the ventricle before the ventricular muscles contract. The AV node can also take the place of the SA node as the heart's pacemaker, should the SA node be affected adversely by a pathological condition of the heart.

Second degree AV block in cats is a disease in which the above mentioned electrical conduction system goes off course, as some impulses are not passed down from the atria to the ventricles, thus impairing contraction and pumping functions of the heart muscles. AV block is rare in healthy cats but may be found in older cats.

Symptoms and Types

Some cats remain asymptomatic while other may show the following symptoms:


    Weakness
    Lethargy
    Sudden collapse
    Syncope (fainting)


In cases of digoxin (a drug used to treat many cardiac diseases) intoxication, an animal may show the following symptoms:


    Vomiting
    Poor appetite
    Diarrhea
    Symptoms related to underlying disease


Causes


    Involvement of non-cardiac diseases
    Age related degenerative changes within the cardiac conduction system
    Drug side effects (e.g., digoxin, a drug used to treat many cardiac diseases)
    Cardiac neoplasia
    Infections involving the heart (e.g., bacterial, viral, parasitic)
    Cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease)
    Trauma


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. A previous illness or treatment history is important in these cases. After performing a complete physical examination, your veterinarian will measure your cat's arterial blood pressure to check for hypertension (high blood pressure) related to cardiac disease. Laboratory tests include the standard complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests are of importance in the diagnosis of this problem as there are some biochemical changes that can predispose your cat to AV block. For example, if digoxin toxicity is suspected, the level of digoxin will be measured in your cat's serum. More specific tests may be conducted to evaluate the presence of infectious disease or parasitism. Blood culture/sensitivity tests will show evidence of a type of organism that is involved in infection and its sensitivity to various antibiotics.

Other diagnostic tools that are important for the evaluation of the heart's structural and functional parameters include electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography for measuring the heart's electrical impulses.



Treatment

This disease is not aggressively treated in cats. If the heart rate is being maintained at a level at which the heart can pump an adequate amount of blood for normal body functions, generally no treatment will be required. If an underlying disease is responsible for the AV block, your veterinarian will treat it accordingly.
 
Living and Management

There is no special nursing care that is required for these patients. If symptoms persist, strict cage rest is often recommended. Your veterinarian may also recommend a special diet for your cat if there is an underlying disease requiring dietary restrictions. It should be noted that if there is an underlying cause that is responsible for the AV block, it will need to be treated in order for the problem to be resolved. You will need to talk to your veterinarian about the various options available for treatment.

In persistent cases, medication is not enough for long-term treatment of this problem. For such  a case,  a veterinarian may suggest a permanent pacemaker (a small device that is placed under the skin of the thoracic [chest] cavity to help control an abnormal heart rhythm) for long-term management. You may need to visit your veterinarian frequently for evaluation of your cat's current cardiac health status and progress, as this problem can lead to further serious complications if it is not monitored regularly."," and Types

405,Heart Block (First-Degree) in Cats,"Atrioventricular Block, First Degree in Cats
 
Normally, a heart contraction is caused by an electrical impulse originating from the sinoatrial node, stimulating the atria, traveling to the atrioventricular node and finally to the ventricles. This electrical conduction system is responsible for controlling the heart rate, and generating electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. 



First-degree atrioventricular block is a condition in which the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is delayed, or prolonged. On an electrocardiogram (EKG) this shows as a prolonged PR interval -- the time between the main electrical impulse, called the P wave, and the QRS complex, which is recognized as the heart beat.  
 
First-degree AV block may be found in young, healthy cats due to a high vagal tone (impulses from the vagus nerve that produce an inhibition in the heart beat), or it may be found concurrent with a  degenerative conduction system disease.  

 
Symptoms and Types
 
Most cats with this condition will not display and symptoms. However, if induced by digoxin (heart medication) overdose, there may be a loss of appetite,      vomiting, and diarrhea.
 
Causes
 
Although it may occur in otherwise healthy cats, those on certain prescription medications, such as digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, and pilocarpine, may be predisposed to first-degree AV block. Some other common causes for the condition include:


    Calcium deficiency
    Inflammation of      the heart
    Degenerative      disease of the electrical conduction system 
    Hypertrophic      cardiomyopathy (heart disease common in cats with thyroid tumors) 
    Infiltrative      diseases (tumors, amyloidosis) 
    Atropine (used to      control spasms) administered intravenously may also briefly prolong the PR      interval 


Low calcium, and certain drugs, may also predispose animals to first-degree AV block.  First-degree AV block can also be caused by noncardiac diseases. 



Diagnosis
 
In addition to the full physical exam, your veterinarian will take a complete background history of your cat's health, when the symptoms began and any other symptoms that may point your doctor to the underlying cause. Standard tests include a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count to check for imbalances or infections. 
 
An echocardiogram (EKG) will be conducted to rule out certain types of heart diseases, and X-ray or ultrasound imaging can be used for internal imaging of the heart, confirming the presence of masses, or ruling them out. Gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease are some of the diseases that can lead this disorder, all of which are unrelated (directly) to the heart.  
 
An EKG recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal the exact abnormalities that are taking place in the cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). 

 
Treatment
 
Depending on the underlying disease causing the atrioventricular block, treatment will vary.  
 
Living and Management
 
Your veterinarian will prescribe diet guidelines as necessary to treat the underlying cause of the disease. You will need to follow-up with your veterinarian for regular appointments so that any changes can be addressed immediately. EKGs will be taken at each visit to follow the progress of the heart's ability to conduct properly."," and Types

"
406,Heart Block (Complete) in Cats,"Atrioventricular Block, Complete (Third Degree) in Cats 
 
Much like a control center, the heart's sinoartial node (SA) is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate through the atrioventricular (AV) node and into the ventricles, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body.
 
Complete, or third-degree, atrioventricular block is a condition in which all impulses generated by the SA node are blocked at the AV node, leading to independent and non-coordinated beating of atria and ventricles.
 
Complete heart block usually occurs in older cats except those having congenital (born with) heart disease.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Weakness
    Coughing
    Difficulty breathing
    Inability to perform routine exercise
    Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
    Fainting

 
Causes
 

    Congenital (present at birth) heart defects
    Idiopathic fibrosis (scarring of heart tissue due to unknown cause)
    Inflammation of heart (myocarditis)
    Inflammation of lining of heart (endocarditis)
    Inappropriate enlargement or thickening of heart muscles (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
    Infiltration of heart muscle by some abnormal substance or cancer (amyloidosis or neoplasia)
    Drug toxicity (i.e., digitalis)
    Electrolyte imbalances
    Heart attack (myocardial infarction)
    Lyme disease
    Chagas' Disease

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Cats suffering from infections of the heart will demonstrate high white blood cell count on blood testing, while biochemistry profile may reveal electrolyte imbalances.
 
Your veterinarian will record the electrocardiograph, or ECG, which is extremely beneficial to make an initial diagnosis. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are performed in animals with abnormal ECG finding, and those with symptoms associated with heart issues.
 
 
Treatment
 
The ultimate goal of therapy is to clear the blockage of electrical impulses at the AV node. To achieve this, a special device called a pacemaker is used to resolve the electrical impulse conduction problems and normalize the heart's beating. (Chest x-rays are taken to confirm the proper placement of pacemaker.) Both temporary and permanent pacemakers are available, and your veterinarian will recommend which will work best for your cat. The blockage can be rectified surgically too, but this is often riskier for the cat.
 
Living and Management
 
If your cat has had a pacemaker implanted, he will require extra care as well as cage rest. Typically, permanent pacemakers are placed in a pocket created surgically under the skin. To prevent the pacemaker from moving, a bandage is applied over the surgical wound for three to five days. Because pacemakers are battery operated, a malfunction can occur at any time; the pacemaker may also become infected, dislodged, or run out of battery. In such cases, the cat's heart may again go into a complete atrioventricular block. Therefore, it is vital that you restrict the cat's movements and monitor him for untoward symptoms.
 
Depending on the severity of the underlying disease, the cat's diet may require modifying. In addition, you will need to visit your veterinarian at regular intervals for ECG and chest radiography, which are used to assess proper pacemaker function. Unfortunately, long term prognosis of cats with complete atrioventricular block is very poor."," and Types

407,Heart Beat Problems (Standstill) in Cats,"Atrial Standstill in Cats

If ECG (electrocardiogram) findings identify missing P-waves in the cat's atria, it is probably suffering from a rare heart rhythm disturbance called atrial standstill. A measure of the electrical activity of the atria (the top two chambers in the cat's heart), P-waves that are absent may be an indicator of a more serious underlying disease.

Atrial standstill can be temporary, persistent, or terminal due to complications such as heart failure. Along with absent P-waves, the ECG of the cat may demonstrate a slow heart rate with regular or irregular rhythm.

Symptoms and Types


    Lethargy
    Muscle wasting
    Slow heart rate (bradycardia)
    A spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope)


Causes


    Abnormally high concentrations of potassium in the bloodstream (hyperkalemia)
    Heart disease, especially those associated with the atria (e.g., atrial myopathy, cardiomyopathy)


Diagnosis

Although routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, are conducted on the animal, often atrial standstill is confirmed through ECG (electrocardiogram) findings. Other common findings include abnormally high levels of potassium and sodium in the blood -- both of which are only found with a biochemistry profile. These results may also indicate abnormalities related to other concurrent diseases. Echocardiography, meanwhile, will help your veterinarian diagnose the type of heart disease and the severity of the issue.

  

Treatment

In some cats, atrial standstill is not a life-threatening condition and no hospitalization is required. However, in others it may be serious enough to require immediate intensive care. Such animals typically have an abnormally high blood potassium level or are suffering from severe dehydration. In these cases, intravenous fluid therapy is used to stabilize the animal. If the cat's heart rhythm cannot be rectified by ordinary means, a pacemaker may be surgically implanted into the chest or abdomen. This small medical device helps control the abnormal heart atria activity.

Living and Management

The prognosis of the cat depends on the underlying disease causing the heart rhythym disturbance. If it is corrected quickly and (when present) hyperkalemia is reversed, the long-term prognosis is excellent.

Your cat will require rest in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children, to help control the symptoms of persistent atrial standstill. Even with a pacemaker, however, the symptoms of lethargy and weakness may persist. Cats with pacemakers also require regular follow-up exams and periodic ECGs to monitor the effectiveness of the device and the heart's rhythm."," and Types

408,Heart Beat Problems (Premature Complexes) in Cats,"Atrial Premature Complexes in Cats
 
Under normal circumstances, the heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern. Atrial premature complexes result in an abnormal rhythmic disturbance, where the heart beats prematurely, before the normal timing, or pacing.  
 
Excluding animals born with a congenital heart disease, atrial premature complexes often affect older cats. Atrial premature complexes (APCs) can be seen on an electrocardiogram (EKG) as a premature wave called a P wave. This P wave may be biphasic, negative, positive or superimposed on the previous T wave on the EKG.  
 
There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are the atria (single: atrium), and two bottom chambers are the ventricles. The P wave on an EKG represents the electrical conduction from the sinoatrial node in the heart to and through the atria of the heart. The QRS complex -- a recording of a single heartbeat on the EKG -- following the P wave represents the passing of this impulse through the heart’s ventricles after it passes through the atrioventricular node. The last wave on an EKG reading is the T wave which measures ventricular recovery (from charging) before the next cardiac contraction.
 
An increase in automaticity of atrial heart muscle fibers or a single reentrant circuit can cause a premature P wave to occur. These premature atrial beats begin outside of the sinoatrial node (ectopic) -- the pacemaker of the heart -- and disrupt the normal ""sinus"" heart beat rhythm for one or more beats.  
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Although there may be no symptoms associated with atrial premature complexes, especially in older cats or in cats that are normally not very active, some common signs include:


    Coughing and      trouble breathing
    Exercise      intolerance
    Fainting      (syncope)
    Cardiac murmur
    Irregular heart      rhythm

 
Causes
 

    Chronic heart valve      disease
    Congenital heart      disease (defect from birth) 
    Disease of heart      muscle
    Electrolyte      disorders
    Neoplasia
    Hyperthyroidsim
    Toxemias (toxic      elements in blood)
    Drug toxicity      (for example, overdose of digitalis, a heart medicine)
    Normal variation      in many older animals

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The full physical exam will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and an electrolyte panel.  
 
It is crucial to search for an underlying cause for the heart disease that is bringing about the APCs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Other diagnostic tools, like echocardiograph and Doppler ultrasound, can be used to visualize the heart and its performance (rhythms, velocity of contraction). 
 

Treatment
 
The treatment your veterinarian administers will depend on exactly what kind of heart disease is affecting your cat and how severe it is. There are several different types of medicines that can be used, depending on the type of heart disease present. A drug to dilate the blood vessels (vasodilator) may be prescribed for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and digitoxin may be prescribed to decrease the heart rate and increase cardiac contractility in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. 
 
Living and Management
 
Underlying cardiac diseases must be treated and kept as controlled as possible by your veterinarian. This means that you will need to take your cat to the veterinarian for frequent follow-up appointments. Sometimes, despite drug therapy, some animals will have an increased frequency of APCs, or will deteriorate to more severe signs of heart disease as the underlying disease progresses. 
 
Depending on the underlying cardiac disease, you may need to change your cat's diet to a low sodium diet. Your veterinarian will advise you on the diet and amount of activity your cat will need to be of optimum health."," and Types

"
409,Heart Beat Problems (Fibrillation and Flutter) in Cats,"Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter in Cats
 
There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are called the atria (single: atrium) whereas the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. Valves are provided between each atrial and ventricular pair, each on the left and right side. The valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve, where the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle is called the mitral valve. The heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern.
 
In both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter this rhythm is disturbed and synchronization is lost between the atria and ventricles. Both conditions refer to a rhythm problem that originates in the upper chambers of the heart, that is, the atria. Atrial flutter is often a precursor to atrial fibrillation. In atrial flutter there is a premature electrical impulse that arises in the atria, resulting in a faster than normal heart rate, either regular or irregular in frequency, whereas in atrial fibrillation there is quivering type of contraction of the heart muscles, resulting in a rapid and abnormally paced heart rhythm, also referred to as arrhythmia. In atrial fibrillation the atria beat chaotically, resulting in irregular rhythms of the ventricle as well. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart, a distinct pattern can be differentiated in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Older male cats have been found to be more susceptible to this condition.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Atrial fibrillation is categorized by relevance, including:

Diagnosis
 
After taking a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests will include complete blood tests, a biochemical profile, and urinalysis. It is possible that the results of these tests may not reveal much information related to this disease, but they may be helpful for accessing an overall picture of your cat’s health and reveal other diseases, if present. Additional diagnostic tools include echocardiography (ECG), X-ray imaging, and color Doppler to help in characterizing the type and severity of any underlying heart disease.
 



Treatment
 
Your veterinarian will first diagnose the level of flutter or fibrillation your cat is experiencing, and whether there is an underlying disease of the heart, such as CHF, that is responsible for the atrial arrhythmia. If the heart is beating too rapidly, your cat will be treated medically for the rhythm to be slowed down. If no underlying disease is found to be present, the treatment will be directed towards normalizing the rhythm of heart and getting the sinoatrial node back into sync with the atrioventricular node (AV) node. If the fibrillation is a chronic problem (more than four months), the success rate drops accordingly. Electrical shock therapy may be used to normalize the rhythm is some cases. If an underlying cardiac disease like CHF is present, the treatment will also be directed towards its treatment, along with stabilizing the heart rhythm.
 
Living and Management
 
Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines regarding diet, exercise, rest, medication, and management of your cat at home. In cases of primary atrial fibrillation, recurrence can occur, especially in patients with chronic problems. Observe your cat’s health and call your veterinarian if you notice any symptoms that appear abnormal. In cases of severe cardiac diseases like CHF, a high level of commitment and care will be required on your part for the treatment and management of your cat’s home care. Keeping a diary of all events and staying in touch with your veterinarian throughout treatment period will help you to follow your cat’s progress."," and Types

410,Heart Attacks in Cats,"What Are Heart Attacks in Cats?
Heart attacks, also referred to as myocardial infarctions, are very rare in cats.

As with humans, heart attacks occur in cats when a large blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart. This can lead to changes in breathing and heart rate, weakness, and collapse.

Heart attacks can cause discomfort and pain to cats and are generally caused by an underlying heart condition, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or other systemic illnesses, such as hyperthyroidism.

Heart attacks most commonly happen in cats with pre-existing heart disease. They have a higher risk for blood clots because of the changes in the shape and function of their hearts. Parts of the heart can become enlarged or thickened and less efficient at pumping blood, which means that more blood collects in the heart chambers, which can form clots.

Heart attacks are often fatal, and cats showing signs of this condition should be brought to a veterinarian immediately. 

Because heart attacks in cats are rare, there’s not much research available about survival rates, but cats in serious condition when seen by the veterinarian may not survive.

Symptoms of Heart Attacks in Cats
Many symptoms of a heart attack in cats are nonspecific and can be caused by a variety of conditions.

Taking your cat to a veterinarian for the right diagnosis is important if you notice any abnormal behaviors or symptoms.

Symptoms of heart attacks in cats may include:


	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Changes in heart rate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in behavior, such as hiding or vocalizing
	
	
	Collapse
	


Blood clots in the heart that cause a heart attack may also break off and travel down the aorta (main artery) to cause a blockage in a condition known as saddle thrombus. This can lead to back leg weakness, paralysis, or legs that feel cold to the touch, in addition to the symptoms listed above.

Causes of Heart Attacks in Cats
Heart attacks in cats are caused by underlying diseases. Possible causes include:


	
	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common heart condition in cats. It causes major changes to the walls of the heart and can lead to blood clots, since blood is not pumped through the heart very well. Ragdolls and Maine Coon cats have a higher risk of this condition because of their genetics.
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism is common in senior cats; it causes hypertension (high blood pressure) and can lead to heart disease, both of which can increase the risk of a heart attack. 
	
	
	Endocarditis is inflammation (swelling) of a cat’s heart lining from infection, which can result in blood clots forming within the heart and other blood vessels.
	
	
	Heartworm disease causes major damage to the heart and lungs, increasing the risk for blood clots. Indoor cats are still at risk, since mosquitoes can easily enter homes and spread the disease if the cat is bitten.
	
	
	Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a rare condition in cats that results in abnormal blood clot formation. It’s usually caused by another underlying disease, such as lymphoma.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Heart Attacks in Cats
Since heart attacks are medical emergencies, veterinarians will at first work quickly to stabilize the patient and provide life-saving treatment. Pet parents should let their veterinarians know when symptoms started, if their cat is taking any medications, and if their cat has been previously diagnosed with a medical condition.

Once the cat is stabilized, the veterinarian will try to determine the underlying cause of the heart attack. A thorough physical exam is done to find abnormalities. Testing may include:


	
	Blood work—A small sample of blood is collected to check for signs of infection, inflammation, clotting abnormalities, or internal diseases.
	
	
	X-rays—Pictures of the chest and abdomen may be taken to check for heart enlargement, fluid in the abdomen or lungs, or changes to blood vessels. 
	
	
	Echocardiography—A heart echo is a specialized test that uses sound waves to make detailed pictures of the heart. It’s used to diagnose underlying heart disease.
	


For cats in very poor condition when arriving at the veterinary hospital or who die at home, a postmortem examination is needed to get the right diagnosis.

Treatment of Heart Attacks in Cats
Because a cat having a heart attack is an emergency, treatment is mostly supportive at first. Oxygen therapy, intravenous (IV) fluids, anti-clotting medications, antibiotics, and pain management may be started.

After stabilizing, the main treatment goal is to get rid of the blood clot, which can be done using medications or surgery depending on the location and severity of a cat’s condition. A cat’s chance of recovery is usually not good, even with treatment, because of the seriousness of a heart attack.

Cats who do recover will be sent home on medications specific to the underlying disease. For example, cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may receive beta blockers and ACE inhibitors (medications that decrease blood pressure and treat arrythmias).

Recovery from a heart attack depends on the underlying cause, how quickly treatment is started, and the cat’s overall condition. Supportive care may help a cat having a heart attack if it is diagnosed early. However, heart attacks in cats are often fatal.

Cats that do survive often will have lasting damage to their hearts. This may result in exercise intolerance, weakness, and a failure to thrive.

Cats who have recovered from a heart attack should be kept in low-stress situations to not make extra work for their hearts. Keeping them separated from other household cats, or dogs if they do not get along, and keeping a consistent routine at home is helpful.

Pet parents should bring their cats to all veterinary follow-ups during their recoveries.

Prevention of Heart Attacks in Cats
Keeping your cat healthy with regular preventative veterinary care is important to catch diseases that can cause heart attacks.

During routine wellness visits, veterinarians can run blood work to check for signs of inflammation, infection, and metabolic diseases, such as hyperthyroidism. They are also able to complete a physical exam and listen to your cat’s heart and lungs to find issues that call for more testing or treatment.

Cats should be kept current on heartworm preventatives, such as Bravecto® Plus, year-round to prevent heartworm disease that can damage the heart and lungs.

Many symptoms of a heart attack in cats are nonspecific and can be caused by a variety of conditions.

Taking your cat to a veterinarian for the right diagnosis is important if you notice any abnormal behaviors or symptoms.

Symptoms of heart attacks in cats may include:


	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Changes in heart rate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in behavior, such as hiding or vocalizing
	
	
	Collapse
	


Blood clots in the heart that cause a heart attack may also break off and travel down the aorta (main artery) to cause a blockage in a condition known as saddle thrombus. This can lead to back leg weakness, paralysis, or legs that feel cold to the touch, in addition to the symptoms listed above.

411,Heart (Aortic) Valve Narrowing in Cats,"Aortic Stenosis in Cats
 
The narrowing of the aortic valve, which controls the blood flow from the left ventricle (one of the cat's four heart chambers) to the aorta ventricular outflow tract, is a congenital (present at birth) defect called aortic stenosis. It is a serious health concern that may lead to various complications.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
There are three types of three types of aortic stenosis: valvular (present at the valve), subvalvular (present below the valve), or supravalvular (present above the valve). The defect typically develops over the first few weeks to months of life; however, symptoms may appear at any age, depending on the severity of obstruction. Some of the more common symptoms include:
 

    Sudden loss of consciousness (syncope)
    Congestive heart failure
    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
    Abnormal lung sounds

 
Causes
 
In most cases, cats are born with the this heart defect. However, some develop the aortic obstruction due to bacterial endocarditis.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, often revealing abnormal heart sounds (murmurs), an indication of irregular heart valve function. However, murmurs are are not always a sign of disease, especially in young animals, as they may occur due to pain, fever, or excitement. Your veterinarian will correlate the findings with other symptoms to determine if the murmur is abnormal. 
 
The veterinarian may also conduct several laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, though the results are usually normal. Chest X-rays, meanwhile, may reveal an enlarged heart, especially on the left side of the organ. And in cats with congestive heart failure, abnormalities may be detected in the lungs.
 
For a more detailed evaluation of the heart and related structures, the veterinarian may use echocardiography, which may reveal thickening of the left ventricle wall and aortic valve. In some cats, echocardiography may reveal a dilated aorta due to stenosis, resulting in abnormal blood flow.
 

 
Treatment
 
The treatment and management guidelines are controversial and vary among experts. However, most agree the aim of therapy is to treat the complications related to the defect. To truly “cure” the cat, open heart surgery is required to repair (valvuloplasty) or replace the valve. However, the prognosis of cats that undergo surgery is not favorable, and therefore not usually attempted.
 
Catherization may also be used to widen the narrowed vessels, but the procedure does not demonstrate survival advantages for cats with severe forms of the disease.
 
Typically, broad spectrum antibiotics are given to cats with aortic stenosis due to the increased risk of developing bacterial infections in the heart.
 
Living and Management
 
The overall goal for you and the veterinarian is to minimize the cat's symptoms, prevent complications, and improve its quality of life. Activity should be immediately restricted to prevent complications (sometimes fatal) due to overexertion. Low sodium diets will also be recommended for cats with congestive heart failure.
 
Affected animals shouldn’t allow breeding or preferably neutered. You’ll need to closely watch your cat at home for abnormal signs and inform the veterinarian immediately if and when they occur. Cats with mild forms of aortic stenosis may live a “normal” lifespan without any treatment. However, those with severe forms of the defect have a poor prognosis, even with treatment. Regardless of the severity, many veterinarians will recommend against breeding an animal with this heart defect."," and Types

412,Heart (Aortic) Blood Clot in Cats,"Aortic Thromboembolism in Cats



Aortic thromboembolismis a common heart condition which results from a blood clot dislodging within the aorta, leading to the interruption of blood flow to tissues served by that segment of the aorta. Therefore, complications arising in the aorta can be very serious.



Aortic thromboembolism, also referred to as saddle thrombus, is more common in cats in comparison to dogs, and it is believe to be hereditary in nature. And although mixed breed cats are most commonly affected with this condition, the Abyssinian, Birman, and ragdoll are all known to also suffer from aortic thromboembolism. In addition, male cats are twice as likely to suffer from this heart condition than females.



Symptoms and Types




	Vomiting
	Paralysis
	Pain (especially in the legs)
	Abnormalities with gait and/or lameness
	Difficult breathing (e.g., tachypnea)
	Unusual barking or anxious temperament
	Bluish or pale nail beds and food pads
	Hypothermia




Causes



In addition to various forms of cardiomyopathy (i.e., dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, etc.), infections of the bloodstream (e.g., septicemia) are common causes for aortic thromboembolism.



Diagnosis



You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, urinalysis, and biochemistry profile -- which may show abnormally high creatine kinase enzyme level due to muscle damage. Moreover, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are typically found in cats with aortic thromboembolism due to muscle and liver damage.



Cats under stress may have abnormally high level of glucose in the blood. Mild increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine may also be present due to low cardiac output and possibly due to presence of blood clot in a kidney. In some cats, electrolytes imbalances as well as low levels of calcium and sodium and high levels of phosphate and potassium may be present.



Chest X-rays, meanwhile, commonly show an abnormal enlargement of the heart and a collection of fluid within the lungs and in the pleural cavity. In rare cases, the X-rays may reveal a tumor in the lungs. Abdominal ultrasounds may help your veterinarian identify the exact location of the blood clot, and echocardiography will confirm an abnormal enlarging of the heart, which is a common cause for aortic thromboembolism.







Treatment



Most cats with this condition require immediate intensive care and hospitalization to prevent complete heart failure. Hospitalization is also necessary to minimize the stress and pain associated with this disease. Cats with breathing problems require oxygen therapy to reduce the stress of rapid breathing and to allow achieving required levels of oxygen in the blood.



Thrombolytics medications, which are used to dissolve the blood, are essential for treatment. Cats that do not respond to conventional treatment, however, will require surgery to remove the blood clot. Your veterinarian will also give pain killers to reduce the severe pain associated with this disease.



Living and Management



Unfortunately, the prognosis for most cats with aortic thromboembolism is not good. Even with treatment, clots can again develop and block the aorta. If blood supply to the legs are not restored quickly, permanent muscular abnormalities may develop in the affected limb.



Cats recovering from aortic thromboembolism should not be allowed to move and should be placed in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children. Severe pain is a common symptom associated with this disease and many cats find it difficult to urinate due to problems with their posture. You may need to gently press your cat's bladder to assist in urination. In addition, most affected cats find it difficult to eat and may require new foods to tempt the palate. This lack of appetite (anorexia) may lead to further complications. Seek your veterinarian's advice for dietary changes.



Lastly, closely monitor your cat and watch for bleeding, which may occur due to the type of medications frequently used in the treatment of this disease. If you observe any sort of bleeding, immediately call your veterinarian.



To monitor the progress of treatment, frequent checkups and laboratory tests will be required. If the cat does not respond to treatment, your veterinarian may recommend euthanizing the animal due to the severe complications.

413,Heart and Lung Diseases in Cats,"Endomyocardial Diseases in Cats



Endomyocarditis, or inflammation of the inner heart muscle and lining, is an acute heart and lung (cardiopulmonary) disease that typically develops following a stressful event. It is characterized by interstitial pneumonia, and inflammation of the innermost portion of the heart. Pneumonia is usually severe and commonly results in death.



Endomyocarditis occurs predominantly in males, between the ages of 1 and 4 years. The development of biventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (occuring within both heart chambers) or left heart failure, meanwhile, occurs prior to 6 months of age. Endocardial fibroelastosis is an inherited (congenital) heart disease in which severe fibrous thickening of the muscular tissues within the heart leads to heart failure.  Moderator bands are normal muscular bands in the right lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart that can sometimes occur in the left lower chamber. Excessive moderator bands (EMBs) is a rare and unique pathologic disease. EMBs can be seen at any age.



Symptoms and Types



Endomyocarditis


	Shortness of breath following a stressful event in a young, healthy cat
	Respiratory signs usually occur 5–21 days after the event
	In 1 report, 73% of cases occurred between August and September




Endocardial Fibroelastosis and EMB


	Heart gallop
	Systolic murmur, reversal of blood flow through heart valves
	Shortness of breath and increased lung sounds, or crackles
	Weakness or paralysis with weak or absent pulse
	Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) is possible




Causes



Generally, the causes for endocardial fibroelastosis or endomyocarditis are uknown. Risk factors for endomyocarditis include stressful incidents, such as anesthesia (commonly associated with neutering or declawing), vaccination, relocation, or bathing. Endocardial fibroelastosis, meanwhile, may be due to genetic factors; it is often seen in Burmese and Siamese cats.









Treatment



Endomyocarditis


	No one standard therapy to date
	Small percentage of cats have survived on long-term therapy
	Supportive care with oxygen and ventilation




Endocardial Fibroelastosis and EMBs


	Oxygen therapy via cage delivery is least stressful
	Lung membrane tap if necessary




Living and Management



Expected Course and Prognosis:


	Endomyocarditis — Poor, although some animals survive; endomyocarditis may progress to left ventricular endocardial fibrosis
	Endocardial fibroelastosis and EMBs — medical treatment may prolong life, but recovery is unlikely."," and Types

414,Heart and Carotid Artery Tumors in Cats,"Chemodectoma in Cats
 
Aortic and carotid body tumors, classified as chemodectomas, are generally benign tumors that grow from the chemoreceptor tissue of the body. These are the tissues most sensitive to chemical changes in the body, such as oxygen content and pH levels in the blood. While chemoreceptor tissues can be located throughout the body, chemodectomas mainly affect the chemoreceptor organs: the aorta and the carotid organs (i.e., heart and carotid artery). 


 
Chemodectomas are rare in cats, but when they do occur, older cats tend to be more predisposed. However, there does not appear to be a gender or breed predilection for chemodectomas. Given that this is a rare condition in cats, aortic tumors are more common than carotid tumors, but metastasis to other organs appears to be more common in cats when it does occur. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Aortic body tumors occur on the aortic artery near the base of the heart. They are rarely of a malignant nature; they will grow within the space but not spread to the surrounding organs. These tumors become a health concern when their growth displaces the trachea, when they grow into the adjacent vessels, or when their growth places pressure on the atria or vena cava, impairing their functionality for conveying blood to the body and heart. Symptoms associated with aortic body tumors include:


    Coughing 
    Trouble breathing 
    Symptoms of right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF)
    Weakness, lethargy

 
Carotid body tumors, meanwhile, occur on the common carotid artery near the point of bifurcation -- where the artery splits into the internal and external carotid arteries. These arteries carry oxygenated blood to the head and neck, and are located in the neck. Because of this relation to the major arterial passages, carotid body tumors are often impossible to remove. In the majority of cases, these tumors remain slow growing but benign, and as with aortic tumors, they become a health issue when they invade the spaces of the adjacent blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. In an estimated 30 percent of cases, metastasis may occur into the surrounding organs, such as the lungs, bronchia or lymph nodes, or further into the liver or pancreas. Symptoms associated with carotid body tumors include:




    Regurgitation
    Vomiting 
    Trouble with eating (anorexia)
    Lump in the neck  

 
Other symptoms seen in cats affected by either body tumor type include:


    Severe hemorrhaging due to tumors in the blood vessels (can lead to sudden death)
    Metastasis to local blood vessels (up to 50 percent of cases )
    Organ failure due to cancerous growths (up to 20 percent of cases)



Causes
 
It is suspected that chronic lack of oxygen (hypoxemia) may be associated with chemodectoma development.  
 
Diagnosis
 
After performing a thorough physical exam on your cat and taking a complete medical history from you, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will give some indication of the whether the cancer has spread in the body. If hemorrhaging is occurring, anemia may be present, and if metastasis is taking place, higher than normal liver enzymes may be present in the bloodstream. 
 
Chest X-rays will be used to identify the location of the mass and to check for cancer spread to the lungs or spine. A heart ultrasound will also be performed, and if heart impairment is suspected, an electrocardiogram (EKG) may be used to measure the heart’s ability to conduct electrical signals. If possible, a tissue sample will be taken from the mass for biopsy. This will provide a definite diagnosis.
 
Treatment
 
Unfortunately, the prognosis for cats with either of these types of tumors is grim. It is often very difficult to remove these tumors because of their placement, and they will continue to grow until functioning of the surrounding vessels or organs is impaired to the point of cardiac arrest or organ failure. Cancer treating therapies, such as radiotherapy, can sometimes be used along with surgery to slow down the spread of these cancers. 
 
Living and Management
 
Your cat will need to be reevaluated by your veterinarian at least every three months for chest X-rays, as well as a physical exam to monitor for recurrence or spread of the cancer."," and Types

415,Hair Loss Related to Cancer in Cats,"Feline Paraneoplastic Alopecia in Cats



Feline paraneoplastic alopecia is a cancer related  skin condition. This condition is rare, and generally is a sign of internal tumors. While the link between skin lesions and cancer is unknown, most cats with paraneoplastic alopecia have pancreatic cancer. By the time the skin lesions appear, the cancer may have already spread to other areas (metastasized).



Because this condition is linked to cancer, many parts of the body are affected. There is the initial tumor and any additional cancer that has spread internally, and externally; the skin will then display lesions and cats will lose hair. Weight can also be affected, with some animals refusing to eat (anorexia).



This condition is not linked to a specific breed. Age does appear to be a factor, as the majority of cases seen are between nine and sixteen years of age, with an average age of 12.5 years.

 

Symptoms and Types



There are several symptoms that may be noticed by owners. Individually, the symptoms may be dismissed. But when seen in combination, a visit to the veterinarian should take place quickly. Excessive shedding is common and may be observed, as well as itching and more frequent grooming. A decrease in appetite and weight loss are also signs of a problem. Some cats will develop painful cracks on the pads of their feet and resist walking because of them.



A physical examination will likely involve checking the extent of hair loss, as well as how easily hair falls out. There may be gray spots in the areas of hair loss. The outermost layer of the skin will be examined to determine if it peels. Additionally, the veterinarian will probably check the cat’s footpads for cracks.



Causes



In the vast majority of cases of cats that exhibit paraneoplastic alopecia, the condition is caused by, or at least linked to, cancer of the pancreas (other cancers are possible as well).





Diagnosis



There are many other potential causes of the skin lesions including Cushing’s Disease (hyperadrenocorticism), thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism/hypothyroidism), symmetrical hair loss (alopecia), mange (demodicosis), fungal infection (dermatophytosis), skin fragility syndrome, and others. Due to the wide range of possibilities, it is imperative that your cat be seen by a veterinarian.



Some of the above illnesses can be diagnosed with a simple physical exam, while others require further testing. Endocrine analysis, skin scrapings, biopsies, and ultrasounds are some of the tests that may be employed. These tests will check for cancer and will either confirm or refute the possibility of a different condition.





Treatment



While removal of the tumor is a good step, it may not cure the cat as, in many cases, the cancer has spread. Chemotherapy does not seem to help this condition due to the advanced nature of the disease.



Living and Management



In cases where the animal is terminally ill, the owner can make the animal’s remaining days as comfortable as possible. This generally includes changing their diet to a more healthy alternative. In some cases, the cat may need to be tube fed as well. Unfortunately, death is likely to occur within 20 weeks from the appearance of the skin lesions."," and Types

416,Hair Follicle Tumors in Cats,"Trichoepitheliomas and Pilomatricomas in Cats

There are two types of hair follicle tumors, which arise from cystic hair follicles (follicles that have closed over, like a sac), and, which arise from the cells that produce the hair follicles. Hair follicle tumors are generally benign tumors that originate in the hair follicles in the skin.

Trichoepitheliomas are small benign tumors, often found along a cat's back, shoulders, flank, tail or limbs. Pilomatricomas are rare skin tumors that develop from the hair matrix, where the cells which grow the hair follicles develop and are contained.

Hair follicle tumors should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian. The prognosis for these hair follicle tumors is generally positive, as the majority of the tumors are found to be benign. Amongst breeds, Persian cats appear to have a predisposition to hair follicle tumors.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis.

Samples of the tumor will need to be taken for a close examination of the structure of the tumor. Samples will be taken for histopathologic laboratory analysis, both by fine needle aspirate (fluid sample) and by tissue biopsy. Such an analysis will determine exactly which type of hair follicle tumor is present and whether it is benign or malignant. Although this type of tumor is often found to be benign, it is possible that your veterinarian will find that it is a tumor of a different kind.


Treatment and Care

Your veterinarian will most likely recommend excising the tumor, leaving wide surgical margins to ensure that the tumor has been removed entirely. If the histopathological results show a malignant tumor, your doctor may need to refer you to a veterinary oncologist for further treatment.

Living and Management

It is important to monitor your cat for recurrence of the hair follicle tumors.  If you notice that your cat is developing more of these tumors, contact your veterinarian. Overall, the prognosis for this medical condition is generally excellent, as the majority of tumors are found to be benign."," and Types

417,Gum Disease in Cats,"What Is Gum Disease in Cats?
Gum disease, or periodontal disease, is a dental condition in cats. It causes inflammation of some or all the affected tooth’s supporting structures. Gum disease is one of the most common illnesses in cats.

If food particles and bacteria are allowed to accumulate along a cat's gumline, it can form plaque, which—when combined with saliva and minerals—will transform into calculus (tartar). This causes gum irritation, or a reddening of the gums around a cat’s teeth. This inflammatory condition is called gingivitis. This is an early stage of periodontal disease in cats.

After an extended period, tartar builds up under a cat’s gums and separates it from the teeth. Spaces will form under the teeth, fostering bacterial growth.

Once this happens, a cat has irreversible periodontal disease. This usually leads to bone loss, tissue destruction, and infection in the cavities between the gum and teeth.

Types of Gum Disease in Cats 

Periodontal disease in cats is classified in four stages based upon how the mouth looks during oral examination and in dental X-rays.

All stages of dental disease in cats can cause the gums to bleed. Your cat’s medical treatment will be chosen based on this staging by your vet.


	
	Gingivitis—This stage occurs when there is inflammation of the gingiva, or soft tissues of a cat’s mouth, without attachment loss. Gingivitis does not affect the firm structures (bone).
	
	
	Early periodontitis—Up to 25% attachment loss of the ligament that holds the tooth in a cat’s gums
	
	
	Moderate periodontitis—25% to 50% attachment loss
	
	
	Advanced periodontitis—More than 50% attachment loss
	
	
	Tooth resorption—Destruction of crown and tooth roots, holes in teeth, and intense pain

Symptoms of Gum Disease in Cats
Symptoms of gingivitis in cats include:


	
	Red, swollen gums
	
	
	Bad breath (halitosis)
	
	
	Plaque on the teeth
	
	
	Varying degrees of tarter buildup
	
	
	Painful mouth, which may present as a cat pawing or rubbing their mouth/face
	
	
	Drooling
	
	
	Dropping food
	
	
	Bleeding gums
	
	
	Only eating soft food
	
	
	Turning head excessively while eating
	


Symptoms of periodontitis in cats include all the above, plus:


	
	Loose teeth
	
	
	Tooth loss
	
	
	Decreased appetite or anorexia
	
	
	Gum recession
	
	
	Exposed tooth roots
	
	
	Teeth chattering
	
	
	Tooth resorption
	


Causes of Gum Disease in Cats
Cat periodontal disease can be caused by several factors, though it’s most caused by a bacterial infection. Bacteria under the gumline leads to pain and inflammation of the tissue.

This bacteria accumulation below a cat’s gumline is often partly due to lack of oral care, such as routine teeth brushing. Lack of routine dental cleanings with your vet can also cause gum disease in cats.

There may also be a relationship between having a history of calicivirus infection and severe gingivitis.

Other conditions that may contribute to gum disease in cats include:


	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
	
	
	Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
	
	
	Severe kidney disease
	
	
	Diabetes mellitus
	
	
	Autoimmune disease
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose of Gum Disease in Cats
Your veterinarian will look inside your cat’s mouth for red, inflamed gums. Your vet may press gently on your cat’s gums to see if they bleed easily, which is a sign that a deep dental cleaning—or more—is needed.

If your vet notices any of these signs of gingivitis or gum disease, they will likely recommend that your cat have a dental procedure. Your veterinarian will run some blood work. They will also check your cat’s heart and lungs to ensure it’s safe to put them under anesthesia for the procedure.

Once under anesthesia, the diagnosis of cat periodontal disease involves several procedures. If periodontal probing reveals more than one millimeter of distance between the gingivitis-affected gum and tooth, a cat is considered to have some form of periodontal abnormality.

X-rays are important in diagnosing periodontal disease in cats, as up to 60% of symptoms are hidden beneath the gumline. In the disease's early stages, X-rays will reveal loss of density of the tooth which is presented as a dark area instead of bright white. In more advanced stages, it will reveal loss of bone support around the root of the affected tooth.

Treatment of Gum Disease in Cats
The specific treatment for periodontal disease in cats depends on how advanced a cat’s condition is.

In early stages of gum disease in cats, treatment is focused on controlling plaque and preventing the loss of a cat's tooth. This is achieved through daily brushing with pet-safe toothpaste and vet-prescribed products to minimize the development of plaque. 

Your vet may recommend that the affected tooth is removed. To remove the tooth, your cat will have to go under anesthesia. Blood work and chest X-rays are done before anesthesia to ensure your cat’s safety. Before the procedure, your cat will have to be fasted at least 12 hours to ensure an empty stomach for the procedure to reduce changes of complications such as vomiting and aspiration pneumonia.

Once the affected teeth are removed—in conjunction with oral medications like antibiotics—the gum disease should be resolved.

Recovery and Management of Gum Disease in Cats
Follow-up treatment for periodontal disease in cats consists mostly of maintaining good cat dental care and taking your cat for weekly, quarterly, or biannual checks. Depending on how fast tarter builds up in your cat’s mouth, dental procedures are recommended every six to 12 months.

Ask your vet if they can perform dental cleanings in-clinic. If they can’t, ask where they recommend. Avoid non-aesthetic dental cleanings, as they are not recommended. Ensure that the vet performing the cleaning has the capability to perform dental X-rays.

Dental cleaning procedures for cats often range from $300 to $2,500, depending on the severity of a cat’s gum disease.

Recovery from a dental procedure often requires your cat to wear a recovery collar to prevent them from being able to paw or scratch at the mouth.

Some cats also need to eat canned food or even a special dental diet after the procedure to aide in their recovery. Often antibiotics and/or pain medication are part of the recovery plan.

Your cat’s prognosis will depend on how advanced their gum disease is.

The best way to minimize the adverse effects caused by the disease is to get an early diagnosis, adequate treatment, and proper therapy.

Prevention of Gum Disease in Cats
The best prevention for gum disease in cats is to maintain your pet’s good oral hygiene. Regularly brush and clean their mouth and gums, at least three times per week, every other day.

If trained slowly over time, cats will allow their teeth to be brushed. Training a cat to enjoy their teeth being brushed starts early in kittenhood and should become routine. You can offer your cat a dental treat before and after teeth brushing to ensure that they enjoy the process.

Prescription cat food dental diets are available for those cats who are unwilling to have their teeth brushed.

Cat dental treats, water additives and other products certified by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) are also shown to help reduce plaque and calculus.

Gum disease in cats can be entirely preventable with routine care both at home and with your veterinarian. This can be a very painful condition and can cause further illness if not treated.

If you have questions or concerns about your cats teeth, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian or consider chatting with a veterinary professional at Chewy’s Connect with a Vet.

Is dental disease in cats fatal? Dental disease itself is not fatal—but the consequences of this condition can be.

Dental disease can cause pain which may prompt your cat to stop eating. Cats that don’t get adequate nutrition will start to develop liver failure within about 72 hours of not eating. This occurs from the body using the fat around the liver for energy. Liver failure can be fatal if not treated promptly and aggressively.

Depending on how much liver damage is present, it might not be reversible.

418,Glycogen Storage Disease in Cats,"Glycogenosis in Cats



Glycogen storage disease, also known as glycogenosis, is a rare inherited disorder with various types, all characterized by deficient or defective activity of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing glycogen in the body. This leads to an abnormal accumulation of glycogen, the main carbohydrate storage material in the body which aids short term energy storage in cells by converting to glucose as the body needs it for metabolic requirements. Accumulation of glycogen in the tissues can result in the enlargement and dysfunction of various organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys.



The Type IV classification found in cats is seen in the Norwegian Forest breed. Signs may manifest at five to seven months of age, or in some cases, the disease may manifest in the womb, resulting in a still birth.



Symptoms and Types



In cats, type IV glycogen storage disease is apparent in Norwegian Forest cats, and often results in death before birth. If your cat survives this condition, symptoms can include fever, muscle tremors, and weakness.



Causes



The various forms of glycogenoses all result from some sort of deficiency in glucose-metabolizing enzymes in the body. The types are distinguished by the specific enzyme deficiency. Type IV, the type found in cats, results from a deficiency of the glycogen branching enzyme.



Diagnosis



Diagnostic procedures will vary depending on the symptoms and suspected type of glycogen storage disease at hand. A tissue enzyme analysis and determination of glycogen levels can serve as a definitive diagnosis. Other tests may include urine analysis, genetic testing, and electrocardiography (ECG) to check the electrical output from the heart for changes.









Treatment



Care will vary depending on the type of glycogen storage disease diagnosed and the severity of symptoms. Hypoglycemia may need to be regulated with diet, feeding frequent portions of a high-carbohydrate diet.



Living and Management



Upon diagnosis, your cat will need to be continuously monitored and treated, if necessary, for hypoglycemia. However, there is not much that can be done. Glycogenosis is fatal for most animals, or they are euthanized due to progressive physical deterioration.



Prevention



Because this is an inherited disease, animals that develop glycogen storage disease should not be bred, nor should their parents breed again, in order to avoid the possibility of future cases."," and Types

419,Glucose in the Urine in Cats,"Glucosuria in Cats

Normally, the kidneys are able to reclaim all of the filtered glucose from the urine into the bloodstream. Glucosuria (or glycosuria) is characterized by the presence of glucose into the urine. It is nearly always due to kidney disorders, such as diabetes mellitus.

Symptoms and Types

Glucosuria is categorized as hyperglycemic (260–310 mg/dL ) or normoglycemic, and subcategorized as transient or persistent. Symptoms will depend on the underlying disease, but some possible signs include:


    Diluted urine
    Increased thirst and drinking (polydipsia and polyuria, respectively)
    Renal failure
    Urinary tract disease
    Possible systemic disease (in hyperglycemic glucosuria)                   


Causes

Hyperglycemic glucosuria

    Transient
    
        Stress-related hyperglycemia
        Adverse drug reaction (e.g., epinephrine, morphine, and phenothiazines)
    
    
    Persistent
    
        Systemic disease
        Diabetes mellitus
        Overactive adrenal gland (hyperadrenocorticism)
        Sudden inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis)
        Lesions in the central nervous system (brain, spine, etc.)
        Adrenal gland tumor (pheochromocytoma)
        Progesterone-associated hyperglycemia
        Excessive growth hormone (acromegaly)
        Bacterial infection in the blood (sepsis)
        Glucagonoma (tumor in the pancreas which secretes glucagon, a hormone which increases blood sugar)
        Chronic liver failure
        Etiologic agents such as heavy metal poisons, drugs, and chemicals
    
    


Normoglycemic glucosuria

    Congenital normoglycemic glucosuria
    
        Primary renal glucosuria
        Congenital diseases associated with kidney dysfunction
    
    
    Acquired normoglycemic Glucosuria
    
        Acute kidney failure
    
    




Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to detect any underlying systemic diseases causing the glucosuria -- though often there is too little glucose present in the cat's urine to be detected. Hexokinase- or glucose dehydrogenase-based techniques are recommended for quantification of urinary glucose.

Treatment

The type of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of glucosuria. If a urinary tract infection is present, for example, antibiotics will be employed and adjusted according to the culture. Meanwhile, solutions or medications that may have caused the glucose to appear in the urine should be discontinued immediately."," and Types

Glucosuria is categorized as hyperglycemic (260–310 mg/dL ) or normoglycemic, and subcategorized as transient or persistent. Symptoms will depend on the underlying disease, but some possible signs include:

420,Glomerulonephritis in Cats,"The term glomerulonephritis refers to the inflammation and subsequent dysfunction of the glomeruli -- the small mass of capillaries in the kidney that filters waste products from the blood and into the urine so they can be secreted from the body. The most common cause of glomerulonephritis is the deposition and entrapment of antigen-antibody complexes (such as a toxin or enzyme) within the glomeruli. Moreoever, the disease affects both genders, but occurs in more often in  males.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms may vary depending on the underlying cause, like inflammation, infection, or neoplasia. In some cats, the only presenting symptom may be weight loss and weakness. In fact, many times, the condition is discovered incidental to a routine annual health screening, when increased concentrations of proteins are found in the urine. If the protein loss into the urine is severe, the cat may develop an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites).

In cats suffering from advanced disease with kidney failure, there may be symptoms of increased thirst and frequency of urination, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Those with a severe deficiency of the blood protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia), may suffer from a blockage of the lung's blood vessels, which causes respiratory difficulties or severe panting. High blood pressure, meanwhile, may cause sudden blindness.

Causes


    Inflammation
    Infections
    Idiopathic (unknown)
    Neoplasia (growth of tissue, tumor)
    Diabetes mellitus
    Long-term use of certain drugs


  

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count test are usually not significant. In severe cases, the biochemistry profile may reveal abnormally low levels of blood protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia) and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia). The presence of blood protein albumin and other proteins in the blood may help your veterinarian in making the initial diagnosis. In cats with kidney failure, the urinalysis will reveal corresponding changes in urine.

Creatinine is a waste product normally excreted by the kidneys, and its presence in the urine is measured as a diagnostic indicator of kidney function. Urine protein testing is also performed, as the amount of protein found in the urine can also be used to evaluate and monitor kidney function.

A more specific test calculates the urine protein and creatinine ratio in order to give your veterinarian an idea of the degree of kidney damage. The extent of protein loss in the urine roughly correlates with the severity of the kidney disease. Therefore, measuring protein and creatinine ratio also helps in assessing treatment response and progression or regression of disease.

Diagnostic imaging can also be used for determining how diseased your cat's condition is, and what treatment needs to be applied. These procedures are helpful in the diagnosis of concurrent diseases and in evaluating the kidney size. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound can be used to evaluate the kidneys and other abdominal organs, and can be helpful in performing a less invasive type of tissue collection for biopsy purposes. Your veterinarian may take a kidney tissue sample (kidney biopsy) to rule other causes of kidney failure, such as neoplasia or cancer.

Treatment

As most cases of glomerulonephritis involve an immune reaction (interaction of antigen and antibodies), the most specific and effective therapy is the control and elimination of such an immune reaction. However, finding and treating the exact disease process or antigen that is causing such an immune reactions is not always possible. Moreover, once renal failure has developed, the prognosis is often poor. The overall treatment of this disease depends on the cause and severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will recommend an individualized diet plan for your cat that is tailored toward kidney health. These patients often require low sodium and high quality, low quantity, protein diets. Because most drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, do not give your cat any types of drugs, or change the dosage of any prescribed drugs without consulting your veterinarian beforehand. In follow-up visits, your veterinarian will need to conduct regular laboratory testing in order to monitor the therapy response and progression of the disease, adjusting medications and therapies as necessary."," and Types

421,Glaucoma in Cats,"What Is Glaucoma in Cats?
Glaucoma is a condition where there is an increase in the fluid, called aqueous humor, inside the eye.

Aqueous Humor: Aqueous humor is the fluid that gives eyes their round shape and provides nutrients to the structures inside the eye. There is a balance between enough fluid to support the eye and too much fluid, which can create high pressure inside the eye and damage it due to lack of drainage.

Intraocular Pressure: Increased pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure (IOP), can cause irreversible blindness if not treated quickly. Glaucoma is caused by increased IOP due to lack of aqueous humor drainage.

Types of Glaucoma in Cats

There are two types of glaucoma in cats:

Primary Glaucoma

This is caused by an abnormal aqueous humor drainage ability due to an anatomical abnormality. It is a genetic predisposition that is generally seen in dogs and not commonly in cats.



Secondary Glaucoma

This is caused by a secondary disease that creates a physical barrier to aqueous humor drainage. This barrier may be created by white or red blood cells, cancer cells, an eye lens that is out of place (lens luxation), or an overgrowth of tissue covering the drainage angle due to a chronic eye inflammation called anterior uveitis.

Symptoms of Glaucoma in Cats
Cats that develop glaucoma may have


	Sudden blindness
	Red or cloudy eyes
	Excessive tearing or squinting
	Different-sized pupils
	One eye that looks bigger than the other or that bulges out


Glaucoma is painful, and your cat may act different than normal due to pain. This can look like


	Hiding or avoiding interaction or play
	Sudden aggression
	Sleeping more than normal


Since glaucoma is mainly secondary to other diseases, cats may have signs of illness in other parts of their body which may include:


	Change in appetite
	Weight loss
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea


Causes of Glaucoma in Cats
Secondary causes include:


	Chronic anterior uveitis, or inflammation in the front of the eye, caused by infectious diseases like:
	
		Feline leukemia virus, also known as FeLV (viral)
		Feline infectious peritonitis, also known as FIP (viral)
		Feline immunodeficiency virus, also known as FIV (viral)
		Toxoplasmosis (parasitic)
		Cancers like lymphoma or ocular (eye) melanoma
	
	
	Lens luxation (dislocation)
	Eye trauma
	Fungal diseases
	Sepsis
	Unknown causes (idiopathic)


How Veterinarians Diagnose Glaucoma in Cats
Your veterinarian can easily diagnose cat glaucoma with an eye test called tonometry, which measures pressure inside the eye, or intraocular pressure (IOP). Normal IOP in cats is 15-25 mmHg. Any IOP above normal is considered glaucoma. Sustained elevations in IOP will cause blindness due to damage to the optic nerve and retina.

Treatment of Glaucoma in Cats
In emergency situations where the pressure inside the eye is very high and blindness may occur, your veterinarian may administer:


	Intravenous (IV) medication, called mannitol, to rapidly decrease eye pressure
	Topical treatment to reduce aqueous humor production. This is usually done using an eyedrop medication called dorzolamide, which is sometimes combined with timolol.


Once intraocular pressure is normalized, your veterinarian may conduct other tests to determine the underlying cause, including bloodwork and additional eye tests.

If no underlying cause for the glaucoma can be found with extensive testing, the intraocular pressure cannot be well controlled and the eye is blind, or the cause is eye cancer, then surgical removal of the eye, called an enucleation, is generally recommended.

Uncontrolled glaucoma is painful, and removing the eye provides significant pain relief for your cat. It is also curative for cases of primary eye cancer and can provide a diagnosis of the underlying cause for glaucoma in cats where one could not otherwise be found.

Cost of Treatment for Glaucoma in Cats

Treatment cost for glaucoma in cats depends on the underlying cause and whether it presents as an emergency that needs emergency treatment as described above.

Cats with glaucoma either need lifelong treatment of glaucoma to maintain eyesight and prevent pain, or they may need surgical removal of the eye, as well as treatment for the underlying cause.

Recovery and Management of Glaucoma in Cats
Due to various underlying medical conditions that can cause glaucoma in cats, the long-term prognosis is difficult to generalize.

In cases of infectious diseases or trauma, if the infection or injury can be cured, then the eye may recover.

In cases caused by cancer, if the cancer is only in the eye, surgery to remove the eye is curative. In cases where the cancer is metastatic (in other parts of the body) or with non-curable infections like FeLV or FIV, your veterinarian will prescribe daily medication.

Regardless of the cause, once blindness has occurred, it will not improve unless there is early intervention with either surgery or medication. Most cats will go on to live relatively normal lives especially in cases where only one eye is removed.
Glaucoma in Cats FAQs Can cats recover from glaucoma? Yes, depending on the underlying cause. If the underlying cause can be identified and is treatable, then your cat can either get eye drops to control the glaucoma or may need surgery to remove the affected eye.
What can you do for a cat with glaucoma? If you suspect that your cat has glaucoma, you should take them to your veterinarian or an emergency veterinary hospital as soon as possible for testing and treatment.
What happens if glaucoma is left untreated in cats? Untreated glaucoma will cause irreversible blindness in the affected eye. There may also be other side effects, depending on the reason that the glaucoma has developed.
Is cat glaucoma painful? Yes, glaucoma is very painful. People with glaucoma describe the pain of increased intraocular pressure like a constant migraine headache. Eye drops to reduce intraocular pressure relieve this pain.

422,Gingivitis in Cats,"Gingivitis is considered the earliest stage of periodontal disease, and more than 80% of pets 3 years or older develop some form of periodontal disease. However, gingivitis is reversible with proper care.

Here’s what you need to know about gingivitis in cats and how you can protect your cat’s dental health.


What Is Gingivitis?
Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingiva, or gums.

In the early phases of gingivitis, some plaque is present on teeth and there is a mild redness of the gums, but the gingival surfaces are smooth. Plaque is the result of food, debris, bacteria, dead cells, and mucus that collects on the teeth. Plaque forms within 24 hours on clean tooth surfaces, which is why frequent teeth brushing is so important.

The gums respond to plaque with swelling, collagen loss, and inflammation.

Advanced Gingivitis in Cats

In advanced gingivitis, cats will have moderate-to-severe redness of their gums, irregular gum surfaces, and plaque and calculus (tartar) under their gums and on their tooth surfaces. Calculus forms when calcium in saliva mixes with plaque, making it hard and difficult to remove.

The gingival sulcus, or gum pocket, is the narrow space between the inner wall of the gum and the tooth. As gingivitis develops, the bacteria present in these pockets irritate the gums and release toxins that destroy the gum tissue.

Symptoms of Gingivitis in Cats
Some signs of cat gingivitis include:


	
	Red or swollen gums, especially on the side of the gums facing the inner cheeks
	
	
	Halitosis/bad breath
	
	
	Variable amounts of plaque and calculus on the surface of the teeth
	


Causes of Cat Gingivitis
Plaque and tartar accumulation is the main cause of gingivitis in both cats and dogs. Here are some predisposing factors that can lead to gingivitis in cats:


	
	Old age
	
	
	Crowded teeth
	
	
	Soft food
	
	
	Abnormal chewing habits
	
	
	Not receiving oral health care (no dental cleanings, teeth brushing, etc.)
	
	
	Uremia and diabetes mellitus
	
	
	Autoimmune diseases
	
	
	FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus)
	
	
	FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus)
	


How Vets Diagnose Gingivitis in Cats
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, considering the history of symptoms and possible conditions that might have led to gingivitis.

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and the onset of symptoms, such as:


	
	When the bad breath began
	
	
	What your cat typically eats
	
	
	Whether your cat has had trouble eating/chewing
	
	
	Whether your cat has had any previous health conditions
	
	
	What routines you follow to keep your cat's teeth clean (if any)
	
	
	Which cat dental products you use
	


Part of the physical involves examining your cat's mouth, but your veterinarian may recommend that you make an appointment for a thorough dental exam, which can only be performed under anesthesia and is often combined with a dental cleaning.

Treatment for Cat Gingivitis
Treatment for cat gingivitis involves removing plaque and tartar from all surfaces of a cat’s teeth (including under the gums) and dealing with any predisposing factors and gum damage that may have occurred.

Your veterinarian will check the depth of the gum pockets. They may need to pull any teeth that are infected, severely damaged, or too crowded.

Your veterinarian may also recommend X-rays of the teeth to determine if the gingivitis has progressed to periodontal disease and to look for infection at the tooth root. The tooth surfaces will be polished, and the teeth will be reexamined after cleaning. Other treatments may be necessary based on the condition of your cat’s teeth and gums.

Your veterinarian will teach you how to help keep your cat’s teeth clean home, and you should make appointments for follow-up examinations.

The frequency of dental exams and cleanings will depend on the stage of periodontal disease your cat is diagnosed with. They may be scheduled once a year, or more frequently if your cat has reached a more severe stage of disease.

Preventing Gingivitis in Cats
You can help maintain your cat's oral health care by brushing or rubbing their teeth with a special finger pad using a veterinary toothpaste. It’s best to brush your cat’s teeth every day (at least every other day). Anything less and plaque and tartar can quickly redevelop, causing gingivitis in your cat.

Your veterinarian may also give you a veterinary antibacterial solution to squirt on your cat's teeth or to add to your cat’s drinking water to decrease plaque buildup.

There may be some cat dental care products that can help you maintain your cat’s dental health as well. Good options are listed below.

423,Giardia in Cats,"What Is Giardia in Cats?
Giardia is a single-celled organism classified as a protozoan. It can live in the intestines of cats (and other animals, including dogs and humans) and cause severe gastrointestinal disease. It is spread by fecal-contaminated water, food, or soil.

Giardia is found worldwide and in every part of the United States.

Symptoms of Giardia in Cats
Giardia is primarily a disease that causes a lot of severe, watery diarrhea. Giardia in cats can also cause:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Excess gas
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Decreased energy
	
	
	Frequent trips to the litter box
	


You will probably notice an irritated perianal region and excessive grooming to keep clean, which is unfortunately a source of continual reinfection.



It is also worth noting that cats (and other animals) can have the protozoa present in their intestines and still not show any symptoms. It is not known how often this is the case, as Giardia is not routinely tested for in cats unless they have diarrhea.

Causes of Giardia in Cats
Giardia is a protozoan that must be orally ingested. Cats are infected by the cysts by ingesting stool or contaminated soil (via grooming) or drinking contaminated water. Contaminated food is less often a source of Giardia for indoor cats but can be a source of infection for outdoors cats.

How Vets Diagnose Giardia in Cats
Your veterinarian will gather a complete history and conduct a physical exam to evaluate your cat’s hydration status and check for intestinal pain. A quick test for Giardia is available through your veterinarian’s office. They will likely need to do a fecal test for other intestinal parasites.

Treatment for Giardia in Cats
Medications for the eradication of Giardia are readily available and affordable. Metronidazole, an antibiotic, is most often prescribed. Additional medications may be prescribed depending upon the severity of the infection and the cat’s condition.

The disease can take multiple rounds of treatment, as cats may continually reinfect themselves through frequent grooming (ingesting cysts on their fur) and other sources of environmental contamination.

Recovery and Management of Giardia in Cats
Because cats that have been treated have no “immunity” against future infection, they can easily be reinfected. Therefore, all living areas that the cats have access to should be disinfected. Ammonia, dilute bleach solution, or steam cleaning can be effective. It is the impracticality of disinfecting entire households that makes this parasite a tough one to eliminate.

If there are other pets in your household, medications may be administered to them as a preventive measure. Contaminated soil or areas can remain infective for months under the right conditions, so avoiding those areas when at all possible is advisable. 



Multiple negative tests are necessary to ensure the disease has passed, as cysts are not always shed and detected on the test. And when bringing a new pet home, it is always encouraged to have an exam and stool check for parasites as well as Giardia testing before bringing the pet home and around other animals.
Giardia in Cats FAQsDoes Giardia in cats go away?No, Giardia is a protozoal infectious agent that will not resolve on its own. Oral medications are the recommended treatment, and Giardia does not “run its course,” as a common cold does.
Is Giardia hard to get rid of in cats? With the appropriate medication and dosage, most cases of Giardia in cats are not hard to clear, though they do require consistent treatment, strict compliance in decontaminating the home environment, and retesting to ensure the parasite is eradicated.
How long does Giardia last?Giardia will last until it is treated and eradicated. The environment must also be decontaminated or the pet can become reinfected.
Is Giardia contagious in cats?Yes, Giardia is passed in the stool of infected cats. The life cycle is fecal-oral, which means another cat would have to ingest the cysts from the environment. Keep in mind that cats are fastidious groomers, so you can imagine how the disease is spread easily.
Can my cat give me Giardia?Yes. Giardia can cause diarrhea and disease in humans. If your cat is diagnosed with Giardiasis, environmental disinfection is important for your own health and safety, as well as preventing recurrence in your cat and any other pets.
Is Giardia painful for cats?Yes. Cramping and diarrhea are as painful for cats as they are for humans.
Is Giardia fatal in cats?If untreated, Giardia can be fatal, especially in kittens. Its dehydrating effects can be quite severe.
What happens if Giardia goes untreated in cats?Cats can have painful cramping and diarrhea as well as dehydration and other symptoms if Giardia is not treated. In kittens or smaller cats, Giardia can cause death from dehydration.

424,Giant Cell Tumors in Cats,"Malignant 	Fibrous Histiocytoma in Cats

Histiocytes are white blood cells that reside within the connective tissue of the body.  Referred to as tissue macrophages, histiocytes play a defensive role in the body’s immune response, engulfing cellular debris and infectious agents, as well as initiating defense mechanisms in the system. The term histiocytoma refers to a tumor containing an excessive number of histiocytes.

Generally, histiocytomas are benign growths, but there are documented cases of malignant fibrous histiocytomas, where the tumor is composed of both histiocytes and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the most common cells found in the body’s connective tissue, playing a major role in wound healing. This condition involves the cells of both, with the addition of giant multinucleated cells, which occur as the result of the immune system cells attacking infectious agent cells and fusing together.

This category of giant cell histiocytoma is found mainly in cats, although it can occur in any animal breed.

Symptoms and Types

The most common symptoms include:


    A firm and invasive tumor in the 	fat layer of the skin
    Lack of appetite
    Weight loss, often rapid
    Lethargy


Causes

The causes for malignant fibrous histiocytoma are currently being studied.

Diagnosis

Upon examination, your veterinarian will need to rule out a variety of other medical issues prior to issuing a diagnosis and treatment plan. Other medical conditions that can cause giant cell tumors to form include:


    Fibrosarcoma - a malignant tumor 	located in the fibrous tissues
    Chondrosarcoma - a tumor that can 	be found in the cartilage of the body
    Liposarcoma - a tumor that 	develops in the fat cells of the body
    Peripheral nerve sheath tumors


  

Your veterinarian will take a sample of the suspect tissue for biopsy so that the exact composition of the tumor can be ascertained. A histological examination, along with x-ray imaging, will define the course of treatment.

Treatment

Chemotherapy can be helpful if the tumor is large, or if the cancerous cells have moved into other areas of the body (metastasized). In most cases, the highest chance for success will be in prompt and aggressive surgical removal of the tumor. Unfortunately, depending on the location, amputation may be necessary in cases where a limb is being adversely affected.

Living and Management

If chemotherapy is administered, there may be a variety of side effects. Consulting with your veterinarian regularly will enable you to better observe your cat for progress and make your cat as comfortable as possible."," and Types

425,Generalized Inflammatory Muscle Diseases in Cats,"Polymositis and Dermatomyositis in Cats
 
Polymositis and dermatomyositis are both generalized disorders which involve the inflammation of the cat's muscles. More specifically, polymyositis involves skeletal muscle damage due to inflammation, but with no pus formation, whereas dermatomyositis is a form of polymyositis in which characteristic skin lesions are also seen.
 
These disorders are rarely seen in cats and are more common in dogs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Stiff-stilted gait
    Muscle swelling
    Muscle weakness
    Muscle pain (especially when muscles are touched)
    Exercise intolerance
    Enlarged esophagus (megaesophagus)
    Regurgitation
    Skin lesions (in dermatomyositis)

 
Causes
 

    Immune-mediated infections
    Drugs
    Cancer

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and tests to evaluate levels of creatine kinase enzyme -- normally found in the brain, muscles, and other tissues -- to assess muscular damage.
 
He or she will also collect a sample of the muscle to send to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. This is the single most important test for diagnosing polymyositis.
 
In cats with regurgitation, thoracic X-rays will help evaluate the esophagus for dilatation or identify tumor(s) within the esophagus. Surgery may be required if tumor(s) are found.

 


Treatment
 
Corticosteroids are typically used to suppress overactive active immune system, which may be an underlying factor. In addition, antibiotics are prescribed to fight off infection. Long-term corticosteroids treatment may be required in cats with severe immune-mediate diseases.
 
Living and Management
 
As muscle inflammation decreases, you will need to increase your pet's activity level to improve muscle strength. Cats with an enlarged esophagus (megaesophagus) will require special feeding techniques. You will briefed about elevating feeding and adding various foods to the cat's diet, especially foods of different consistencies. In cases of severe regurgitation, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube into the cat's stomach to ensure proper nutrition. He or she will also show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist in setting up a feeding schedule. In addition, good supportive care is required to prevent skin wounds and ulcers in non-emergency patients.
 
Fortunately, cats with polymositis and dermatomyositis due to immune-mediated causes have a good prognosis. If cancer is the underlying cause of the diseases, however, prognosis is poor."," and Types

426,Gastritis in Cats,"What is Gastritis in Cats?
Gastritis is defined as inflammation of the stomach lining. Gastritis in cats can be either acute (short and immediate or less than one week in duration) or chronic (lasting longer than one to two weeks).

Acute gastritis is typically a presumptive diagnosis, and the underlying cause often goes undiagnosed because symptoms resolve with either minimal treatment, or no treatment. Chronic gastritis signs can vary in frequency and type and are characterized by inflammatory cells determined through a biopsy by a veterinarian. 

Gastritis can develop in any breed, age, or sex of cat. Younger cats are more likely to ingest inappropriate items or different foods, so they are more prone to developing acute gastritis.

Acute gastritis often is self-limiting or responds to mild therapy. Chronic gastritis can be very serious or even fatal in some cases. 

Symptoms of Gastritis in Cats
Symptoms of gastritis in cats may include:


	
	Vomiting (with or without blood)
	
	
	Decreased/absent appetite
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Melena (dark tarry stool)
	
	
	Diarrhea and/or weight loss
	


Causes of Gastritis in Cats
Gastritis can be a primary or secondary condition. This means it can occur on its own or be secondary to other systemic diseases, such as liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic disease.

The most common cause of acute gastritis in cats is dietary indiscretion (ingesting food or other items that are novel and cause inflammation of the stomach lining). Acute gastritis can also be caused by:


	
	Medication reactions
	
	
	Toxin ingestion, including plants, spoiled or toxic foods, antifreeze, and cleaning agents
	
	
	Infections (bacterial, viral, or parasitic)
	
	
	Overeating
	
	
	Stress
	
	
	Ingestion of foreign objects
	


Chronic gastritis can be caused by:


	
	Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
	
	
	Chronic foreign objects in the stomach causing partial blockage of outflow
	
	
	Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (benign or cancerous)
	
	
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
	
	
	Stomach ulcers
	
	
	Other systemic illnesses (such as liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic disease)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Gastritis in Cats
A thorough history—including any known dietary indiscretion, toxin ingestion, other illnesses, or stressful situations—and physical examination should be performed by your veterinarian when gastritis is suspected. Diagnostic testing becomes more aggressive as clinical signs become more prominent and based on the findings of other less-invasive tests.

Diagnostic tests your veterinarian may perform include:


	
	Bloodwork: A complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry profile with electrolytes helps to assess hydration status and any underlying systemic disease.
	
	
	Urinalysis: Testing of your cat’s urine helps to assess kidney function and bladder health.
	
	
	Fecal testing: Your cat’s feces will be analyzed to diagnose any intestinal parasites that may be causing gastritis.
	
	
	Abdominal radiographs: Radiographs help to find any masses, fluid in the abdomen, foreign objects, and/or blockage of the gastrointestinal tract.
	
	
	Contrast radiographs: These are used when an abdominal ultrasound is not an option. A contrast agent is introduced into the gastrointestinal tract and monitored via a series of X-rays to see how it is emptied from the body. This test can illuminate masses, blockages, and/or motility issues in the gastrointestinal tract.
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound: Ultrasound can help assess all the organs of the abdomen for any possible disease. This modality is more specific when trying to assess intestinal wall layering and thickness—and for possible obstructions.
	
	
	Biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract: A biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose the cause of underlying inflammation. Your vet may recommend an upper gastrointestinal endoscopic partial thickness biopsy or a full thickness surgical biopsy. Surgery or endoscopy can often be used to help remove foreign objects from the gastrointestinal tract—if these are the cause of gastritis.
	


Treatment of Gastritis in Cats
Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause and the severity of clinical signs. Many cases of acute gastritis are self-limiting, meaning they can be resolved without therapy.

Nonmedical therapy for gastritis includes withholding any food for 8 to 12 hours after the last vomiting episode to allow the stomach to settle. Typically, small amounts of water are offered over the first 12 to 24 hours, followed by about 8 to 12 hours of no food and small amounts of a bland diet (which is easy to digest and low in fat) several times throughout the day.

It is recommended to gradually increase the amount of food over one to two days, then slowly transition back to the original diet over a period of three to five days to avoid further belly upset.

If vomiting restarts, or if your cat continues to vomit during nonmedical therapy, you’ll need to schedule a veterinary visit. If your cat cannot keep water down and continues to vomit only when drinking, contact your veterinarian immediately.

Medical therapy for gastritis in cats includes:


	
	Anti-vomiting medications, such as Cerenia, Ondansetron, or Dolesetron
	
	
	Pro-motility agents (unless a foreign-object blockage is suspected), such as Metoclopramide
	
	
	Acid-reducers, such as Pantoprazole, Famotidine, or Ranitidine
	
	
	Fluid therapy (either subcutaneous for mild dehydration or intravenous for moderate-to- severe dehydration)
	


Cases of chronic gastritis caused by chronic inflammation (IBD or cancers) may benefit from chronic steroid usage, chemotherapeutic agents, and/or immunosuppressive medications.

Your veterinarian will help formulate a plan with you based on your cat’s diagnosis and your long-term goals.

Recovery and Management of Gastritis in Cats
Most cats with acute gastritis will improve on their own with no medical intervention. Other cases of more severe acute gastritis will require medical therapy, with a good prognosis dependent on the underlying cause. Certain blockages or toxins can be fatal if untreated. For example, antifreeze ingestion is deadly if not diagnosed and treated within a few hours of ingestion. 

The prognosis for chronic gastritis also depends on the underlying cause. Often, changes to a novel protein diet (a new protein never before introduced to the pet) or hydrolyzed protein diet and probiotic therapy is recommended for the duration of the cat’s life.

Stress should be kept to a minimum in the household. Sources of stress as well as holistic or medical therapies can be determined by your veterinarian. Frequent vet visits (every one to three months) are recommended for cats on immunosuppressive medications, including steroids and chemotherapy. Blood testing and a routine schedule of abdominal imaging may be required.

Acute gastritis can recur if your cat continues to ingest anything inappropriate, so it is important to eliminate those items—such as strings, toxins, and plants—and avoid abrupt diet changes. Unfortunately, even in the face of treatment, flare-ups are common in cats with chronic gastritis. 
Gastritis in Cats FAQsCan a cat recover from gastritis?Yes, and they often do.
Is gastritis in cats serious?It can be serious if symptoms persist or worsen, or if signs are intermittent or recurrent.
Is gastritis in cats fatal?Gastritis in cats can be fatal if secondary to a toxin ingestion; an obstruction/blockage in the stomach or intestines; or cancer.
Can stress cause gastritis in cats?Yes, stress can cause inflammation of the cat’s stomach lining, but usually urinary tract signs are more common with stress in cats than are gastrointestinal signs.

427,Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats,"What Is Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats? 
The gallbladder and bile duct are two small organs that can cause major problems for cats. If your cat’s gallbladder or bile duct is affected by inflammation, infection, or blockage, they can become seriously ill.

The gallbladder is a small organ connected to the liver that stores bile—a yellow-green fluid that is necessary for food digestion in the stomach and intestines. Bile ducts are tiny canals that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine.

Conditions that affect the gallbladder and bile duct are more common in cats than in dogs and have no association with a cat’s gender or breed. If left untreated, gallbladder and bile duct diseases can be life-threatening for your feline friend.

Types of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats

Common gallbladder and bile duct disorders include:


	
	Cholecystitis—Gallbladder inflammation
	
	
	Choledochitis—Common bile duct inflammation
	
	
	Cholangiohepatitis—Acute or chronic inflammation that affects the bile duct, gallbladder, and surrounding liver tissue

	
		
		Acute—Acute cholangiohepatitis causes sudden, obvious illness in cats and is typically seen in young and middle-aged adult felines. Affected cats have an increased risk for gastrointestinal (GI) infections.
		
		
		Chronic—Many cats with chronic cholangiohepatitis have mild or intermittent signs of illness for months or years before they are diagnosed. The condition usually affects middle-aged and senior cats.
		
	
	
	
	Cholestasis—Bile duct obstruction that can be caused by tissue swelling, inflammation, or scar tissue compressing the bile duct. Gallstones are rare in cats, but if present, they can also block the bile duct.
	


Symptoms of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
Acute cholangiohepatitis signs are usually severe and sudden, and include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Jaundice (i.e., yellow tinge to mucous membranes and white part of the eyes)
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	


Chronic cholangiohepatitis signs are typically vague and intermittent, and include:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Appetite fluctuations
	
	
	Jaundice
	
	
	Weight loss
	


Cholestasis signs can vary depending on the underlying cause, and may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite or excessive hunger
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Jaundice
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Dark urine
	
	
	Pale-colored feces
	
	
	Abnormal bleeding
	


Causes of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
Cholecystitis, choledochitis, and cholangiohepatitis can be caused by numerous issues. These disorders may develop because of any of the following problems:


	
	Impaired bile flow caused by gallbladder muscle malfunction
	
	
	Inadequate blood flow to the gallbladder
	
	
	Irritants in the bile
	
	
	Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
	
	
	Trauma to the abdomen
	
	
	Bacterial infection
	
	
	Gas in the gallbladder wall, especially in cats who have diabetes
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Abnormal gallbladder development
	
	
	An immune-mediated disorder
	


Cholestasis affects the bile duct, and its causes can include any of the following:


	
	Pancreatitis
	
	
	Intestinal inflammation
	
	
	Cholecystitis, choledochitis, or cholangiohepatitis
	
	
	Intestinal obstruction
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Gallstones
	
	
	Tumors
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
Diagnosing gallbladder and bile duct disease in cats can be difficult. To do so, your vet may need to perform extensive diagnostics such as:


	
	History—Your veterinarian will ask for a detailed medical history, including the signs your cat has shown, the length of time they have experienced problems, pre-existing medical conditions, prior surgeries, and potential trauma.
	
	
	Physical exam—Your veterinarian will be able to detect abnormalities, such as jaundice and abdominal pain, during a thorough physical exam.
	
	
	Complete blood count (CBC)—A CBC is a blood test that can detect abnormalities, such as anemia or an elevated white blood cell count, which may be present with gallbladder and bile duct disease.
	
	
	Biochemistry profile—Cats affected by gallbladder and bile duct disease typically have elevated liver values, which can be assessed through a biochemistry profile.
	
	
	Thyroid levels—Hyperthyroidism, or high thyroid hormone levels, can lead to elevated liver enzymes. Your veterinarian may test your cat’s thyroid levels to rule out this condition.
	
	
	Pancreatic function tests—Pancreatitis can cause or exacerbate gallbladder and bile duct disease, so evaluating your cat’s pancreatic function may be recommended.
	
	
	X-rays—Abdominal X-rays may reveal abnormalities but are often normal in affected cats.
	
	
	Ultrasound—Ultrasound is a good way to image your cat’s liver, gallbladder, and pancreas and to detect signs of inflammation through changes in organ appearance and blood flow.
	
	
	Fine-needle aspirate—Your veterinarian may take a bile sample from your cat using an ultrasound to guide the needle during the collection process.
	
	
	Exploratory surgery—In some cases, exploratory surgery is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.
	


Treatment of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
Treatment depends on your cat’s signs, disease severity, and the underlying cause. Initial treatment involves supportive care such as intravenous fluids and feeding tube placement. Cats who stop eating often develop hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver syndrome, a life-threatening condition. Providing nutritional support as soon as possible is important.

Other treatments may include antibiotics, corticosteroids, and medication to improve bile flow. Surgery may be necessary if a bile duct obstruction is present.

If your cat’s signs are mild, outpatient care may be appropriate, but cats experiencing significant issues will be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring.

Recovery and Management of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
When diagnosed and treated in the early stages, cats with acute cholangiohepatitis have a good prognosis for recovery. While those affected by chronic cholangiohepatitis can’t be cured, they can experience long-term remission.

The prognosis is not as good for cats in advanced disease stages. Some cats may require long-term treatment, including medications to protect their liver, vitamin supplementation, and a prescription diet.

However, if cancer is present, the prognosis for recovery is poor.

Prevention of Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats 
Preventing gallbladder and bile duct disease in cats is not possible. However, keeping your cat at a healthy weight and feeding them a nutritionally balanced diet for their life stage may reduce their risk.

428,Fur Mites in Cats,"Fur Mites in Cats
Fur mites (Lynx acarus radovskyi) are parasites that live on cats’ hair shafts. They mainly cause a dull, dry hair coat. Most cats with fur mites are not itchy.



Infestations are rare and tend to occur in more tropical regions, such as Hawaii and the Florida Keys. 

 

Causes of Cat Fur Mites
Cat fur mites are not highly contagious. Infection occurs by direct contact with other infected cats or via recently contaminated environments or grooming tools.

Symptoms of Fur Mites in Cats
Fur mites most commonly affect a cat’s hind end. The mites and their eggs may affect your cat’s coat in these ways:


	
	Salt-and-pepper appearance 
	
	
	Dull coat
	
	
	Dry coat
	
	
	Rust-colored coat
	
	
	Hair that falls out easily
	


The intensity of itching can vary greatly, depending on the severity of your cat’s allergic response. Other, extremely rare, symptoms of fur mites include: 


	
	Gastrointestinal disturbances
	
	
	Rectal irritation
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Restlessness
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Weight loss
	


Diagnosing Fur Mites in Cats
A diagnosis of fur mites in cats is made by plucking hairs and examining them under a microscope, as the fur mites live attached to the hair shaft Your vet may collect hair samples with adhesive tape for microscopic examination. 

Treatment for Fur Mites in Cats
Most routine flea and tick medications should be effective against fur mites. All pets that have come into contact with an affected cat should be treated. Fur mites are not known to affect humans.



The environment may be treated with products approved for flea control. However, that step may not be necessary if your cat will be treated over 6-8 weeks.  

 

Recovery and Management of Fur Mites in Cats
Routine treatment with flea and tick preventatives should prevent reinfestation.

429,Fungal Toxicosis Related to Fusarium Fungus in Cats,"Mycotoxicosis-Deoxynivalenol in Cats

Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin for its effect on the digestive system, is a mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium graminearum in grains such as corn, wheat, oats, and barley. Mycotoxicosis is the medical term used to describe a diseased state that is brought on by a mycotoxin, a toxic chemical that is produced by a fungal organism, such as molds and yeasts. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol refers to the toxic reaction that results when a cat ingests pet food that was made with DON-contaminated grain.

Symptoms and Types

Known symptoms of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol include a sudden refusal of food and/or vomiting after the ingestion of food contaminated by DON. The refusal of food with concurrent vomiting may also lead to subsequent weight loss. Note that if the contaminated food is removed and no longer given, these abnormal signs may resolve and no treatment will be necessary.

Studies have shown that vomiting in cats is common if DON concentration in food is greater than eight milligrams per kilogram of food.

Causes

Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol is caused by the ingestion of grains (for example, barley, wheat, corn or oats and other grains commonly used in the production of pet feeds) that are contaminated by the fungus known as Fusarium. This fungus may react in the body in a toxic manner, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, refusal of food, and weight loss.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms.  Diagnosis of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be achieved by analyzing the suspected cat food for the presence of DON. Other diagnostic procedures that may rule out diseases with similar symptoms to those of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol (namely inappetite and vomiting) include X-rays, chemical blood profile, and urine analysis.

Alternate diagnoses may include an infection due to virus, bacteria, or parasite, exposure to various toxins (such as ethanol poisoning), ingestion of poisonous plants (lilies for cats for example), tumors or other abnormal cell growths, or an infection of the pancreas.



Treatment

This condition can generally be solved simply by removing the contaminated cat food, which should result in a quick end of vomiting and a return to normal appetite and food intake. If this is done, no need for further treatment or medications should be necessary.

Living and Management

If mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol has been diagnosed, and the problem addressed via removal of the contaminated food, it will still be important for your veterinarian to check your cat's symptoms. Severe vomiting can lead to dehydration for example, in which case body fluids will need to be replenished before any of the internal organs are damaged. If weight has been lost due to vomiting or lack of appetite, your veterinarian will want you to watch your cat carefully, as cats are at particular risk of severe complications when they have gone without food for more than a day. Your cat's weight will also need to be monitored to ensure that expected normal weight gain occurs during the recovery period.

Prevention

This is a preventable disease. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be avoided by feeding only high-quality cat foods that are free of DON."," and Types

430,Fungal Infection (Pneumocystosis) of the Lung in Cats,"Pneumocystosis in Cats
 
Pneumocystosis is a respiratory infection involving Pneumocystis carinii, a fungus commonly found in the environment. Although pneumocystosis  may lead to a variety of health issues, it only affects dogs (or humans) with compromised immune systems because the weakened body defenses allows the P. carinii organism to multiply and grow to critical levels in the lungs.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Generally, the breathing difficulties will progressively worsen over a four-week period. Other signs associated with pneumocystosis include:
 

    Coughing
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Gradual weight loss
    Difficulty in routine exercises
    Physical wasting with loss of weight and muscle mass (cachexia)

 
Causes
 
Pneumocystosis is caused by an overabundance of the P. carinii fungus in the respiratory system, typically found in immune-compromised cats.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are usually non-specific and may show increased number of leukocytes or white blood cells as seen in infections, increased number of eiosinophils, and increased number of red blood cells. Blood gases testing, meanwhile, may reveal decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood (hypoxemia), and increased pressure in blood pH. Thoracic X-rays are also conducted to see the severity and stage of the infection, as related to the lungs.

For definitive diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will take a respiratory fluid sample or tissue sample to a pathologist to test for abnormal levels of P.carinii. Although it is the most reliable method for verifying pneumocystosis, lung biopsies are not without complications. Moreover, few diagnostic kits are available.


 


Treatment
 
Hospitalization and intensive care is required in severe cases. This may include oxygen therapy to minimize respiratory discomfort and prevent further decrease in the blood's oxygen level, and antibiotics to control infection. In these cases, cats are kept in isolation to minimize exposure to other pathogens. Physical therapy may also be used to promote the removal of secretion from the lungs, while intravenous fluids are used to correct dehydration.
 
Living and Management
 
Prognosis will ultimately depend on the disease that has caused the immunodeficiency. However, it is generally promising in less severely affected patients that have undergone treatment early.
 
Regular monitoring of blood gases, pulse, and thoracic radiography is required to monitor the cat's response to the treatment. In addition, you should restrict the cat's activity level to a minimum and allow it to rest in a cage. If you should notice any signs of a deteriorating condition, such as coughing, respiratory discomfort, etc., call your veterinarian immediately."," and Types

431,Fungal Infection of Lower Urinary Tract in Cats,"Fungal Infection of Bladder and/or Urethra in Cats

Fungi are usually found on the skin of cats and are also prevalent in the outer environment. These organisms are harmless most of the time, or the body is adept at fighting off any ill effects the fungus might have. Fungal infections are uncommon in cats. In some cases, however, some types of fungus may inhabit and infect the lower urinary tract, causing symptoms of infection. The fungus may also appear in the urine after being released from the kidneys. Infection is not apparent in all cases, and may be present for some time before becoming symptomatic.

Cats of any age, breed, or gender  may be affected.

Symptoms and Types

Even when a fungal infection has become well established in the lower  urinary tract, there are many cats that display no clinical symptoms. However, in others the following symptoms may be seen:


    Difficulty in passing urine
    Increased frequency of small amounts of urine
    Blood in urine (hematuria)


Causes

Following are the risk factors which may predispose your cat to a lower urinary tract fungal infection. Frequent access to the outdoors, in combination with any of these factors can increase the risk.


    Diabetes mellitus
    Surgery
    Placement of urinary catheters
    Concurrent lower urinary tract bacterial infections
    Excessive use of antibiotics


Diagnosis

You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, including a description of the symptoms and the time of onset. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count and biochemistry profile are often normal.  However, if a fungal infection has spread to other body organs, the abnormalities in these tests will depend on which of the organs is being affected.

Urinalysis is important in the diagnosis of this disease as the fungus is often passed into the urine and the laboratory testing may confirm the presence of the fungus in urine. Your veterinarian will also recommend a urine culture test, which will allow for the growing and identification of the causative fungus. Various species of fungi can be identified on the basis of their different growth patterns and characteristics on culture. More specific tests are also available for the identification of the most common species of fungi that cause infections in animals. Your veterinarian will recommend these tests if the fungus that is involved in the infection could not be identified by the culture testing.



Treatment

Fungal infections are uncommon in cats, usually occurring in the presence of other certain risk factors that are known to predispose a cat to fungal infections. Identifying and correcting these risk factors is important for the overall treatment of these infections. Antifungal drugs will be prescribed to eliminate the infection, with the duration of the treatment varying according to the individual animal. A urinary catheter may be used to infuse drugs directly in to the lower urinary tract, with repeat infusions given if required until the cat has completely recovered.

Living and Management

In some cats long-term treatment may be required for the complete resolution of clinical symptoms. During treatment, urine samples will again be collected and sent to the laboratory for culture testing. Usually two urine cultures are performed at a 10-14 day interval to see if the fungal infection has resolved or not. The fungal culture will be repeated two months after the cessation of therapy.

You’ll need to take care of your cat's diet and also adhere to your veterinarian's recommendations regarding treatment. Monitor the appearance of your cat's urine as much as possible for changes in the color of the fluid, and to note if the cat is having difficulty urinating. If anything appears out of the ordinary, consult your veterinarian so that adjustments to the treatment can be made."," and Types

Even when a fungal infection has become well established in the lower  urinary tract, there are many cats that display no clinical symptoms. However, in others the following symptoms may be seen:


    Difficulty in passing urine
    Increased frequency of small amounts of urine
    Blood in urine (hematuria)

432,Fungal Infection (Malassezia pachydermatis) of the Skin in Cats,"Malassezia Dermatitis in Cats

 

Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast commonly found on the skin and ears of cats. However, an abnormal overgrowth of the yeast can cause dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. The exact reasons behind this disease are not yet known, but it has been linked to allergy, seborrhea, and possibly congenital (born with) and hormonal factors.

 

Malassezia dermatitis is also less common in cats when compared to cats, but can affect any breed of cat.

 

Symptoms and Types

 


	Irritation of skin
	Loss of hair (alopecia)
	Greasiness
	Scaly skin
	Redness of affected areas
	Malodorous discharge from lesions
	Patches of skin becoming darker (hyperpigmentation) and epidermal thickening (seen in chronic cases)


 

Causes

 

Cats have both a juvenile and adult form of malassezia dermatitis, both of which can be associated with food and/or flea allergies. In rex cats, genetic features such as predisposition to mast cell abnormality and coat and skin types may be a factor in the onset of the disease. Mature cats with the disease, on the other hand, are often associated with thymomas and carcinomas of the pancreas and liver. Other factors that may be a predisposing factor to malessezia dermatitis include concurrent infections and high humidity and temperature.

 

Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal unless the cat has a concurrent disease.

 

More specific testing includes a culture of the causative organism as well as taking a small skin tissue sample for a skin cytology test. In this test your veterinarian will touch a sterilized cotton swab to the affected area and stain it with Diff-Quik stain on a glass slide. After staining the glass slide is observed under a microscope to demonstrate the yeast in the sample. This will help him or her identify the causative organism.



  



Treatment

 

There are various therapeutic agents used in treating this condition, but the ultimate goal is to reduce the number of yeast and bacteria. Your veterinarian will suggest medications for application on the skin and will also recommend medicated shampoos, which should help remove scales and resolve foul odors. Concurrent bacterial infections will be treated with antibiotics and antibacterial shampoos. 

 

Living and Management

 

You will need to regularly visit your cat’s veterinarian for evaluation of disease and treatment progress. At each visit, your veterinarian will examine your cat and perform a skin cytology test to confirm that the number of causative organism is decreasing. Skin irritation and bad smell usually resolve within one week of treatment; however, recurrence of disease is common when underlying conditions are not resolved.

 

Follow guidelines strictly and apply the topical medications as prescribed. Do not use any shampoo or medication or alter treatment on your cat without consulting your veterinarian. As recurrence is common, watch your cat for any untoward symptoms and call your veterinarian if you suspect a recurrence."," and Types

433,Fungal Infection (Histoplasmosis) in Cats,"Histoplasmosis in Cats



Histoplasmosis refers to a fungal infection caused by the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. It usually enters an animal's intestinal tract after being ingested through contaminated soil or bird droppings.



Symptoms



The most common symptoms for cats are lack of appetite, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Other potential signs may include:




	Coughing
	Increased breathing effort and harsh lung sounds
	Lameness
	Eye discharge
	Diarrhea
	Fever, up to to 40 degrees Celsius (104.0 degrees Fahrenheit)
	Pale gums and moist body tissues (mucous membrane)
	Enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenitis)




Causes



The primary cause of this infection is the ingestion of the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. The fungus may be breathed in when contaminated soil is disturbed, such as when a cat scratches at dirt that it has used for its own waste, or when your cat comes into contact with contaminated bird (including poultry) or bat droppings.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will want to differentiate the symptoms from heart failure, feline asthma, lymphoma, pyothorax, and fungal pneumonia. A chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis will be conducted. Blood tests may confirm the presence of histoplasma antibodies, although this only means that your cat has been exposed, not that it is in a diseased state. Further differential testing will either confirm or rule out the actual state of histoplasmosis.





Treatment



Veterinarians will usually treat this condition with medications on an outpatient basis. If inpatient treatment is recommended, it may be because your cat has been unable to eat and is suffering from malabsorption. If this is the case, your veterinarian will administer drugs, fluids, and nutrients intravenously until your cat's condition has improved.



Living and Management



After treatment, your cat's activity level should be reduced until it is fully recovered. Cage rest, or restriction to an enclosed environment will allow your cat to fully recuperate. If the condition does recur, a second course of treatment may be needed.



Prevention



To prevent the development of histoplasmosis, you will need to try to prevent your cat from being exposed to possible sources of contamination, such as where birds, poultry, or bats might roost, or around soil that is known to have bird droppings in it.

434,Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis) in Cats,"Aspergillosis in Cats



Aspergillosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by the Aspergillus, a species of common mold found throughout the environment, including dust, straw, grass clippings, and hay. An opportunistic infection occurs when an organism which does not generally cause disease becomes an infectious agent once it has entered into an animals body. In the case of Aspergillosis, it becomes an infectious agent when the body's immune system is weakened from some other disease or illness.



There are two types of acquired Aspergillus infection: nasal and disseminated. Both types can affect cats, and while no particular breed is more prone than another, Persians show a slightly higher incidence.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

There are two types of Aspergillus infections. The first is the nasal form, where the infection is localized in the nasal passages and front sinuses. It is believed that this develops from direct nasal contact with the fungus. For example, if a cat is outside and around dust and grass clippings, the fungus may enter via the moist lining of the nose. The most commonly associated symptoms are nasal discharge and noisy breathing during inhaling.

 

The second type of Aspergillus infection is disseminated, meaning it is more widespread in the body, not only in the nasal area. It is not certain how this form enters the body. Disseminated aspergillosis is most commonly associated with nonspecific signs, such as lethargy, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include protruding eyeballs.

 

Causes

 

The Aspergillus fungus is commonly found in the environment in substances such as dust, hay, and grass. As an opportunistic infection, it is only likely to infect cats with an immune system that is already in a weakened state. Cats exhibiting immunodeficiency -- an inability to produce a normal immune response -- are at higher risk, and cats with illnesses such as diabetes or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may also be more susceptible to this infection.

 

Diagnosis

 

Diagnostic procedures vary depending on whether the infection is based in the nasal passages or is disseminated through the body. For suspected nasal aspergillosis, analysis of nasal swabs, fungal cultures of nasal discharge, and a rhinoscopy -- inserting a small fiber-optic scope into the nose in order to examine the inside of the nose and its mucus linings -- can be expected. The symptoms for disseminated aspergillosis are mostly nonspecific and therefore more difficult to diagnose. Tests may include a urine analysis and X-rays to examine the spine.

 

  

 



Treatment

 

There have been successful treatments through the administration of an antifungal drug directly into the nose or further in the nasal passage. If antifungal cat medication is prescribed, you will need to follow the full course of the medication s that symptoms do no recur.

 

Living and Management

 

Continued treatment depends on the type and severity of aspergillosis. Cats with the nasal version should be monitored for reduced nasal discharge, while those with disseminated disease need to be monitored with urine analysis and X-ray every one to two months. Your veterinarian will recommend a treatment plan to monitor your cat's progress.

 

Prevention

 

General good health will help to ensure a strong and healthy immune system so that this opportunistic disease is not a cause for concern. A balanced diet with opportunities for physical activity are essential components of a healthy lifestyle for your cat. Keeping your cat indoors may also be helpful, as it will limit access to grass clippings, hay, straw, and other substances where the Aspergillus fungus grows.

435,Fungal Disease (Sporotrichosis) of the Skin in Cats,"Sporotrichosis in Cats



Sporothrix schenckii is a fungus that has the potential to infect the skin, respiratory system, bones and sometimes the brain, causing a diseased state called sporotrichosis. Infection is caused by the virtually ubiquitous dimorphic (mold and yeast) fungus, S. schenckii, which typically infects via direct inoculation - that is, through abrasions of the skin or by inhalation. The origin of the fungus is environmental; it is naturally found in soil, plants and sphagnum moss, but it can be communicated zoonotically between different animal species, and between animals and humans.



Cats tend to experience a severe form of cutaneous sporotrichosis, making them an even greater risk for transmitting the infection to other animals and people. In cats, intact male cats that roam outdoors and fight are predisposed to puncture wounds, which then offer an advantageous route for S. schenckii to enter the body. The infection may also be spread by other cats, often through scratches to the skin.



Symptoms and Types



Cutaneous sporotrichosis


	Bumps, or lesions on the skin surface, swollen lymph glands
	Lesions often appear initially as wounds or abscesses mimicking wounds
	Associated with fighting, wounds may be found on the head, lumbar region, or distal limbs
	Previous trauma or puncture wound in the affected area is a variable finding
	Poor response to previous antibacterial therapy
	Combination of cutaneous and lymph form—usually an extension of the cutaneous form, which spreads via the lymphs, resulting in the formation of new nodules and draining tracts or crusts.
	Lymphadenopathy (disease of the lymphs) is common




Disseminated sporotrichosis


	Rare, occurs when the initial infection spreads into the body to a secondary location
	Systemic signs of malaise and fever
	Osteoarticular sporotrichosis occurs when the infection spreads into the bones and joints
	Sporotrichosis meningitis occurs when the infection spreads into the nervous system and brain
	Symptoms include loss of appetite (anorexia), and weight loss (cachexia)




Pulmonary sporotrichosis


	Occurs as a result of inhalation of Sporothrix schenckii spores
	Infected animal is more at risk of developing pneumonia




Causes




	Animals exposed to soil rich in decaying organic debris appear to be predisposed
	Cat scratches provide an increased opportunity for infection
	Exposure to infected animals or clinically healthy cats sharing a household with an affected cat are at risk
	Immunosuppressive disease should be considered a risk factor








Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.



It is important to note that this is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it is communicable to humans and other animals, and proper precautions will need to be taken to prevent the spread of infection. Even if you do not have a break in your skin, you are not protected against acquiring the disease.



An examination of the fluid from the lesions is often necessary to confirm an infection. A negative finding does not always rule out the disease. Laboratory cultures of the deeply affected tissue often require surgery to obtain an adequate sample. These samples will be sent for analysis, along with a special note to the laboratory listing sporotrichosis as a differential diagnosis. Secondary bacterial infections are common.





Treatment



Because of its potential for infection in humans, your cat may be hospitalized for the initial treatment. In many situations, outpatient therapy may be a consideration. Several antifungal drugs are available for treatment of this infection. Your veterinarian will choose the type that is best suited to your cat. The treatment generally takes some time; at least several weeks after the initial treatment before the patient is considered recovered. While your cat is being treated, you will need to protect yourself from infection. Gloves and face masks are suggested, but your veterinarian will instruct you on the best methods for minimizing risk of transmission.



Prevention



Although difficult to prevent because of its prevalence in the environment, it is helpful to determine the source of the Sporothrix schenckii, so that you can take steps to prevent repeat infections.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will set up a schedule of follow-up appointments at around every 2–4 weeks in order to re-evaluate your cat's condition. Clinical signs will be monitored and liver enzymes will be assessed. Side effects associated with treatment will be evaluated, and treatment will be modified according to your cat's reactions. If your cat does not respond to therapy, your veterinarian will make changes in the medication.

436,Frostbite in Cats,"What Is Frostbite in Cats?
Frostbite is the freezing of a part of the body and often appears as damage to the skin. This damage is caused by exposure to freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time.

Cats are most vulnerable to frostbite when exposed to high winds on very cold days. This exposure can result in hypothermia (low body temperature), which causes the narrowing of blood vessels in extremities so that blood can be diverted to vital core organs. Ice may also form in affected tissues, causing cell lysis (disintegration) and further damage.

The nose, ears, tail, and digits are the most affected areas in cats. Injury of these tissues may not show until damaged tissue sloughs (sheds), which may not occur until many days after exposure.

Frostbite is an emergency, so if you suspect it in your cat, contact your veterinarian or a local emergency veterinary facility as soon as possible.

Symptoms of Frostbite in Cats
Frostbite may not be evident for several days or weeks after exposure. If your cat has been outside on a windy day with freezing temperatures, it’s important to watch for the following signs of frostbite:


	
	Cold skin or extremities
	
	
	Discolored skin (white or pale, gray, blue, red, deep purple, or black)
	
	
	Skin that becomes red, swollen, or painful as it thaws
	
	
	Blisters that may be filled with blood
	
	
	Ulcers on skin
	
	
	Cold, fragile skin that breaks when touched
	
	
	Dead skin that sloughs off (the affected skin may gradually become blacker until it falls off)
	


Cold skin, discoloration of skin, and swelling and pain could be noticed shortly after exposure. It’s never a bad idea to call your vet with any concerns—they may have you monitor for signs of frostbite or bring your cat in for observation.

There are also degrees of frostbite that help define the severity of tissue damage and expected prognosis:


	
	First-degree frostbite results in erythema (redness) after the skin is rewarmed. This level of frostbite only affects the top layer of skin and doesn’t typically cause permanent injury.
	
	
	Second-degree frostbite results in blistering of the affected skin.
	
	
	Third- and fourth-degree frostbite both result in permanent damage, and the affected tissues are more susceptible to infection. Third-degree frostbite causes skin death, and fourth-degree frostbite causes gangrene (death of tissue) potentially resulting in the loss of the affected body part.
	


Cause of Frostbite in Cats
While frostbite usually happens at extremely cold temperatures, any cat living outdoors where temperatures get below 32 F (0 C) is at risk. Cats who are more at risk are kittens, senior cats, and cats with medical conditions that decrease blood flow to the extremities, including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, and hyperthyroidism.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Frostbite in Cats
Diagnosis of frostbite is made by physical exam of the cat combined with a history of exposure to cold temperatures. There could be other conditions that can cause ulcers of the skin, such as trauma, burns, autoimmune diseases, and infections, but the key with frostbite is the combination of physical exam findings and history of exposure to cold.

Treatment of Frostbite in Cats
If your cat has been exposed to a very cold day outdoors, bring her indoors to a warm, dry location as soon as possible. If she is shivering or lethargic, she may be hypothermic. It can be helpful to wrap your cat gently in towels that have been warmed in a dryer—to begin warming the cat slowly.

If some areas of skin appear frostbitten, DO NOT rub the skin or use a hair dryer to try to warm the area—both actions can result in damage to the affected skin. You can re-warm frostbitten skin with warm (not hot) water in a bowl and then pat the areas dry with a towel (again, don’t rub). Continue to keep your cat warm while on the way to your veterinarian.

After examining your cat, your veterinarian will likely prescribe pain medications and may also prescribe antibiotics if any areas appear to be at risk for infection. Do not give your cat any pain medications designed for humans—these are not safe for cats. Your cat will need to be monitored for several days to determine if the frostbitten skin recovers. If the paws are affected, cage rest may be necessary to decrease pain while the paws heal.

If a large area of skin has died or there is a risk of gangrene, the affected area may have to be amputated. Your veterinarian will check your cat closely and recommend the best treatment.

Recovery and Management of Frostbite in Cats
It may take several days to weeks for your cat to recover from frostbite. The recovery time and prognosis are dependent upon the severity of frostbite and the amount of skin affected. Pain medications will be needed while your cat is healing, and antibiotics may also be needed to treat any infections that develop.
Frostbite in Cats FAQsAt what temperature do cats get frostbite?Any cat that is outside when temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit is at risk of getting frostbite, but very cold days with high winds increase risk.
What does frostbite look like on cats?Frostbite may appear as cold, fragile skin that could be discolored (white or pale, gray, blue, red, deep purple, or black). There may also be blisters or ulcers (sores) on the skin and eventually dead or sloughing skin.
Can cats recover from frostbite?Yes, with proper care and timeliness of treatment, cats can recover from frostbite, and many affected cats have no permanent damage.

437,Front Leg Injury in Cats,"Brachial Plexus Avulsion in Cats



Cats can experience a forelimb issue after experiencing an injury due to jumping, being in a road accident, a traumatic fall, or after being caught in, or on, something. Prompt medical attention is advised, since the possibility of a spinal cord injury or other severe damage to the body will require that a proper examination and assessment be made. Injuries to the forelimb are sometimes referred to as brachial plexus avulsion.



Symptoms and Types



Cats that are experiencing this condition will often exhibit muscular weakness, absence of pain perception, loss of shoulder movement, and the inability to put weight on their paws.

 

Causes

 

The most common causes of foreleg injuries are road accidents, serious falls, or when cats get a foot caught in or on something while jumping or exploring.

 

Diagnosis

 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) scans may be used to examine your cat's body for internal lesions. Your veterinarian will look for injuries to the spinal cord, or for any associated neurological issues.









Treatment



Treatment will be based on the severity of the injury. Bandaging the foreleg and protecting it from further injury is the most common response. Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly given to decrease swelling, and pain relievers will be prescribed if your cat appears to be suffering. Amputation is sometimes required for injuries that cannot be repaired, or under circumstances where the injury is life threatening.



Living and Management



Following treatment, clinical monitoring of your cat is recommended so that improvements to the injured site can be assessed. One of the most common suggestions is to confine and injured cat so that it will not further complicate the injury. An enclosed area, or cage, can be used to encourage your cat to rest and to ensure that the injury heals fully. Protective swaddling, or binding, is also recommended for keeping the limb in place. Physical therapy may be prescribed for regaining muscle strength during rehabilitation, after the initial severity of the injury has passed. It is important to observe your cat's behavior following treatment as there is a potential for infection if your cat rubs its paws repeatedly on the ground. Also, it is important to deter your cat from mutilating itself in an attempt to stop the pain and the associated healing sensations (e.g., itching). In most cases, the injury will resolve within a few months of the initial prognosis and treatment.



Prevention



Because animals can be injured even while doing things that are apparently harmless, and even in the safest homes, there are really no preventative measures for this medical issue. Keeping your cat indoors, or on a leash while out of doors, will go a long way toward prevention of road or environmental accidents."," and Types

438,Foreign Objects Stuck In the Esophagus of Cats,"What Is Esophageal Obstruction or Esophagus Blockage in Cats?
Cats enjoy inspecting the world around them, typically with their mouth, and because of this they often ingest things they shouldn’t.

An esophageal obstruction or blockage can occur when a cat ingests a foreign object and that object becomes stuck in their throat instead of passing into the stomach.

The esophagus, part of the gastrointestinal system, starts at the back of the mouth and is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Having a foreign object or material stuck in the esophagus can lead to a potentially life-threatening situation. For example, it can cause a tear in the esophagus or lead to an intestinal blockage.

While it is more common for a dog to have an esophageal obstruction, it happens in cats too. Having a foreign object stuck in the esophagus (known as an esophageal foreign body) can cause a physical blockage, swelling, and death of the tissue making up the wall of the esophagus.

If you notice or suspect that your cat has ingested foreign material or a foreign object, it is considered a medical emergency. Contact your local veterinary hospital immediately.

Common Foreign Objects Cats May Ingest:


	
	Piece of thread or a sewing needle
	
	
	Hair bands or hair ties
	
	
	Bones
	
	
	Large food material, often without chewing

	
		
		Large dog kibble
		
		
		Table food
		
		
		Rawhides or chew treats
		
	
	
	
	Toys—both pet toys and small objects children play with, such as Legos
	
	
	Coins
	
	
	Buttons
	
	
	Yarn
	
	
	Christmas tree decorations (tinsel or small ornaments)
	


Full Esophageal Obstruction Vs. Partial Esophageal Obstruction

An esophageal obstruction occurs with the ingestion of objects that are of a size, shape, or texture that will cause them to get stuck in the esophagus.

A partial obstruction occurs when something is stuck in the esophagus but it does not completely block the tube. In this case, food and water can still pass into the stomach and routine digestion can continue. In a partial obstruction, often there are few or no immediate clinical signs, but they develop over time.

A full esophageal obstruction occurs when the entire tube is blocked and nothing else can pass. With a full obstruction, if food or water is ingested after the object, the food or water will get stuck, or it will quickly be vomited back up. After ingestion of a foreign body, objects often get stuck in the area where the esophagus narrows in the chest cavity, or where the esophagus meets the diaphragm just before the object should pass into the stomach.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Foreign Objects Stuck in the Esophagus of Cats
Your veterinarian will want a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You should describe anything you believe your cat might have eaten that could have become lodged in its esophagus.

Your veterinarian will do a physical exam and an x-ray of the esophagus and chest. Most objects or materials that your cat ingests are visible on an x-ray. If the object is not visible, it may be necessary to have your cat swallow barium, a liquid that can make it visible on the x-ray.

Another diagnostic tool used to diagnose an esophageal obstruction is an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a tiny camera at the end that is passed through the mouth and into the esophagus to locate the problem. Endoscopy requires heavy sedation or general anesthesia to relax the mouth and muscles in the esophagus and ensure that your cat does not bite or damage the camera.

Standard blood and urine tests, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, are usually required to make sure it’s safe to use sedation or anesthesia on your cat. These diagnostics can also help to determine if the esophagus has any damage from ingesting the foreign material.

Treatment of Foreign Objects Stuck in the Esophagus of Cats
Esophageal foreign bodies, once diagnosed, should be removed immediately. An endoscopy procedure can diagnose an obstruction, and can also be used to remove the object with special tools attached to the end of the scope.

Forceps, or medical tweezers, can be used at the end of the endoscopy tube to grasp the object or material and remove it through the mouth. If endoscopy is possible to remove the obstruction, it is the preferred method, since it is the least invasive and provides for the quickest recovery.

Often, endoscopy is not able to remove the object but can be used to push the obstructive material into the stomach. If surgery is needed to remove a foreign body obstruction, it is safer to remove the object from the stomach than the esophagus.

Some foreign materials, such as bones, can be pushed into the stomach, where they can be digested. In that case, surgical removal might not be necessary. Surgery would also be indicated if there is a tear or perforation in the esophagus from the foreign object.

How Much Does It Cost to Remove a Foreign Object From a Cat’s Esophagus

Veterinary medical bills are highly variable, depending on the cost of living in your area and where the procedure is being performed. A basic endoscopy to remove the obstruction with no residual effects to the esophagus, including x-rays and anesthesia, can cost $800-$1,500.  

If, after the endoscopy procedure, it is determined that your cat needs surgery to repair the esophagus or to remove the obstruction from the gastrointestinal tract, the estimated cost would increase to $1,000-$3,000.

If the esophagus is torn and your cat requires extensive surgery and medical care, the cost could be $5,000 or more.

Recovery and Management of Foreign Objects Stuck in the Esophagus of Cats
Recovery time after an esophageal foreign body removal procedure is dependent on the severity of the obstruction—partial or complete, simple or complicated, mouth/stomach or esophagus removal.

If your cat has an uncomplicated endoscopy procedure where the obstruction is removed by mouth and no effects are noted in the esophagus, then recovery time is much shorter than if abdominal or thoracic (between the neck and the abdomen) surgery is needed. Your vet will likely provide medications after the procedure to help decrease any inflammation or pain associated with the previous obstruction.

If your cat undergoes surgery or if they were not eating prior to or post-procedure, it is typically necessary for them to remain hospitalized until fully recovered. It is recommended that cats eat soft food until the esophagus has completely healed. This can be accomplished by feeding canned food or softening the dry kibble with water.

Esophageal stricture formation is the most common complication associated with an esophageal foreign body obstruction. An esophageal stricture is when scar tissue forms along the wall of the esophagus, causing a narrowing of the tube. Sometimes a recheck endoscopy is required one to two weeks after removal of the obstruction to ensure that a stricture is not developing.
Foreign Objects Stuck in the Esophagus of Cats FAQsHow do you know if something is stuck in a cat’s esophagus?Other than seeing your cat swallow or ingest something that they should not, these are the symptoms that might indicate an esophageal obstruction.

 How long can a foreign object stay in a cat?When something is ingested by your cat, it usually takes 12-24 hours to move through the entire digestive tract. Some objects, however, can take much longer—even months! When an object is too big to progress through the digestive tract, it causes an obstruction. An object that causes an obstruction will remain in your cat’s body until it is removed medically or surgically.

439,Foot/Toe Cancer in Cats,"Digital Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats



Cats can be afflicted with several types of skin tumors, even on their feet and toes. One type of tumor that can affect the toes is a squamous cell carcinoma. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale like tissue cells are called the squamous.



Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body. This particular type of carcinoma is a slow moving one, and is typically caught before it has had a chance to spread.



However, there is usually a squamous cell carcinoma somewhere else on the skin that spreads to the toes in this case, and more than one toe is usually affected. It may appear as a small nodule, a reddish colored skin plaque, or as a papule – small and blister like in appearance, but differentiated by its lack of fluid. The SCC does not retain its appearance as a solid mass. Over time it will grow, the tissue within the mass will die (necrotize), and the tumor will ulcerate. While this form of cancer can affect any breed of cat, it remains a rare type of foot cancer in cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Swollen toes or feet
	Limping or not wanting to move around
	Ulcers (sores) on several toes
	Bleeding ulcers on the toes
	Solid, raised mass of skin on the toe (i.e., nodule, papule)
	Sores or tumors on other parts of the body
	May be without other symptoms




Causes



Squamous cell carcinomas on the toe typically occur as the result of metastasis of other tumors that have spread from another location on the cat's body.



Diagnosis



You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Be sure to describe any sores that have been apparent on other parts of the body, even if you suspect they were caused by injuries resulting from outdoor activity, or from scratching at the skin. During the examination, your veterinarian will look carefully for other sores or tumors on your cat's body. The lymph nodes will be carefully felt to determine if they are enlarged, an indication that the body is reacting to an infection or invasion. A sample of lymph fluid may be taken to test for cancerous cells. Your veterinarian will order complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your cat's other organs are working normally and to determine whether the white blood cell count is higher than normal; again, an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease or infection.



X-rays images of your cat's chest will allow your veterinarian to visually inspect the lungs for signs of any abnormalities, especially tumors. X-rays of your cat's foot will also be ordered to determine how deep the tumor is in the tissue and whether the tumor on the toe has spread to the bones in the foot. A biopsy will be taken of the tumors so that your doctor can diagnose the specific type of growth it is, whether carcinoma or a benign mass of tissue. If your cat has sores or tumors in other areas, your veterinarian will also order biopsies of these for analysis.







Treatment



Treatment will depend on how many tumors or sores your cat has and whether or not they have spread to other areas of the body. If your cat has only one tumor on one toe, it will most likely be treated with surgery. To be sure that all of the carcinoma is removed, the toe with the tumor will be removed entirely (amputated). Most cats recover well from this type of surgery and are able to walk normally afterwards.



If your cat has multiple tumors on its feet, or if there are tumors in other areas as well, surgery may not be a practical option. Your veterinarian will prescribe medication to help minimize your cat's pain, and in some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a veterinary cancer specialist so that you can determine if there are other viable treatment options.



Living and Management



If your cat has had surgery to remove a toe, it may limp a little and have some pain in its foot afterwards. Pain medication will help your cat to move through the transition, and its activity may need to be limited until it has completely recovered from the surgery. Otherwise, once it has recovered, your cat should not have any difficulty compensating quickly for the lost digit. If the tumor was limited to one spot and had not metastasized to other parts of the body, a full recovery can be expected. While this type of cancer has a good chance of not recurring, as with any cancer, it is recommended that you take your cat for regular progress checks with your veterinarian.

440,Food Poisoning in Cats,"What Is Food Poisoning in Cats? 
The feline digestive tract is designed to efficiently digest and absorb nutrients from animal proteins. Cats have a highly acidic stomach, which helps them break down their food and can protect them from microorganisms that can cause disease such as bacteria or a virus. Despite this, your feline companion is still at risk for food poisoning.

Food poisoning in cats is any illness caused by pathogens in your cat’s food. The most common culprits are E. coli, listeria, and salmonella.

E. coli are bacteria that normally live in a healthy cat’s lower intestine. The strains that typically live in your cat’s gut are not harmful. However, other strains cause infection by adhering to cells and releasing toxins.

If your cat ingests a harmful E. coli strain, they can experience serious gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as stomach cramps, watery diarrhea, and vomiting. In severe cases, the infection can enter the bloodstream, leading to multi-system problems. Healthy adult cats rarely develop E. coli intestinal infections. However, kittens and immunocompromised cats have a high infection risk.

Listeriosis is a bacterial infection found worldwide. The condition is rare in cats but can cause issues such as brain inflammation, systemic infections, and pregnancy complications. Infection can occur through ingestion or inhalation, and infections transmitted through ingestion usually localize in the cat’s intestinal wall, resulting in an ongoing and prolonged shedding of the infectious agent in the feces.

Salmonellosis is a highly contagious bacterial disease that is transmitted primarily when a cat consumes contaminated food or water.

When a cat ingests a harmful salmonella strain and the pathogen survives the cat’s stomach acid, the bacteria invade the intestinal wall and produce toxins that cause an inflammatory response.

Most affected cats exhibit no signs, but GI disease and severe systemic infection can occur. Respiratory problems, eye and brain inflammation, and pregnancy complications have also been reported in cats with salmonellosis. This pathogen is the most likely cause of food poisoning in felines.

Food poisoning caused by any of these pathogens is considered a veterinary emergency in cats—it can be fatal if left untreated. In addition, these diseases are zoonotic, which means that you can get it from your cat.

Symptoms of Food Poisoning in Cats
Food poisoning signs in cats depend on the pathogen causing the infection.

Signs of food poisoning in cats caused by E. coli include:


	
	Watery diarrhea with or without blood
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Stomach cramps and abdominal pain
	
	
	Fever

	Vomiting
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Facial nerve paralysis

	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Eye inflammation
	
	
	Swollen lymph nodes
	
	
	Abortion or infertility
	


Causes of Food Poisoning in Cats 
Any cat can contract a pathogen from their food or water. However, kittens and immunocompromised cats have a high infection risk.

Cats can get food poisoning from eating the following:


	
	Raw pet food
	
	
	Birds or small mammals
	
	
	Garbage
	
	
	Unpasteurized dairy products
	
	
	Raw eggs or meat
	
	
	Spoiled or contaminated pet food
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Food Poisoning in Cats
If your cat shows signs of food poisoning, they should be examined by a veterinarian. To determine the cause of your cat’s illness signs, your vet may perform any of the following diagnostic tests:


	
	History—Your veterinarian will ask questions about your cat’s diet, such as if they eat raw pet food, are allowed to hunt wildlife, or often get into the trash.
	
	
	Physical examination—A thorough physical exam allows your veterinarian to assess your cat’s hydration status and neurologic condition and detect any abdominal abnormalities.
	
	
	Blood work—Blood work, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, helps evaluate your cat’s overall health.
	
	
	X-rays—Your veterinarian may recommend X-rays to rule out other causes, such as a foreign body obstruction, that may cause similar signs.
	
	
	Fecal culture—Culturing your cat’s feces can identify E. coli and salmonella, and in some cases, listeria.
	
	
	Blood culture—In some cases, a blood culture can determine the pathogen causing sickness.
	
	
	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis—If your cat has neurologic listeriosis, your veterinarian may need to analyze their CSF to make a definitive diagnosis.
	


Treatment of Food Poisoning in Cats
A cat with a mild case of food poisoning can be treated on an outpatient basis, but more severely affected cats are usually hospitalized. Treatments may include:


	
	Intravenous fluids—IV or subcutaneous fluids may be necessary to control dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea.
	
	
	Nutritional support—Cats can get extremely sick if they develop hepatic lipidosis, a condition that occurs if they don’t eat for several days. Your veterinarian may place a feeding tube to ensure your feline friend receives adequate nutrition.
	
	
	Antibiotics—E. coli and listeriosis are often treated with antibiotics, but these drugs are only used in life-threatening salmonellosis cases because they can cause prolonged shedding of bacteria in the cat’s feces, which increases the risk of spreading the bacteria to other individuals, including other animals or humans.
	
	
	Pain medications—Pain medications may be needed to control abdominal cramping.
	
	
	Anti-nausea medication—Your veterinarian may also prescribe anti-nausea medications and appetite stimulants.
	


Recovery and Management of Food Poisoning in Cats
Recovery from food poisoning depends on the severity of your cat’s condition. Cats with severe symptoms will have a prolonged recovery period, and those affected by sepsis—or infection that spreads to the bloodstream—have a poor prognosis for survival.

To help your cat recover, follow your veterinarian’s directions and administer all recommended medications. Your cat will also need rechecks to determine their progress and ensure the bacteria are cleared.

While your cat is recovering, keep them quarantined from other household pets, and wash your hands thoroughly after handling or cleaning up after them.

In addition, your veterinarian may recommend a prescription GI diet or probiotics to help support your cat’s GI tract while they recover.

441,Food Allergies in Cats,"What Are Food Allergies in Cats?
A food allergy is an adverse reaction that occurs when a cat’s immune system overreacts to a food substance it has previously been exposed to. For a cat to have a food allergy to a specific ingredient, it must have ingested that ingredient in the past.

Food allergies most often affect the skin, causing itching, scratching, overgrooming, secondary infections, and sores. Food allergies can also upset the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea and/or vomiting.

Food allergies are rare cats. It is estimated that just 1% of all cats have food allergies, and up to 15% of itchy cats. Of cats with both itching and gastrointestinal symptoms, up to 42% could be food-allergic. A relationship to age, gender, or breed has not been identified.

Symptoms of Food Allergies in Cats
The most common symptom with food allergies in cats is constant itching that does not change seasonally.

Symptoms may also include:


	
	Licking
	
	
	Scratching
	
	
	Overgrooming
	
	
	Biting
	


Itching can occur anywhere on the body, but the head and neck are most often involved.

Skin lesions may also be present, which may include:


	
	Small crusts (miliary dermatitis)
	
	
	Redness
	
	
	Papules
	
	
	Self-induced trauma (sores due to biting, scratching, or licking)
	
	
	Self-induced hair loss (due to biting, scratching, or licking)
	
	
	Ulcerations
	
	
	Plaques (raised circular nodules)
	


Less commonly, there may be GI symptoms, including diarrhea and/or vomiting.

Causes of Food Allergies in Cats
Food allergies can develop at any age, even if a cat has been eating the same food for a long period of time with no issues. Most known food allergies are due to an abnormal reaction to proteins in food. Below are some common foods that cause allergies, but food allergies in cats can be caused by any food substance and are not limited these items.

Food sources that most commonly cause food allergies in cats are:


	
	Beef
	
	
	Fish
	
	
	Chicken
	


Food sources that cause food allergies in cats less commonly include:


	
	Wheat
	
	
	Corn
	
	
	Dairy
	
	
	Lamb
	
	
	Egg
	
	
	Barley
	
	
	Rabbit
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Food Allergies in Cats
The gold standard for diagnosing a food allergy is to feed the cat a strict hypoallergenic diet for 8 to 12 weeks to evaluate for improvement of symptoms. This means that no additional treats, flavored medications, or even certain formulations of medications (gelatin capsules) can be administered.

The food to be considered hypoallergenic for an individual cat will vary depending on previous foods that have been eaten. Ideally, this is a home-cooked diet with a protein source that the cat has never eaten before. There are many factors that make this difficult, and such a diet is not balanced for long-term feeding.

If symptoms improve, the old diet can be reintroduced to see if symptoms return. If they do, the hypoallergenic food should again be fed to the cat. Following this, an individual ingredient can be introduced once every 2 weeks to see if symptoms worsen. If no symptoms occur, the cat is not allergic to this ingredient.

If symptoms do appear within the next 14 days, the cat is allergic to this ingredient and it should be avoided in the future. This is a trial-and-error process to determine specific ingredients a cat may or may not be allergic to.

Alternatively, a novel protein or hydrolyzed diet may be prescribed for the elimination food trial. If improvement is seen, this diet is continued indefinitely. Commercial diets such as these are formulated to be balanced for long-term feeding.

There are many types of tests on the market to diagnose food allergies. These may include collecting blood, hair, or saliva. However, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate in clinical studies.

It is important that you keep a complete diet history to provide the veterinarian monitoring your cat’s response to a hypoallergenic food trial. The choice of food used during the trial will depend on this list. If you use a novel protein diet, your vet will choose a protein source that your cat has never eaten before. Even with hydrolyzed protein diets, it is preferable to choose one that is based on an ingredient to which your cat has not been previously exposed.

Some food-allergic cats who fail to respond to one diet may improve on another diet.

Treatment of Food Allergies in Cats
The treatment for food allergies in cats is to provide a diet that does not contain any allergy-inducing ingredients. The specific food sources you may be able to feed your cat can vary greatly. Prescription diets are recommended when performing a hypoallergenic food trial because they have stricter quality control, while over-the-counter cat food can contain contaminant proteins.

Most cats are very itchy when starting a hypoallergenic food trial, so symptomatic treatment may be necessary. Low-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are often used for this purpose. Any secondary bacterial or yeast infections must also be treated with antibiotics and/or antifungals, and repeated treatments may be necessary.

Recovery and Management of Food Allergies in Cats
If your cat has a food allergy and is fed an appropriate hypoallergenic food, symptoms can take up to 10 weeks to resolve. It is important to ensure that there are no other food sources available during this time. Food allergies require strict, lifelong dietary management.

Supplements are not recommended for cats with food allergies due to the potential for a reaction to them. They are also unnecessary, because these diets are formulated to be balanced and complete. If symptoms are not controlled by diet change alone, then other causes for the symptoms should be investigated.

442,Folding of the Intestines,"Intussusception in Cats

A change in the shape of the intestine can cause the affected portion of the intestine to slip out of its normal place (prolapse) into an adjoining cavity or duct in the body. Intussusception, the medical term used to describe this condition, can also be used to describe a folded portion of the intestine (invagination), causing that section of the intestinal tract to be blocked. Either of these conditions can result in inflammation of the intestines.

While intussusception can occur in animals of all ages, it is more common in younger animals that have weaker immune systems, generally between the ages of one week to nine years of age. In affected animals, around 80 percent are younger than one year of age. Although any breed may be affected, the Siamese breed has been found to have a higher frequency. The exact mechanism behind this medical condition is unknown. This obstruction can be either partial or complete, but the occurrence of an intussusception eventually leads to a mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.

Symptoms and Types

The clinical signs associated with the intussusception will depend on the anatomic region of the intussusception. If the intussusceptions occur in the gastroesophageal regions -- where the stomach and esophagus are located (gastroesophageal intussusception, or GEI) -- the signs are typically much more severe than if they occur in other regions.

In addition, if there is a total obstruction, the cat will have severe complications potentially and symptoms that are more severe. Whether partial or complete, obstruction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to hypovolemia, dehydration, and compromise of the venous and/or lymphatic systems. Prolonged obstruction can lead to necrosis (death of the tissue) and disruption of the normal capacity of the mucosal barrier that protects the GI tract, allowing bacteria and toxins to be absorbed into the GI tract.

Other common symptoms can include:

Intussusception high in the intestinal tract

    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Vomiting
    Bloody vomit (hematemesis)
    Regurgitation (inability to swallow food)
    Abdominal pain
    Abdominal distention


Intussusception low in the intestinal tract

    Bloody diarrhea (melena)
    Occasional vomiting
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Weight loss
    Straining to defecate (tenesmus)


Causes

It can be challenging to isolate the exact cause, as any disease that can alter gastrointestinal motility can lead to an intussusception. Some of the most common causes include: enteritis, recent abdominal surgery, intestinal mural disease, intestinal parasites, a foreign object in the tract, and intense contractions of the bowel portion of the intestine.



Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately.

While some intussusceptions can be chronic in nature, a chronic history of vomiting and/or diarrhea does not necessarily confirm an intussusception. Imaging is often used to properly view the intestines for any possible other causes. This may show an object in the intestinal tract, or a mass of tissue. Your veterinarian may also choose to use a contrasting agent -- a solution that is highlighted in X-ray -- that is either injected or fed to your cat, so that it can be tracked as it  progresses through the intestinal tract, allowing your doctor to view any abnormal turns of obstructions.

A fecal sample will be taken to check for intestinal parasites, and the electrolyte balances will be checked. In the case of intussusception that are high in the gastrointestinal tract, electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia are not uncommon.

Treatment

Immediate and aggressive intravenous fluid treatment will need to be given if your cat is dehydrated, and your cat's electrolyte imbalances will need to be treated as well. Your veterinarian will initially work on stabilizing your cat and addressing any signs of electrolyte imbalances. A sodium solution may also be given if your cat is found to have hyponatremia. Following any surgical procedure, it is recommended that you limit your cat's daily activity until a complete recovery has taken place. Antibiotics are often administered to reduce the likelihood of a potential infection developing.

In the case where a foreign object is found to be causing the obstruction, or a complete block is present, surgery will need to be initiated to correct the issue. If your veterinarian believes the intestinal tissue is ulcerated as a result of the irritation, medications can be prescribed to encourage healing and prevent infection.

Living and Management

It is important to maintain fluids following the surgical procedure to prevent dehydration. Most recurrence issues occur within the first several weeks of the animal's surgery, so this is the time for more careful observation. Your doctor will advise you on an appropriate diet for the days following surgery or treatment. Generally, they will be small, easily digestible meals for the first several days, and depending on your cat's recovery, the diet can return to normal once the issue has resolved."," and Types

The clinical signs associated with the intussusception will depend on the anatomic region of the intussusception. If the intussusceptions occur in the gastroesophageal regions -- where the stomach and esophagus are located (gastroesophageal intussusception, or GEI) -- the signs are typically much more severe than if they occur in other regions.

In addition, if there is a total obstruction, the cat will have severe complications potentially and symptoms that are more severe. Whether partial or complete, obstruction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to hypovolemia, dehydration, and compromise of the venous and/or lymphatic systems. Prolonged obstruction can lead to necrosis (death of the tissue) and disruption of the normal capacity of the mucosal barrier that protects the GI tract, allowing bacteria and toxins to be absorbed into the GI tract.

Other common symptoms can include:

Intussusception high in the intestinal tract

    Difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
    Vomiting
    Bloody vomit (hematemesis)
    Regurgitation (inability to swallow food)
    Abdominal pain
    Abdominal distention


Intussusception low in the intestinal tract

    Bloody diarrhea (melena)
    Occasional vomiting
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Weight loss
    Straining to defecate (tenesmus)

443,FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease),"What Is Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease?
Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a term that refers to several conditions affecting your cat’s lower urinary tract, including the urethra (a thin tube that carries urine) and bladder. FLUTD can be frustrating for both pet owners and veterinarians because the underlying cause can be difficult to identify, and the illness can range in severity.

Most cases of FLUTD can be managed with a combination of medications, diet, and environmental changes.

FLUTD can occur in cats at any age, depending on the underlying cause. It is most often seen in young to middle-aged adult cats but has been diagnosed in kittens and even senior cats who have never shown urinary symptoms.

Types of FLUTD     

Currently, FLUTD is used as an umbrella term to describe the clinical signs of a few syndromes that can occur on their own or in combination. Some of the conditions that cause FLUTD include:

Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

This is the most common cause of urinary symptoms in cats. UTIs are caused by bacteria colonizing the urethra or bladder, and they occur most commonly in female cats. Risk factors for UTIs include obesity, poor grooming, diseases (such as diabetes and kidney disease), or anatomical changes in the bladder or urethra.

Bladder Stones (Urolithiasis)

Bladder stones may occur in cats with UTIs. Stones not caused by infection are thought to result from a combination of diet and genetics. Bladder stones can range from being very uncomfortable to life-threatening. Cats with bladder stones are at risk for urethral obstruction, or the blocking of the exit for urine, which can cause death within hours.

Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)

In FIC, cats experience inflammation of the bladder not caused by bacteria or stones. Unfortunately, FIC is just as severe as other forms of FLUTD and can still cause urethral obstruction in male cats.

Cancer (Bladder or Urethra)

Cancer of the bladder or urethra is a rare cause of FLUTD, but it is a serious condition. To rule out cancer, a full workup is important in a cat with FLUTD, even if UTI, bladder stones, or FIC is suspected.

 
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease
The most common symptom of FLUTD is your cat urinating outside the litter box (inappropriate urination). Inappropriate urination often occurs on clothes, bedding, and rugs. Some cats may choose one location, but others may urinate throughout the home.

Your cat may also make very frequent trips to the litter box but only pee small amounts at a time. Other symptoms include vocalizing while urinating and/or the presence of blood in the urine.

If you see your cat trying to use the litter box and producing no urine at all, or just a few small drops, bring them to the vet immediately. This may be a sign of the most severe FLUTD syndrome: urethral obstruction. This occurs more commonly in male cats but can occur in females as well.

Causes of Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease
While anatomical changes, obesity, diet, and genetics can increase the risk of urinary tract infections and bladder stones in cats, feline idiopathic cystitis is a more complicated diagnosis.

Leading studies suggest there is a connection between FLUTD symptoms and stress or perceiving a threat in the environment. Common things that you may not see as stressors might cause a lot of stress for your cat, such as certain scents, noises, and even furniture changes. The source of stress may be more obvious, as well—stray cats outside, new babies, losing a family member, and so on. We’re still not sure exactly how these stress events and situations cause physical changes in a cat’s bladder.

Most, if not all, cases of FIC require some form of environmental management (making a change in your cat’s environment) and stress/anxiety relief to resolve the symptoms.

How Vets Diagnose FLUTD
Diagnosis of FLUTD can be tricky and often relies on a combination of physical exam findings, test results, and—most importantly—patient history. At minimum, your vet will perform a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. Some cases may require a urine culture if the infection is hard to find or does not respond to initial antibiotics.

You vet may also take a blood sample to look for systemic infection, diabetes, and kidney disease. These conditions may have similar symptoms to FLUTD. Stones in the bladder or urethra can usually be found on x-rays, though doctors with access to ultrasound may prefer using ultrasound to look for kidney changes or bladder abnormalities that wouldn’t show up on x-rays. Advanced imaging, such as MRI or CT, is rarely used.

Successful diagnosis and treatment of FLUTD often requires a lot of information about how a cat interacts with their environment at home. Recent behavior changes in your cat are an important part of the diagnosis. You may be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire about how and where your cat eats, sleeps, plays, and interacts with family members. These questionnaires can be just as helpful as regular lab tests because they can help identify stressors in your cat’s environment.

Treatment for FLUTD
Treatment of FLUTD is very individual and based on the specific syndrome. Some common treatments include increasing water consumption (feeding wet food or tempting cats with a water fountain), giving your cat more litter box options, and weight loss in overweight cats. Some cats require a combination of therapies or a “multimodal” approach.

Here are some more specific treatments your vet may use based on the underlying cause.

Urinary Tract Infections

Bacterial infections are an uncommon cause of FLUTD (only present in 5-15% of cases), but if urinalysis or urine culture discovers bacteria in your cat’s bladder, your vet will likely prescribe antibiotics.

Bladder Stones

Bladder stones often require surgery, especially in male cats who are at risk of a dangerous urethral obstruction. Some stones can be dissolved using prescription diets, but this approach must be used with caution, as it can take weeks. Once a stone is removed from the urinary system, your cat will likely be put on a prescription diet to reduce the risk of new stones forming.

FIC

FIC is perhaps the most difficult syndrome to control. Treatment of FIC in cats often involves a combination of pain medications, a prescription diet, anti-spasmodic medications, and environmental management. Treatment often includes behavioral elements, such as:


	
	Determining and eliminating sources of stress or anxiety for your cat
	
	
	Ensuring easy access to food, water, and litter boxes
	
	
	Allowing your cat as much freedom as possible to express normal behaviors
	


You can use pheromone diffusers, food puzzles, cat trees, and water fountains to reduce stress and promote your cat’s happiness. Extreme cases may require anti-anxiety medications, but these are often a last resort.

Recovery and Management of FLUTD
Though improvement of symptoms can occur within days, it is common for FLUTD to come back, so active management will be a lifelong commitment. Medications may only be used long-term in severe cases. Cats that respond well to prescription diets should stay on them indefinitely. You will work with your veterinarian to adjust treatment accordingly.

Sudden changes in your cat’s environment make it much more likely for symptoms to return. You will need to try to anticipate stressful situations for your cat, such as moving or adding new pets or family members to the household.

While many cats with FLUTD can live a long and happy life, it is not uncommon for treatment to fail. Unfortunately, euthanasia may be considered for cats with pain and anxiety that cannot be controlled.
FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease) FAQsHow long can a cat live with FLUTD?Your cat will have a normal life span if the disease can be managed well. That said, management can be difficult, and some pet parents may need to choose humane euthanasia or try rehoming their pet.
How do I know if my cat has FLUTD?Cats with FLUTD show any or all of the following clinical signs: urinating outside the litter box, visiting the litter box frequently, straining to urinate, and blood in the urine. Male cats with severe complications may exhibit vomiting, decreased appetite, and/or hiding—sometimes, with no known urinary symptoms.
How long does it take for FLUTD to go away?The time frame depends on the specific type of FLUTD. Urinary infections may clear up in a few days, while FIC may take weeks to months to manage appropriately.
What do you feed a cat with FLUTD?There are multiple prescription diets available to help manage FLUTD in cats. These diets are created to increase thirst/water intake, change the pH of the urine, reduce the risk of bladder stones, and even help with behavioral management. For situations where a prescription diet is not practical, cats with FLUTD benefit from a diet based on canned food to help increase water intake.

444,Fluid Retention and Tissue Swelling Due to Collection of Lymph in Cats,"Lymphedema in Cats 

Although it is less common in cats than in dogs, lymphedema is a serious medical condition. It is occurs when localized fluid retention and tissue swelling circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Also known as lymph, this watery fluid typically collects into interstitial spaces, especially subcutaneous fat, as a result of a compromised lymphatic system.

Symptoms and Types

The fluid accumulation (edema) is usually not painful and pits; that is, a depression develops if the skin is pushed with a finger (which eventually disappears if fibrosis occurs). Limb swelling, meanwhile, is present at birth or develops in the first several months. The swelling may be affect one or several limbs, and typically begins at the end of the limb and slowly moves upwards. In some cases, lameness and pain may also develop.

Causes

Hereditary and congenital (present at birth) forms of lymphedema are caused by malformations of the lymphatic system, such as aplasia, valvular incompetence, and lymph node fibrosis. Other potential causes include heart disease, trauma to the lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes, and heat or radiation exposure.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal.

The most reliable test used to diagnose this condition, however, is called lymphography. This imaging examination uses a contrast substance, which is injected directly into the lymphatic system, to better visualize the affected region before taking X-rays.

 
Treatment

Although there is currently no cure available for lymphedema, a number of medical and surgical treatments have been attempted with variable outcomes. Long-term application of pressure wraps and antibiotics to prevent infections may be successful in some patients, while rest and massage seem to not help in treating the condition. There are also various surgical techniques that are used to treat lymphedema, but none have demonstrated consistent results.

Living and Management

As there is no cure available, most veterinarians focus on alleviating secondary symptoms and complications such as lameness."," and Types

445,Fluid in the Lungs in Cats,"Pulmonary Edema in Cats



Pulmonary edema refers to fluid buildup in the lungs and is often associated with pneumonia, although there are many other possible causes. Normal lungs have fluid that is moved from the lungs into the internal space of the body, an on-going process for normal healthy function. If there is added pressure in the lungs or other underlying conditions, this mechanism can become damaged and fluid can begin to build in the lungs.



If this excess fluid is not removed, edema forms. Damage can occur if this condition is left untreated, but when treated appropriately, the outcome is positive.



Animals of all ages, genders, and breeds can be diagnosed with pulmonary edema. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



Some of the most common symptoms of pulmonary edema are:




	Tachypnea
	Dry cough
	Dyspnea
	Wheezing
	Crackling noises during breathing (rales)
	Open-mouth breathing




Pulmonary edema affects both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.



Causes



Some of the most common causes for pulmonary edema are:




	Anemia
	Pneumonia
	Cardiomyopathy
	Too little protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia)
	Toxins (e.g., smoke and snake venom)
	An obstruction of the animal's airway
	A near drowning (where a high amount of fluid enters the lungs)




Diagnosis



Upon examination, the following conditions will need to be ruled out for proper treatment:




	Upper airway obstruction
	Bronchitis
	Pneumonia
	Heart worm disease
	Heart disease




Typically a blood test will be performed to look for abnormalities, as well as an X-ray to view potential signs of pneumonia.







Treatment



The type of treatment will be dependent upon the severity of the medical condition. Oxygen may be used to help the animal to breathe, while certain fluids may be administered to aid in the flow of fluids within the cat's body.



Rest is recommended to assist in the cat's recovery time. Also, diuretics have proven effective at reducing edema, as they work to force excess water and fluids out of the animal's body.

 

Living and Management



This is a condition that has a high recurrence rate, so ongoing management and observation is often recommended and required.



Prevention



Unfortunately, there are currently no known preventive measures for pulmonary edema."," and Types

446,Fluid Buildup in the Sac Surrounding the Heart in Cats,"Pericardial Effusion in Cats

Pericardial effusion is a condition in which an abnormally large amount of fluid collects in the pericardial sac that surrounds the cat's heart (pericardium). A secondary condition, referred to as cardiac tamponade, results from this retention of fluid, as the swelling of fluid applies pressure on the beating heart, compressing it and restricting its ability to pump blood.

The pressure inside the heart increases, and since the right atrium and ventricles normally have the lowest cardiac filling pressures, they are the most affected by cardiac tamponade. With the elevated pressure inside the cat's heart, the heart has a lower cardiac output, leading to right-sided congestive heart failure. Fluid retention throughout the body typically follows ascites, swelling of the limbs, and weakness or collapse.

Dogs and cats are both susceptible to pericardial effusion. If you would like to learn more about it affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types


    Lethargy
    Vomiting
    Anorexia
    Pale 	gums
    Abdominal 	distention
    Exercise 	intolerance
    Fainting 	or collapse
    Respiratory 	distress
    Increased 	breathing rate and/or increased heart beat rate


Causes


    Congenital 	disorders (birth defects, or genetic traits)
    Congestive 	heart failure (failure due to excess fluid retention)
    Coagulopathy: 	a disease that affects the body's ability to clot (coagulate) blood
    Constrictive 	pericarditis with fibrosis (inflammation of the pericardium with 	excess fibrous tissue)
    Infection 	of the pericardium
    Foreign 	object in the body causing internal distress
    Left 	atrial tear or cardiac trauma
    Cancer


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, in order to rule out underlying systemic diseases like cancer or infection. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition.

Blood tests can help to diagnose disorder that has caused fluid buildup in the pericardial sac. If infection or cancer is the cause of the pericardial effusion, a pericardial fluid analysis can be done to identify the origin of the cancer, or the type of infection. Radiograph and echocardiograph imaging are crucial for correct diagnosis of pericardial effusion. An echocardiograph is even more sensitive than a radiograph for diagnosis of pericardial effusion. An electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical conductance of the heart, sometimes shows a distinct pattern if the cat is suffering from cardiac tamponade.

  

Treatment

If the cat is diagnosed with cardiac tamponade, immediate pericardiocentesis (drawing the fluid out of the pericardial sac with a needle) is essential; however, this is rarely needed in cats.

Cats in respiratory distress will be stabilized with the use of administered oxygen and an oxygen cage. Some animals may need their pericardium surgically removed (pericardiectomy), if there is persistent effusion.

Living and Management

If symptoms of pericardial effusion should reoccur in your cat, contact your veterinarian immediately. If your pet has undergone a pericardiectomy, check the surgical incision every day to make sure it is clean, and that it is healing properly. There is always a risk of infection when the skin has been operated on.

If there is any itching, swelling, redness, or oozing at the surgical site, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement."," and Types

447,Fluid Buildup in the Kidney Due to Kidney or Ureter Obstruction in Cats,"Hydronephrosis in Cats

In most cats, hydronephrosis occurs when fluid builds up in the kidney, causing progressive distention of the renal pelvis (the funnel-like dilated proximal part of the ureter in the kidney) and diverticula (out pouching, with atrophy of the kidney secondary to obstruction).

The disease is usually one-sided and occurs secondary to complete or partial obstruction of the kidney or ureter by kidney stones, tumor, retroperitoneal (the anatomical space behind the abdominal cavity), disease, trauma, radiotherapy, and accidental binding of the ureter during spaying and after ectopic ureter surgery. Bilateral hydronephrosis (distention and dilation of the renal pelvis) is rare. When it does occur, it is usually secondary to trigonal (a triangular smooth area at the base of the bladder), prostatic, or urethral disease. This condition is relatively uncommon in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    May be without overt symptoms
    Anorexia (lack of appetite)
    Restlessness
    Polydipsia and polyuria (excessive thirst and excessive urination)
    Hematuria (blood in urine)
    Signs of uremia
    Very foul breath
    Mouth sores
    Vomiting
    Abdominal pain
    Lower back pain
    Abdominal distention


Causes

Any cause of ureteral obstruction:


    Kidney stones
    Ureteral stenosis (narrowing of the ureters)
    Atresia (closed)
    Fibrosis (formation or development of excess fibrous connective tissue)
    Tumor
    Trigonal mass
    Prostatic disease
    Vaginal mass
    Retroperitoneal (anatomical space behind the abdominal cavity) abscess, cyst, hematoma, or other mass occupying this space
    Accidental ureteral ligation during spaying
    Postoperative complication from ectopic ureter surgery
    Perineal hernia (abnormal displacement of pelvic and/or abdominal organs into the region around the anus called the perineum)
    Secondary to congenital ectopic ureters


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat after taking a thorough medical history from you. You will need to give your veterinarian as much information on your cat's health and recent activities as you can. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out or confirm other causes of disease.

Abdominal x-rays and an ultrasound are important tools for diagnosing hydronephrosis and its underlying cause. Also essential is a transurethral urethrocystoscopy or vaginoscopy, procedures that are performed using a small camera to visualize the inside of the vagina or the urethra (two tubes which drain from the kidneys to the bladder).



Treatment

Your cat will be treated on an inpatient basis and will be started on supportive care (e.g., fluids and antibiotics) while diagnostic testing is performed. Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits will be undertaken using intravenous fluid therapy over 4–6 hours, followed by maintenance fluids as needed. Some patients may be extremely polyuric (excessive urination), necessitating higher maintenance fluid rates to replace those being excreted.

Relieving the lower urinary tract obstruction as soon as possible by catheterization will be a foremost priority, along with serial cystocentesis.  Cystostomy is the surgical formation of an opening through the abdomen into the urinary bladder using a tube-like structure. Any obstructions should then be surgically corrected as soon as is possible.

Your veterinarian will discuss with you the possible presence and implications of renal disease and the possible need for surgery should it be diagnosed. Specific treatment (usually surgical) depends on the cause of the disease and whether there is concurrent renal failure or other disease process at work (e.g., metastatic cancer).  Emergency surgery is rarely required for renal disease. Kidney removal is generally not necessary unless is is infected or cancerous. If mild disease is secondary to the kidney stones, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which uses shock waves to break up the kidney stones, may be used as an alternative to surgery.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you every 2-4 weeks after the obstruction has been successfully removed in order to monitor your cat's progress. Bloodwork will be taken at these appointments to be sure that the blood urea nitrogen and blood creatinine levels have fallen to normal levels. If you notice that your cat is urinating excessively and/or losing weight after the obstruction has been removed, contact your veterinarian for a further examination."," and Types

449,Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats,"What Is Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats?
Some pet flea and tick medications—including topical sprays, dips, and shampoos—contain pyrethrin and/or pyrethroid. Pyrethrin and pyrethroid may also be found in insecticidal agricultural and home products.

Pyrethrin is an insecticide derived from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium (“mum”) flowers. Pyrethrins are safe to use in cats if administered at appropriate doses. Pyrethroid is the synthetic version of pyrethrin, designed for enhanced stability and potency. Pyrethroids are not safe to use in cats. The most common pyrethroid is called permethrin, which is found in over-the-counter spot-on products labeled for dogs and is metabolized (broken down) in the liver. 

Your cat’s liver is very inefficient at processing permethrin, which causes it to build up, leading to poisoning or toxicity.

If your cat’s symptoms are not treated, this toxicity may lead to seizures and death within a few hours. Permethrin toxicity may also occur in dogs, but it is rare and typically only at very high doses.   

Symptoms of Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats
Poisoning symptoms in cats usually occur minutes to hours after exposure to or application of the flea and tick medicine, but may be delayed up to 72 hours. The symptoms typically last two to three days.  

The most common symptoms of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats include:  


	
	Tremors/muscle twitching/trembling 
	
	
	Ear twitching  
	
	
	Loss of balance or stumbling (ataxia)  
	
	
	Lethargy  
	
	
	Drooling (hypersalivation)  
	
	
	Itchiness  
	
	
	Hiding  
	
	
	Agitation  
	
	
	Vomiting/diarrhea 
	
	
	Seizures and death if symptoms are untreated 
	


Causes of Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats
Causes of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats include:


	Accidentally or intentionally applying dog flea and tick medicine to a cat
	A cat brushing against, laying with, or licking a dog that recently had spot-on medicine applied. Such medicines can take up to 24 hours to dry.  
	Sensitivity to appropriately applied/dosed flea and tick products 
	Overdose  


You should never apply dog flea and tick products to cats. Cats are not small dogs!  

You should always use the correct weight range on the product’s packaging to determine the appropriate dose.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats
Your veterinarian will ask for a detailed history of any topical medication, shampoo, dip, or spot-on medicine applied to your cat or other pets in your household. If possible, take the product and packaging for the vet to examine. 

Your vet will start with a thorough physical examination to assess your cat’s neurological status. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation.   

Unfortunately, there is no specific toxicology test available to determine if your cat was exposed to pyrethrin or pyrethroid. Therefore, the history of exposure to these products is valuable information for your vet. 

Early detection and treatment are key to your cat’s successful recovery.   

Treatment of Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats
If your cat is experiencing poisoning symptoms, they should be treated as quickly as possible.

If you realize you accidentally applied a dog product to your cat, or your cat starts to show symptoms after recent application of a spot-on product to them or to other pets in the household, call your vet immediately for assistance.

Depending on the severity of your cat’s symptoms, to prevent further absorption of the product, your vet may instruct you to immediately bathe your cat in diluted dishwashing liquid (such as Dawn) and go to a local emergency veterinary hospital.

The emergency vet will assess your cat’s temperature and neurological status. It is likely your cat will be hospitalized for up to three days while undergoing treatment.

There is no known antidote for permethrin toxicity in cats, so treatment mainly consists of supportive care to treat the neurological signs listed above. This may involve:


	
	IV muscle relaxers
	
	
	IV fluids
	
	
	Anti-nausea medication  
	


Your vet may also recommend a newer treatment called intralipid therapy, which helps pull the permethrin out of cat tissues faster and lessens symptoms.    

Recovery and Management of Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats
Your cat’s symptoms may last for up to three days, even if you try decontaminating them in diluted dishwashing liquid. Hospitalization is recommended until your cat’s tremors or twitching resolve and they are back to normal.  

Prognosis is excellent for early and aggressive treatment. However, if your cat’s severe neurological symptoms are untreated or are treated very late, permethrin toxicity in cats can be fatal within a few hours.

Typically, cats that recover go on to live normal lives with no secondary consequences.   

Prevention of Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats 

Prevention of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats (permethrin toxicity) is key when it comes to avoiding an emergency with your cat. It’s critical to remember:


	
	Never put a dog flea and tick medication product on a cat
	
	
	Always follow the product recommendations for dosing
	
	
	Ask your vet about flea and tick prevention product recommendations for your specific pet   
	
	
	Separate your cat for 24 hours from any dogs that were treated with a topical product
	
	
	If you have a cat and a dog in one household, ask your vet for a dog flea and tick medicine that does not contain permethrin  
	
	
	Keep all flea and tick medication in a safe place away from animals   
	

Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats FAQsWhat happens if your cat licks flea medicine?Licking a permethrin-based spot-on flea and tick product for dogs is toxic to cats. If your cat has brushed up against or licked a dog within 24 hours of a spot-on flea and tick medication application, call your vet immediately. If your cat licks a cat-safe flea and tick medication, the bitter taste will typically cause drooling and possibly nausea.   
How long does your cat’s flea medicine toxicity last?Toxicity from your cat’s exposure to permethrin-based spot-on flea and tick products for dogs may last up to three days. Never put a product labeled for a dog on a cat. Cats are not small dogs!  
How do you stop your cat from licking flea medicine?Spot-on flea and tick products may take up to 24 hours to dry. It is very important to separate dogs from cats in the household for 24 hours after applying permethrin-based spot-on medicine to dogs.

If you apply a cat-safe flea and tick spot-on product to your cat, be sure to do it at the nape of the neck. This should keep the cat from reaching and licking the product.

450,Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats,"What Is Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats?
Flea allergy dermatitis is a common skin allergy in cats that can occur from a flea bite. Cats can be allergic to the flea’s saliva, which causes the release of a histamine-like compound, resulting in a very itchy skin condition. Flea allergy dermatitis commonly occurs on the head, neck, and back (also known as the “racing stripe” pattern on the skin).  

Allergies are caused by a prior exposure to an allergen. If the body’s immune system recognizes the substance as “foreign,” a reaction may occur. One flea bite can be enough to make your cat’s skin itchy for up to 2 weeks.  

Cats may also be allergic to environmental allergens (pollens, dust, mold, and dander) or have food allergies (specifically to the chicken and fish protein sources in most commercial diets). Flea allergy dermatitis differs from food and environmental allergies based on the pattern of skin lesions and the history of the pet.

Symptoms of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
If your cat has flea allergy dermatitis, their skin will appear red (erythema), be mildly to severely itchy (pruritus), and may have crusts or small bumps (papules). Most pet parents notice their cat scratching frequently and excessively grooming. You may also notice hair loss on the head, neck, or back (it can also occur on the abdomen and inner thighs). Any itching and hair loss in these locations is suggestive of flea allergy dermatitis.

Causes of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
Cats can be allergic to the saliva of the fleas, which is transferred during the flea bite. Fleas use a mouthpart called a proboscis to suck blood rather than biting. Once the saliva is transferred, a histamine-like compound, along with other inflammatory mediators in the skin, causes the noticeable symptoms of skin redness and itching. One flea bite is enough to cause a reaction in an allergic cat.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
Flea allergy dermatitis is diagnosed during a physical exam by your veterinarian, with or without your cat having a history of fleas. No other tests are needed to confirm this diagnosis.  

Live fleas may be seen, but the absence of live fleas doesn’t rule out this condition. Fleas can jump on your cat, bite, and jump off. Or your cat may bite or lick at the area of the flea bite and remove the flea.  

A flea comb may be used to look for live fleas or evidence of fleas (flea feces). Flea feces will look like flecks of pepper on the hair, coat, and skin, and they are often misinterpreted by pet parents as dirt. Skin lesions (bumps or hair loss) along with itchy skin located at the base of the tail is sufficient evidence to make a presumptive diagnosis of flea allergy.

Treatment of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
The goal of treatment is to alleviate the itching and treat for fleas on the cat as well as in the environment. For mild itching, over-the-counter topical sprays that have hydrocortisone can be used for several days to help control itching. This spray should not be used on the head or face because it could damage the cat’s eyes.  

An Elizabethan collar (also known as an e-collar or cone) can be used to help prevent scratching on the head and neck.  

Treatment of Itching 

Prescription medications such as corticosteroids are often necessary if itching is moderate or severe. These medications include an oral tablet such as prednisolone or an injectable form such as methylprednisolone acetate (also known by brand name Depo-Medrol). Injectable forms can be a good option for pet parents since most cats are not easy to medicate daily with a tablet.  

Moderate to severe scratching may lead to a skin infection. Small, raised, pinkish red bumps or pimples can occur, as well as ulceration of the skin (sores) and scabs from severe scratching. Skin infections will need to be treated with antibiotics, which your veterinarian can prescribe. These are available in oral or injectable form.

Recovery and Management of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats
Cats will recover once the fleas are controlled. Itching may take 1-2 weeks to resolve completely.  

Prevention of Flea Allergy Dermatitis in Cats 

Flea control is essential. Cats with flea allergy dermatitis are very sensitive to even a few flea bites. Indoor and outdoor cats are both susceptible to fleas since they can be anywhere in the environment. For this reason, flea control is recommended for all cats in the household all year round. Fleas survive very well in winter months in most states in the USA.  

The spot-on and oral products listed below are the most effective flea control. Shampoos and powders are much less effective and can cause further skin irritation. Consult your veterinarian before using any flea control products. Some products that are safe for dogs are toxic to cats. Do not use permethrin-containing products in cats. Your cat’s age and weight will matter when choosing flea products.  

Recommended over-the-counter flea control products (available without a prescription) include: 


	
	Topicals: Frontline, Advantage II, Effipro Plus, Cheristin (each effective for 30 days) 
	
	
	Collar: Seresto (effective for 8 months) 
	
	
	Oral: Capstar (as needed, can be given daily; treats live flea infestation, but will not prevent fleas) 
	


Prescription products that have proven more effective include: 


	
	Topicals: Revolution (effective for 30 days; also prevents heartworm and intestinal parasites), Bravecto (effective for 90 days) 
	
	
	Oral: Credelio (effective for 30 days) 
	


The environment the cat lives in should also be treated, both indoors and outdoors. If you treat the cat and not the environment the cat lives in, the flea life cycle will continue and the fleas will return. Your veterinarian can offer suggestions for products that are safe for pets indoors. Keep in mind that to control the entire flea life cycle, the product should contain an insect growth regulator (known as an IGR) to kill the flea eggs and larvae that can hatch and become adult fleas. You may need to have the indoor and outdoor areas treated professionally by pest specialists.

The skin irritation will resolve sooner if the fleas are controlled.
Are flea allergy dermatitis home remedies available?Bathing your cat in cool or lukewarm water or with mild oatmeal shampoo may help soothe the skin. If your cat’s skin is ulcerated or has scratches, it is best not to bathe them. Over-the-counter topical 1% hydrocortisone sprays for pets are available and can be used for minor relief from itching until you can see your vet.
Is flea allergy dermatitis contagious to humans?No, flea allergy dermatitis is not contagious to people. However, if fleas are present on household pets, humans may be more susceptible to them and other diseases they can spread.
Is flea allergy dermatitis contagious to other pets?The dermatitis is not contagious to other pets. But the fleas will be happy to spread by jumping on another host, such as other pets in the household.

451,FIV in Cats,"What Is FIV in Cats?
FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that can eventually progress to feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (similar to AIDS in humans).

As those names imply, infection with FIV weakens a cat’s immune system, which makes it much more likely that they’ll come down with bacterial infections, certain types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, or other secondary health problems.

While FIV in cats is a serious disease, it’s important to keep two key points in mind:


	
	FIV infections aren’t very common. A study of more than 1,500 veterinary hospitals and animal shelters in the US and Canada showed that 3.6% of cats seen tested positive for FIV. This was likely an overestimate of the virus’s prevalence, since it excluded so many healthy cats.
	
	
	Cats with FIV can enjoy many healthy years after diagnosis. An FIV diagnosis in an otherwise healthy cat is not a medical emergency, although it could become one in the future.
	


Symptoms of FIV in Cats
FIV infections are divided into three phases that can have very different symptoms:

Acute phase—During the one to two weeks after a cat has been infected with FIV, a cat can have:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	No symptoms
	


Latent phase—After recovering from their first symptoms, cats often go through a period of several months to years when they seem perfectly healthy. However, their immune system is being slowly weakened.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome—At this point, a cat’s immune system has become weak enough that they start developing secondary infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers (lymphoma and leukemia, for example), and other health problems. Symptoms will vary with the specific secondary disease(s) a cat has, but commonly include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Redness or sores in the mouth
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Eye inflammation (redness and swelling) and drainage
	
	
	Coughing or sneezing
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Neurologic problems like weakness, seizures, or odd behaviors
	


As time goes on, many of these secondary health problems will get worse and stop responding to treatment.

Causes of FIV in Cats 
The most common way for cats to become infected with FIV is through bite wounds. A cat with FIV can have large amounts of the virus in their saliva. Cats may also develop FIV after touching an infected cat's saliva through mutual grooming or sharing food and water bowls, but this doesn’t happen often.

Cats who haven’t been spayed or neutered may be infected through sexual activity.

An infected queen (mother cat) can pass FIV to her kittens while they are growing in her uterus or when they drink her milk that has the virus. It’s possible for some kittens in a litter to be infected while others are not.

How Veterinarians Diagnose FIV in Cats
The most common way to diagnose FIV is with an ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which uses just a few drops of blood.

Results of ELISA tests for FIV are usually correct, but there are times when your vet will decide to run a confirmatory test.


	
	A cat was recently exposed to the virus—It can take two to four months for a cat to develop enough antibodies to be found by an ELISA test.
	
	
	The cat is younger than 6 months old—Kittens can pick up antibodies from their mother even if they are not infected, and it may take as long as six months for them to disappear.
	
	
	An apparently healthy cat tests positive for FIV and they have no history of being bitten by another cat—False positive tests are possible. For example, a vaccine for FIV that was stopped in 2016 makes vaccinated but uninfected cats test positive.
	


Be sure to tell your veterinarian about any symptoms you’ve seen at home, your cat’s past and present lifestyle, and your cat’s vaccination history so they can decide if a confirmatory test is needed.

Treatment of FIV in Cats
Unfortunately, cats cannot be cured of FIV, so treatment centers around managing the other conditions that they might have and keeping them as healthy as possible for as long as possible.

A veterinarian may need to run more diagnostic tests to get a better idea of the cat’s overall health and plan proper treatments, which may change over time.

General supportive care for cats with FIV includes:


	
	Keeping FIV-positive cats indoors so they come across fewer infectious diseases.
	
	
	Giving excellent nutrition and avoiding raw foods that may have pathogens.
	
	
	Quickly treating any diseases that do develop. Plan on checkups every four to six months so health problems can be caught early.
	


Anti-viral drugs such as AZT (azidothymidine or zidovudine) and medications that boost the immune system may be helpful in some cases, but they can also have significant side effects.

Your veterinarian can help you figure out if they might be right for your cat.

Recovery and Management of FIV in Cats
With a dedicated caregiver, cats with FIV often live long and relatively healthy lives. They may never develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, but if they do and their symptoms stop responding to treatment, they probably only have a couple of months to live.

Humane euthanasia is often the best way to prevent future suffering when a cat’s quality of life is poor and won’t get better.

Prevention of FIV in Cats
Since FIV in cats is usually transmitted through bites, the best form of prevention is to keep cats from fighting by keeping them indoors. It’s also important that any cat who has been diagnosed with FIV not be let outdoors so they can’t spread the disease to other cats.

Managing a household that includes FIV-positive and FIV-negative cats can get complicated.

Ideally, the two groups would be completely separated, but if that isn’t possible and they don’t usually fight, giving them separate water and food bowls is about all you can do.

There used to be a preventive vaccine for FIV, but it had limited effectiveness and was stopped in 2016.
FIV in Cats FAQsWhat happens if a cat is FIV-positive?Cats who don’t have any symptoms of their FIV infection can often live for years before they become sick. Some (but not all) of these cats eventually go on to have serious health problems.
How long do cats with FIV live? Research has shown that cats with FIV often enjoy the same lifespan as uninfected cats.

If differences are seen, they’re usually relatively small. For example, one study found that on average, FIV-positive cats who weren’t immediately humanely euthanized lived for 4.9 years after diagnosis compared to six years for uninfected cats.

452,Fibrotic Hardening of the Lungs in Cats,"Pulmonary Fibrosis in Cats



Cats can suffer from many forms of pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis being one of them. The development of this disease results in inflammation and scarring of the tiny air sacs of the cat's lungs and lung tissue. The reactive scarring of the lungs results in fibrotic tissue buildup, where the tissue becomes excessively thick, reducing the ability of the affected sacs to pass oxygen into the blood stream. Therefore, as the disease progresses, less oxygen is passed into the body’s tissues when the cat breathes.



The factors which initiate pulmonary fibrosis are still unknown; however, hereditary factors and a variety of micro-injuries to the air sacs are suspected. Recent evidence also suggests abnormal wound healing in the lung as a mechanism for fibrosis. It may exist concurrently with cancer in cats. Affected cats are usually middle-aged or elderly.



The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms and Types



The signs and symptoms displayed by the cat generally progress slowly; these include:




	Anorexia
	Cyanosis
	Lethargy
	Cough (nonproductive)
	Shortness of breath
	Increased respiratory rate and effort
	Open-mouth breathing/panting
	Exercise intolerance




Causes



The underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis is usually unknown (idiopathic). However, it may be also due to:




	Genetics
	Viral infection(s)
	Acute pancreatitis
	Toxins or drugs
	Oxygen toxicosis (a pathological condition caused by oxygen)
	Environmental damage (e.g., exposure to polluted air or cigarette smoke)




Diagnosis



The biggest problem in diagnosing and treating pulmonary fibrosis is that the disease may be far along before symptoms begin to appear.



Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and chest X-rays. Other diagnostic tools include an echocardiography to determine whether the heart is enlarged, a computed tomography (CT) scan to view the cat's lungs three dimensionally, and biopsy samples of the affected tissues for microscopic examination.







Treatment



Your cat may need supplemental oxygen; in which case, it will be hospitalized. This is a life-threatening disease and may be terminal if not treated immediately and appropriately. For that reason, treatment will focus on support, and on controlling the symptoms to enhance the quality of life.



If the cat is obese, there may be further treatment complications because it can impede ventilation (breathing). Weight loss will lessen symptoms of respiratory impairment.



Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory dosages of prednisone at first, tapering the dosage over the course of a month if there is no underlying infection. There are also some antifibrotic agents that may be helpful, as well as bronchodilators (drugs made to widen the air passages and relax the bronchial tissues) to assist your cat’s breathing.



Living and Management



You will need to eliminate the cat's exposure to dust or fumes. This is a progressive condition with a guarded prognosis; cats with pulmonary fibrosis generally only survive between a few weeks to a few months. Because of the possibility of quick deterioration, cats should be intensively monitored.



Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure often develops with any severe, chronic lung disease. Your veterinarian may want to repeat lung biopsies in order to track the cat's progress and the effectiveness of its treatment. A positive response to treatment will result in an increase in mobility.

453,Fever in Cats,"What Is Fever in Cats?
A cat’s normal body temperature is between 100 F and 102.5 F. But just like humans, cats can run a higher-than-normal body temperature when they are sick—or for other reasons.

A typical fever in a cat is considered a symptom until further diagnosis can confirm what is causing it. However, when a veterinarian can’t find an underlying cause, the cat may be diagnosed with what is called “a fever of unknown origin.”

Fever in cats may be due to:


	
	Excitement
	
	
	Anxiousness
	
	
	Pain
	
	
	Sickness
	
	
	Exercise
	
	
	Reaction to certain types of medications
	
	
	Heat exhaustion or heat stroke
	


An anxious, but otherwise healthy, cat with a 103 F temperature may not be considered feverish. On the other hand, a quiet and lethargic cat that has a 103 F temperature and shows other symptoms of illness may be considered feverish.

A veterinarian usually starts to interpret your cat’s body temperature by:


	
	Performing a thorough physical exam
	
	
	Examining your cat’s medical history
	


If the cause of the fever is not obvious, the veterinarian will then move on to diagnostic testing.

Symptoms of Fever in Cats
When your cat has a fever, they may:


	
	Feel lethargic
	
	
	Sleep more than usual
	
	
	Have a reduced appetite
	
	
	Hide
	
	
	Avoid activities they normally enjoy
	


Other symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea, are possible depending on what is causing a cat’s fever. If your cat has any worrisome symptoms, call your veterinarian for an appointment.

How To Tell If a Cat Has a Fever

In addition to seeing symptoms like reduced activity and appetite, you may suspect a fever if your cat feels warmer to the touch than usual. This can be confirmed at home with a rectal or ear thermometer.

The only accurate way to determine if your cat has a fever is to take their temperature. Rectal temperatures are more accurate than aural (ear) temperatures and are easy to perform if your cat is relatively laid-back. Follow the instructions for either the thermometer to determine when the reading is complete. Any thermometer used on animals should not be used later on people.

Causes of Fever in Cats
Persistent fevers that last more than a day may be caused by many potentially serious health problems, including:


	
	Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections affecting almost any organ in the body
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Immune-mediated diseases
	
	
	Trauma
	
	
	Inflammatory disorders
	
	
	A side effect of some medications
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Fever in Cats
Your veterinarian will first look at your cat’s medical history and ask you to list your cat’s symptoms and give details about their behavior.

Next, your veterinarian will physically examine your cat. This will include a temperature reading using a rectal or ear thermometer.

Sometimes, a physical exam may not show a reason for your cat’s fever and further procedures and lab tests may be needed, such as:


	
	Blood test for Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
	
	
	Blood test for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
	
	
	Complete blood count for infection or inflammation
	
	
	Biochemistry panel for abnormal organ function
	
	
	Urinalysis for urinary tract infection and kidney function
	
	
	Fecal examinations
	


Your veterinarian may also take X-rays or perform an ultrasound to look for abnormalities in your cat’s bones and internal organs.

Treating Fever in Cats
If a specific cause for the fever is found, treatment to address that cause should result in the fever going away. A cat with a fever may also receive:


	
	Fluids to treat or prevent dehydration
	
	
	Medications to ease discomfort and bring the fever down
	
	
	Nutritional support
	


If your cat is running a very high fever or is not eating and drinking, they may have to be hospitalized for treatment and close monitoring. This may include intravenous fluids and injectable medications.

Recovery and Management of Fever in Cats
Many cats respond well to treatment and will recover from a fever within one to five days unless the underlying cause can’t be cured or managed well.
Fever in Cats FAQsWhat can cause a fever in cats?Cats can have a fever for a variety of reasons. A very thorough workup may be necessary to identify the underlying cause, and some reasons, like a small abscess buried deep in the belly, for example, can hard to find. A veterinarian will ask about your cat’s medical history, perform a physical examination, and may recommend further testing to diagnose the cause of the fever.
How long do cat fevers last?Fevers in cats can last for just a few hours or for many days, depending on the underlying causes and how effectively it can be treated.
What should I do if my cat has a fever?Call your veterinarian for advice if you think your cat has a fever. Take your cat to the clinic immediately (even if it means going to an after-hours emergency vet) if your cat’s temperature is very high (over 104 F) or they have other serious symptoms like extreme lethargy, difficulty breathing, or severe vomiting and diarrhea.
Can parasites cause fevers in cats?Yes, parasites can cause fevers in cats. The most common parasites like fleas or intestinal worms usually won’t cause a fever, but other types, including the parasites that cause toxoplasmosis and cytauxzoonosis, can.
Do cats recover from fevers?Most cats will recover from a fever with appropriate treatment. However, some fevers may be a chronic or recurring problem depending on the underlying cause.
Will a cat’s fever go away on its own?Some cat fevers may go away on their own. For example, a cat with a mild upper respiratory infection will usually be back to normal in a week or so. However, fevers can also be a sign of a potentially life-threatening health problem. When in doubt, it’s always best to talk to your veterinarian.

454,Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV),"What Is Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)?
Feline leukemia virus is a common disease that affects about 2% of cats in the United States. It is spread cat-to-cat and leads to the destruction of the cat’s white blood cells and immune system. This 

leaves them more susceptible to infection, cancer, and death. Widespread vaccination has led to an overall decrease in leukemia cases; however, it remains a major disease in cats who frequent the outdoors.

The leukemia virus attacks the cat’s blood cells by invading tissue that makes up the blood cells, including bone marrow and lymph tissue. Blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) play an important role in keeping the body supplied with oxygen and nutrients. These cells help fight infections and eliminate waste products. White blood cells are especially important in helping the immune system, and special types of white blood cells are called to action when a cat is fighting an illness.

When a cat is infected with feline leukemia virus, its white blood cells have been compromised and are no longer able to help fight off infections. Various skin, respiratory, and urinary infections can develop without a healthy immune system in place. The affected cat is unable to fight off these infections, leading to a shorter life span. The virus also causes mutations leading to cancer, including lymphoma and lymphosarcoma.

 Symptoms of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Clinical signs of feline leukemia virus come from the blood cells being attacked. Initially, cats may show little signs of infection until the virus has strengthened and taken over more of their immune system. Over time, clinical signs may become more involved as cats develop cancers secondary to the leukemia virus.

The most common clinical signs of feline leukemia virus are:


	
	Pale gums (anemia)
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Unthrifty coat (poorly groomed, dry, brittle)
	
	
	Inflamed gums and mouth (gingivitis and stomatitis) 
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Chronic diarrhea
	
	
	Chronic skin, eye, respiratory, or urinary tract infections
	


Causes of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
FeLV in cats is spread through saliva. It is spread most commonly from those exposed to one another for longer periods of time through mutual grooming, mating, or shared food/water/litter boxes. It may also be spread by bite wounds and from a mother to her kittens through the placenta.

A cat at any age can be infected with feline leukemia virus through exposure. Allowing an unvaccinated cat to be unsupervised while outdoors may expose it to infected cats. Bringing a new cat into the home that has not tested negative for the feline leukemia virus may also spread the disease.

Fortunately, the virus is not very hardy in the environment and can only survive on surfaces for a couple of hours. Transmission usually occurs from direct contact between cats.

Feline leukemia virus is not contagious to people or to other pets, like dogs or rabbits.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Feline leukemia is usually diagnosed by a test that requires a small amount of blood, called an ELISA test. This test is quick and routinely done in veterinary clinics. Your veterinarian may recommend repeating the test if they get a positive result, especially in young cats and kittens. Repeating the test 8 to 12 weeks later helps to confirm if an infection is persistent. Some cat immune systems can eliminate the virus when they are first exposed. About 20 to 30 percent of cats will eliminate the virus successfully when they're first exposed.

FeLV undergoes several stages. In the first stage, infected cats show very little signs of disease as the virus enters their mouths and replicates on their tonsils. A little less than one-third of cats can eliminate the virus in this stage—if their immune system is healthy. For the remaining two-thirds of cats, the virus will spread to the lymph tissue and intestines, leading to shedding of viral particles in the feces in addition to the saliva. In advanced stages of the disease, it infects the bone marrow as well. Once the virus gets into the bone marrow it cannot be cleared and these cats are persistently infected for life.

Treatment of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Unfortunately, feline leukemia virus does not have a cure. Affected cats are managed medically by treating any secondary infections that can result from the disease. Cats infected with feline leukemia virus often develop secondary skin, upper respiratory tract, eye, or urinary tract infections due to their immune system being compromised.

Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat any secondary bacterial infections that may be present. Sometimes appetite stimulants or anti-inflammatory medications are prescribed in leukemia cat pet patients who have a poor appetite or fever. Occasionally, blood transfusions may be recommended for continued quality life for cats with severe anemia.

If your cat tests positive for feline leukemia virus, it is important to limit its exposure to secondary infections. It is best that she remains indoors only and does not have access to other cats that may have spreadable diseases. While a simple upper respiratory tract infection may be easily cleared by a healthy cat’s immune system, feline leukemia patients have a compromised immune system and will require more aggressive treatment and earlier intervention with antibiotics. Any illness, no matter how small, is a threat to a compromised immune system.

Recovery and Management of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)
Some cats diagnosed with FeLV can live normal lives for years, especially if they are kept indoors with minimal exposure to secondary illnesses. The average life span after testing positive for leukemia virus is less than three years. If your cat has feline leukemia and is allowed access to the outdoors, be sure it is under supervision. It is also important to prevent any cat interactions, such as fighting. If your cat enjoys the outdoors, but you want to limit its exposure to the elements, consider a catio. Always avoid allowing shared food/water bowls and litter boxes between affected and non-affected cats to reduce risk of transmission.

Management of a cat with feline leukemia may require more frequent cleaning of the eyes and ears to keep them free of debris. Secondary skin, respiratory, eye, ear and urinary tracts can be common in cats with compromised immune systems, so it’s helpful to keep them clean. Commercial ear cleaners, like Epi-Otic or Epi-Klean, can be used to clean out any waxy debris in the ear canals. Eye washes can be helpful in keeping the eyes clear.

Regular brushing will keep the skin and coat healthy. If any signs of infection are noted, such as green-yellowish drainage in the eyes or nose, lethargy, decreased appetite, cough, increased urination, or inflammation in the ears, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. Often, vets tend to be more proactive with antibiotics in a cat that has feline leukemia, since its immune system is not as robust.

Prevention of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)

You can reduce your cat’s risk of contracting feline leukemia with regular vaccination. It is recommended that cats who spend any time outdoors—or cats that have exposure to potentially infected cats—get an annual vaccination. The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends all kittens be vaccinated within their first year. Young kittens start the vaccine series at 8 weeks of age and receive a booster 3 to 4 weeks later. Cats at-risk should continue regular vaccination each year, while low risk indoor-only cats may discontinue the vaccine after the initial series. Vaccinated cats will not test positive on feline leukemia snap tests.

If a cat tests positive for feline leukemia, it should not be vaccinated, as it puts excess strain on its immune system. Any new cat should be tested for feline leukemia and FIV prior to being introduced to other cats in the household.

455,Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in Cats,"What Is Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in Cats?
Feline infectious peritonitis is a disease caused by a viral infection with a coronavirus that is specific to cats. This type of coronavirus cannot infect people or other species.  

FIP can be very difficult to diagnose because it can infect many organ systems, ranging from the abdomen to the eyes to the central nervous system. FIP symptoms also resemble symptoms from several other conditions, and the exact nature of your cat’s symptoms will depend on what form of the disease your cat has and which organs are affected.

Symptoms of Feline Infectious Peritonitis
A variety of symptoms can be seen in cats with FIP, depending on which organ system is affected. FIP can affect the liver, kidneys, pancreas, or other organ systems. 

Most cats will start showing symptoms of simply not feeling well—eating poorly, running a fever, or acting lethargic. Some animals will develop other diseases, depending on the type of the disease present. There are two main forms of FIP: 


	
	Wet (or effusive) form: Causes bloating and swelling in the abdomen (ascites) and may affect the heart and lungs. Cats with this form may pant and act sleepy or lethargic. 
	
	
	Dry (or non-effusive) form: Usually affects the eyes and may have neurological symptoms such as trouble with balance and seizures. 
	


These forms are mainly used for diagnostic purposes, and one cat may show symptoms from both forms. 

Because the symptoms associated with FIP are extremely varied and variable, it can be very hard to diagnose FIP based on clinical signs alone. Conditions that have similar symptoms include abdominal tumors, toxoplasmosis, infection with mycobacterium, and other conditions.

Causes of FIP in Cats
Feline infectious peritonitis is caused by a coronavirus that is unique to cats—it is not contagious to people, dogs, or other species of animal. This virus typically lives in the cat’s intestinal system. It’s spread through contact with feces in most cases, as infected cats shed the virus into litter boxes. Respiratory transmission is possible but less common. Because the most common route of infection is contact with feces, cats living in multi-cat households that share litter boxes are most likely to get infected.  

Infection with feline coronavirus is very common among cats, but it’s estimated that less than 5% of cats infected with feline coronavirus will go on to develop FIP. Cats with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of developing FIP, including kittens and cats with chronic diseases.

How Veterinarians Diagnose FIP in Cats
Diagnosis of FIP can be very challenging. The “wet form” that presents with abdominal swelling is relatively straightforward to diagnose by drawing a sample of fluid from the abdomen for analysis. For other cats, additional testing may be required to piece together the puzzle and suggest FIP.  

There is no completely reliable FIP test available to run on living cats. A conclusive diagnosis sometimes comes with a necropsy (the animal version of an autopsy) after the cat passes away. In most cases, many tests need to be run to rule out other diseases, leaving FIP as the most likely possibility.

Recovery and Management of FIP in Cats
Traditionally, FIP has been considered universally fatal. Many cats cannot be conclusively diagnosed with FIP until they pass away. 

Only in recent times has a promising medication come to light, but it is not legally available in the United States at this time. Some owners have purchased it on the black market, but unfortunately, this comes with significant risks, including: 


	
	No quality control of the medication  
	
	
	No way to know if you are getting the active compound  
	
	
	Medication is sold at exorbitant prices  
	


Hopefully, there will soon be research to substantiate this medication’s use, but until then, it’s not recommended that cat parents try to self-treat their animals.  

Conventional treatment for FIP focuses on minimizing the clinical symptoms that are interfering with the cat’s quality of life—but FIP is inevitably fatal without definitive treatment, and supportive care is the best we can offer most cats. 
FIP in Cats FAQsWhat are the first signs of FIP in cats?Typically, the first signs of FIP in cats are simply signs that the cat is not feeling well—excessive tiredness, poor appetite/weight loss, and fever.
Are cats with FIP in pain?Cats with FIP do not appear to be in any pain. However, they seem to feel much like we do with a case of the flu—tired and wiped out.
How is FIP transmitted in cats?Most cats are exposed early in their lives to the organism that causes FIP—sometimes even from their mother. Cats almost universally carry the organism responsible for the infection—however, the development of disease requires a specific interaction between the immune system of the cat and a mutated form of the organism. Therefore, although many cats carry the organism, the vast majority never develop disease. This is also the primary reason we do not have a diagnostic test for the disease—there are more factors at play than simply carrying the organism.
Is FIP in cats contagious to other cats?We don’t consider FIP too contagious in the way so many other diseases are, primarily because almost all cats are exposed to the organism early in life and carry it long-term without symptoms. The development of disease requires a specific interaction between the virus and the immune system. It is not uncommon to see one cat in a household die of FIP while the other cats remain perfectly healthy.
Can FIP cause blindness in cats?Yes, it can. In fact, in some infected cats, changes associated with the eyes may be the only symptoms seen, although for most animals, multiple signs are present.
Is there a vaccine for FIP in cats?There is a vaccine for feline coronavirus, but it has some drawbacks. Unfortunately, vaccinating cats in multi-cat households may not be effective, since infection with feline coronavirus is so common that most cats will already have been infected by the time they are old enough to receive the vaccine. The vaccine is only approved for kitten older than 16 weeks of age. Because of these limitations, the American Association of Feline Practitioners does not recommend routine use of the FIP vaccine.

456,Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) in Cats,"What Is Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) in Cats?
Feline idiopathic cystitis, also known as feline interstitial cystitis or FIC for short, is a type of feline lower urinary tract disease that causes inflammation of the bladder in cats.  

 “Idiopathic” means that the cause of the disease process is unknown; “interstitial” refers to the location of the inflammation in the interstitium, which is the space between the cells in the bladder. This inflammation leads to a thickening of the bladder wall, which can be seen on an ultrasound or during cystoscopy (a procedure in which a scope is used to view the bladder).  

FIC causes symptoms that mimic a urinary tract infection (UTI). The key difference: a UTI is caused by bacteria, while FIC is considered a sterile disease (no bacteria are present).  

 

That doesn’t mean FIC is harmless, however. If the inflammation becomes severe enough, it can cause an obstruction (blockage) of the urinary tract and prevent your cat from being able to urinate, which is a medical emergency. If you notice your cat is straining to urinate, contact your nearest animal hospital immediately.  

Symptoms of Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
Common symptoms of FIC may include:  


	
	Straining to urinate 
	
	
	Urinating more often (more frequent trips to the litter box) 
	
	
	Urinating smaller amounts more frequently 
	
	
	Blood in the urine 
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box, especially on cool, smooth surfaces such as tile or hardwood floors 
	



	
	Licking excessively at the genital region 
	
	
	Crying out or meowing while urinating 
	
	
	Lack of energy 
	
	
	Decreased appetite 
	
	
	Vomiting or diarrhea 
	



	
	Decreased social interaction (hiding) 
	


If your cat’s urethra (the tube through which urine leaves the body) has become obstructed (blocked), they will produce little to no urine and cry out often. They also will likely exhibit many of the other signs listed above. This is a medical emergency. Please seek veterinary care immediately.  

Causes of Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
No one knows what causes FIC. Idiopathic means that the cause of a disease process is unknown. 

FIC occurs most often in young- to middle-aged cats that are less than 10 years old. Cats that are overweight are also at higher risk. Male cats are most prone to this problem, but females can also develop it. Experts believe that stress plays a role, as cats who experience sudden changes to their routine or environment and cats that live in multi-cat households are more likely to develop FIC.   

How Veterinarians Diagnose Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
FIC is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that your vet will diagnose it only after ruling out all other potential conditions that might cause similar symptoms. This process can be expensive and stressful, but it is necessary.  

Conditions to rule out before diagnosing FIC include: 


	Bladder stones 
	
	Urinary tract infection (UTI) 
	
	
	Urethral obstruction (blockage of the urethra); this can also occur secondary to FIC 
	
	
	Cancer  
	
	
	Acute kidney injury 
	
	
	Idiopathic renal hematuria, a rare condition that causes kidney bleeding 
	
	
	Blood clotting disorders 
	
	
	Toxin ingestion 
	
	
	Prostate disease (rare in cats) 
	


In order to check for these other conditions, your vet might recommend one or more of the following tests:  

Urinalysis  

Your vet will use a small needle to penetrate your cat’s bladder and collect a sterile sample of urine that is analyzed in a lab. (A “free catch” sample—which entails collecting urine after your cat has voided naturally—can be used, but it won’t be sterile and might lead to a false positive for a UTI.) If your cat has a UTI, lab analysis will detect bacteria in the urine. In a cat with FIC, the results will likely be abnormal (crystals, blood, protein, white blood cells, or skin cells may be present in the urine), but bacteria won’t be present.   

Urine Culture 

This takes urinalysis a step further by placing the sample in a petri dish and keeping it in a warm, dark incubator to allow any bacteria that might be present to grow. It’s the most accurate way to ensure your cat does not have a UTI. If your cat does have a UTI, the bacteria grown will be tested against different antibiotics to determine which ones would be most effective to treat the UTI.  

Urine Protein: Creatinine Ratio (UPC) 

This test compares the level of protein in the urine to the level of creatinine, a substance excreted by the kidneys. In healthy cats, the amount of protein is significantly less than the amount of creatinine. UPC is often elevated in cats with FIC.   

Abdominal X-rays 

A basic imaging test is often used to look for both bladder and/or kidney stones. Sometimes contrast dye is used so that the vet can see whether the urethra is blocked or thickened.  

Abdominal Ultrasound  

This test uses soundwaves instead of radiation to look for abnormalities in the bladder and kidneys, including stones.   

Urethrocystoscopy (Scoping the Bladder)  

Your vet will put a scope (thin tube with an attached camera) into the urethra and bladder to view the bladder wall and check for cancer.   

Exploratory Cystotomy With Histopathology 

This is a type of surgery in which the bladder is cut open so your vet can look for signs of cancer and take samples of the bladder wall to send to a lab for analysis.   

Urethrocystoscopy and exploratory cystotomy are typically reserved for cats that experience persistent or frequent, recurrent episodes of FIC and are used primarily to rule out bladder cancer, which is rare in cats.  

Treatment of Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)
Because the cause of FIC is unknown, there’s no medication that directly treats it. The most important aspect of managing FIC is to ease your cat’s discomfort. Your vet might prescribe pain relievers such as butorphanol or buprenorphine, which are low-dose opioids. Gabapentin is a drug in a different class that may also be used to control pain.  

If your cat’s urethra is blocked, it will require much more extensive treatment. After the initial emergent treatment, some of the medications your vet might prescribe include, but are not limited to acepromazine, prazosin or phenoxybenzamine, which are medications designed to help the urethra relax. Unfortunately, one of the main causes of the blockage is inflammation, and these medications don’t address the underlying inflammation.  

Given that inflammation is a big part of FIC, you might assume that your vet would advise taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like meloxicam. Unfortunately, no studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs help with FIC.  

Some vets also recommend injections of a polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG) such as Adequan. This is a drug that is typically used for joint issues to help prevent the breakdown of cartilage in the joint. However, the bladder also happens to be lined by this substance. In cats with FIC, recent studies have shown that they have a breakdown of the PSGAG layer on the bladder wall, and the injections may help to replace it. While it hasn’t been directly proven, it is suspected that PSGAG injections may help cats to recover faster from an FIC episode.   

Recovery and Management of Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC)  
There are several things that can be done to help your cat recover from FIC and prevent future episodes.   

Prescription Diets 

One change is a switch to a prescription diet that is high in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, which combat inflammation. Your vet might recommend Hill’s c/d, Hill’s c/d Multicare Urinary Stress, Royal Canin Urinary SO, or Royal Canin Multicare Urinary and Calm.

It has not been proven but drinking more water might help prevent FIC from returning. Feeding your cat an exclusively wet-food diet and using a water fountain may help to increase water consumption. Cats tend to like running water better than still water. 

Environmental Enrichment  

Environmental enrichment helps to decrease stress in cats, which is suspected to be a major factor involved in causing FIC. Increase more activity time with your cat, and consider providing extra climbing structures, viewing, and resting perches, and scratching posts. Also make sure that you’re frequently changing the litterbox and that you have an appropriate number of litterboxes in your home. It may surprise you, but the recommended number of litterboxes is one more than the number of cats you have.  

Feliway 

A synthetic version of a calming cat pheromone Feliway may help to decrease stress and, in turn, reduce the chances of future FIC episodes.

L-Tryptophan and Alpha-Casozepine are supplements that may help to decrease stress in cats, but more research on them is needed. Acupuncture might also help cats who routinely experience FIC.  
Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) in Cats FAQsHow long does idiopathic cystitis last in cats?Symptoms can usually go away on their own in five to seven days unless the urethra becomes blocked.
Do cats outgrow idiopathic cystitis?No. It’s unclear why some cats have recurrent episodes, but others do not. Research has shown that 46% of cats who have an episode will never have another one, but an unlucky 12% have more than six recurrences.
Can feline idiopathic cystitis be cured?Cats can recover from an episode of FIC. However, approximately 50% of them will have a recurrent episode within one year, so they should be monitored closely.
How long do cats with feline idiopathic cystitis live? They can have a normal lifespan, as long as FIC is managed and treated appropriately.

457,Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Cats,"What Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Cats?
Like the human heart, the feline heart has four chambers—two smaller chambers on the top, the left and right atrium, and two larger chambers on the bottom, the left and right ventricle.

The function of the right atrium is to pump deoxygenated blood from the body into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to pick up more oxygen for use by the body and release carbon dioxide for disposal. The function of the left atrium is to pump oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood back to the body to allow proper cellular and organ function. Because the left ventricle needs to push oxygenated blood to the body, its muscular walls are thicker than those of the right ventricle.

When the walls of the left ventricle become fully enlarged and excessively thickened, the result is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The narrowing of the inner chamber of the left ventricle, due to this muscular thickening, prevents it from filling properly and decreases its efficiency. As a result, less oxygen-rich blood can reach the body to keep it functioning correctly and it causes the heart to beat faster than normal, increasing its need for oxygen and causing the death of heart muscle cells.  This can also hamper heart function.

HCM is the most common heart disease in cats. As many as 1 in 7 will develop HCM at some point in their lives, and most show no symptoms.
Causes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats
One of the most common causes is an inherent disease of the heart muscle itself. This is often related to a genetic predisposition to HCM that is present in several cat breeds, including:


	
	Maine Coons
	
	
	Persians
	
	
	Ragdolls
	
	
	Chartreux
	
	
	Sphynx
	
	
	Norwegian Forest 
	
	
	Bengals
	
	
	Turkish Vans
	
	
	American Shorthairs
	
	
	British Shorthairs
	


These breeds are most affected by HCM because they are more likely to carry a mutation in a gene called A31P that is involved in maintaining healthy heart muscles. In cats that have two abnormal copies of this gene, death of heart muscle cells and scar tissue in the wall of the left ventricle occurs, which prevents the heart from functioning properly.

In addition to genetics, there can be several medical causes of HCM in cats. Hormonal conditions such as hyperthyroidism or acromegaly (excessive secretion of a growth hormone because of a tumor in the anterior pituitary gland near the brain) can stimulate growth of the muscular walls of the left ventricle. Cancer in the heart can also increase the size and thickness of the walls of the left ventricle.

Other diseases unrelated to the heart, such as kidney disease, can cause high blood pressure in the body, which puts additional strain on the left ventricle as it works harder than normal to pump blood to the body against elevated pressure in the vessels. Over time, this increased effort causes the ventricle walls to become thicker, and the interior chamber narrower.  
Symptoms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats

	
	Loss of appetite
	
	
	Heart murmurs
	
	
	Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)
	
	
	Blood clots, which can cause pain/vocalization, trouble walking, cold rear limbs, vomiting, and trouble breathing
	
	
	Heart failure
	
	
	Fluid in lungs, causing crackles and wheezes when breathing
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Fluid in abdomen (ascites), causing visible abdominal swelling
	
	
	Abnormal gum color: pale, gray, or blue
	
	
	Blue foot pads and nailbeds
	
	
	Weak or unstable pulse
	
	
	Tiring easily during play/exercise
	
	
	Lethargy/weakness
	
	
	Fainting/collapse
	
	
	Sudden death
	

How Veterinarians Diagnose Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats
A veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam, focusing on listening to the heart and lungs for any abnormal heart rhythms, murmurs, and any excessive crackling and wheezing during breathing. They will also examine the cat’s feet and nail beds for signs of poor circulation, feeling carefully for any weak or unsteady pulses in the limbs, as well as look for any abnormal colors in the gums, such as blue, gray, or pale. The cat’s overall demeanor and ability to walk will also be assessed. HCM can cause lethargy and trouble walking in some cats, particularly if the cat has developed secondary blood clots because of it.

Following the physical exam, blood work, including a thyroid panel, will be performed to determine if there is a medical condition that might cause HCM. X-rays may be helpful in screening for HCM, but it can be missed, depending upon the angle of the image. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can also be used to pick up any abnormal heart rhythms.

The best way to diagnose HCM in cats is the echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart that allows a fuller picture of the thickness of the left ventricle, the flow of blood between heart chambers, and other features of heart function that are best examined as the heart is pumping in real time.
Treatment of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats
A variety of medications can help cats that have HCM:


	
	Clopidogrel: medication that helps prevent blood clots.
	
	
	Diltiazem: a medication that can prevent some fluid buildup and reduce the thickness of the left ventricular wall in some cats.
	
	
	Beta blockers: medications such as atenolol can help cats with severe HCM by slowing heart rate in cats with tachycardia (an overly fast heart rate), correcting abnormal heart rhythms, and improving the function of the valves between the chambers of the heart.

	
		
		Beta blockers can also decrease blood pressure in cats with hypertension.
		
	
	
	
	ACE inhibitors: medications such as benazepril are often prescribed to cats with HCM who have heart failure. It can reduce blood pressure.
	
	
	Aspirin: used to thin the blood and prevent clotting in cats with HCM.
	
	
	Warfarin: another blood-thinning medication that can help prevent blood clots
	
	
	Furosemide or Lasix®: a common medication prescribed for cats who have congestive heart failure due to HCM.
	
	
	Spironolactone: another diuretic medication that is used in cats with HCM and heart failure to remove fluid buildup. Spironolactone is often used along with Lasix®.
	
	
	Nitroglycerin ointment: can be applied inside the ears of cats to treat severe fluid buildup when administered along with Lasix®. It can also improve blood flow to the body by relaxing the ventricles and arteries, so they are able to accommodate more blood.
	
	
	Pimobendan: can help increase the function of the left atrium and left ventricle during the pumping phase of the heart cycle, when the heart is pushing blood from the left ventricle to the body.
	


In addition to medications, some cats may need routine pleurocentesis, a procedure that removes excess fluid from the lungs. Cats with severe, acute HCM and heart failure may need oxygen therapy in the hospital. Cats that suddenly develop heart failure may benefit from being put under anesthesia, intubated, and helped to breathe if respiratory failure occurs.

Anxious cats may be given sedatives such as acepromazine to keep them calm, as stress can cause breathing difficulties and increase the risk of heart failure in cats with HCM.
Recovery and Management of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Cats
Unfortunately, HCM has no cure. Cats with no symptoms may live a normal lifespan, but the disease usually worsens. If symptoms develop, cats will generally survive for about two more years. Survival time is generally shorter, perhaps only six months or less, for cats that have blood clots, congestive heart failure, and/or low body temperature. If your cat requires hospitalization, a few things can be done when your cat is home to maintain your cat stable for as long as possible.

Stress can hinder breathing and increase the risk of heart failure in cats. It is important to set up a quiet space for your cat where he can rest away from any noise and activity of people and other pets. Providing easy access to food, water, litter boxes, and soft perches near windows can benefit your cat immensely.

Diet is another factor that can improve the quality of life for cats with HCM. Because HCM, especially with congestive heart failure, can cause loss of appetite, it is essential that cats be fed a high-quality, enticing food that is high in protein. This may require switching from wet food to dry food or vice versa.

Low-sodium broths or food toppers such as Purina® Beyond Mixers Immune Support can encourage cats with lower appetites to eat more. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oils, can decrease inflammation that is often responsible for muscle wasting and low appetite in cats. A liquid supplement such as Nutramax® Welactin is a great addition to your cat’s food.

Cats on medications for congestive heart failure may lose too much vitamin B in their urine and require vitamin B supplements. Work closely with your veterinarian to determine what the best diet and supplements may be for your cat, based on their condition.

Prevention of HCM in Cats

Since HCM can be inherited or may be the result of other medical conditions, the disease is difficult to prevent. Reputable breeders should test susceptible cat breeds for mutations in the A31P gene so that kittens produced from breeding stock do not inherit two mutated copies of the gene.

General care and proper nutrition for all cats can go a long way to supporting heart health and prolonging the asymptomatic stage of HCM. It is crucial for higher-risk cats (senior cats, cats with predisposed conditions, cats with the A31P gene) to be screened annually for any signs of heart disease.

If you are concerned about HCM in your cat, it is best to speak with your veterinarian about her overall risk, which diagnostic tests are most appropriate, and how often those tests are needed. Your veterinarian can also assist with developing a wellness and nutrition plan at home to ensure your cat has the best and longest possible life.

458,Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome (Twitchy Cat Syndrome),"What Is Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome?
Feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FHS) is also called rolling skin disease and twitchy cat syndrome, which should give you an idea of what signs to look out for in your cat. FHS generally involves muscle contractions that your cat cannot control, along with changes in behavior.

FHS remains poorly understood and may have neurological, psychological, or dermatological (skin) causes. A variety of other conditions that can look very similar must be ruled out before feline hyperesthesia syndrome is diagnosed.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
A cat with feline hyperesthesia syndrome typically has intermittent bursts or episodes of signs lasting 20–30 seconds. During these episodes, you may observe any of the following symptoms:


	
	Rippling or twitching of skin on the lower back (both after touch and for no apparent reason)
	
	
	Dilated pupils
	
	
	Brief bursts of jumping and running, as if startled
	
	
	Excessive meowing and other noises
	
	
	Tail-chasing
	
	
	Biting or licking the lower back, sides, hind paws, rear, or tail
	
	
	Pain or discomfort when petted or touched
	
	
	Tiredness
	


If you touch your cat during an FHS episode, you could make the signs worse, and your cat might become aggressive. Your cat will not have control over this.

If you notice your cat’s back twitching or any of the other signs listed above, it’s best to stay calm and try not to handle your cat during an episode, even though the signs can be severe and even frightening.

Causes of Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
Nobody knows what causes feline hyperesthesia syndrome. Because different cats with hyperesthesia respond to different types of treatment, there may be multiple underlying causes. In some cats, feline hyperesthesia syndrome is diagnosed along with another underlying condition.

Causes of feline hyperesthesia syndrome are usually considered dermatological (skin problems), neurological (problems with the nervous system), or psychological (mental health problems). Each of these may have different triggers for FHS episodes.

Dermatological Causes of FHS


	
	Allergies
	
	
	Immune-system-related disease
	


Neurological Causes of FHS


	
	Seizures
	
	
	Neuropathic (nerve) pain
	


Psychological Causes of FHS


	
	Displacement behavior
	
	
	Compulsive behavior
	
	
	Attention-seeking behavior
	


Food hypersensitivity may also contribute to FHS. In recent research, one cat with hyperesthesia had symptoms disappear after trying a hydrolyzed protein diet.

Cat Breeds Prone to Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome

Feline hyperesthesia syndrome can happen in any cat, though it may be found more frequently in Abyssinian, Burmese, Persian, and Siamese cats.

FHS is also more common among younger cats. In two studies, the average age when feline hyperesthesia syndrome symptoms were first noticed was around the first year of the cat’s life, and most cats with the condition were under 7 years old.

How Vets Diagnose Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
If your cat is showing mild to moderate signs of feline hyperesthesia syndrome, contact your vet within 24 hours. If a severe episode occurs and lasts longer than two to three minutes, take your cat to an emergency vet as soon as possible.

Your vet may perform the following tests:


	
	A dermatological (skin) workup to identify possible flea allergies, even if your cat does not go outdoors.
	
	
	An evaluation for pain or a neurological condition.
	
	
	Medication trials may be part of the workup process. When cats are under stress, they can be very good at hiding signs of pain or discomfort. Evaluating their response to a medication targeting pain or itchiness, for example, can provide valuable information.
	


Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome Treatment
Once other conditions have been ruled out and feline hyperesthesia is diagnosed, your veterinarian may need to consult with or refer you to a veterinary behaviorist for a full treatment plan. Your treatment plan may include:


	
	Changes to the environment
	
	
	Medication or supplements
	
	
	Behavior modification
	


The purpose of treatment is to make changes that help reduce the number of episodes. Behavior modification will give your cat a different emotional response or behavior to perform during times of stress.

Recovery and Management of Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome
In one study, six out of seven cats showed significant improvement with medication, and five cats had resolution with just one medication. For some cats with hyperesthesia, the episodes may come back after several months. For others, the relief lasts much longer.
Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome FAQsWhy is my cat twitching?Twitching in cats can be caused by many possible medical conditions ranging from mild to serious, including seizures, toxin ingestion, infections, pain, feline hyperesthesia syndrome, and more. If your pet has developed new twitching, it’s best to try to record the episode on video and contact your veterinarian immediately.

If the episode lasts more than a few minutes or reoccurs more than twice in a 24-hour period, this should be treated like a medical emergency. Take your pet to the closest emergency veterinary hospital immediately. 
Can a cat survive feline hyperesthesia syndrome?Yes, though treatment is often necessary to ensure a good quality of life.
Is feline hyperesthesia syndrome genetic?There is no evidence of a genetic link in feline hyperesthesia syndrome at this time.
At what age does feline hyperesthesia syndrome happen?It is most common in young cats, under 7 years old. Symptoms typically begin appearing in cats at 1 year of age.
Why does feline hyperesthesia syndrome happen?While it has been associated with skin conditions, pain disorders, neurological problems, and psychological disorders, the underlying reason is largely unknown.
How do I help my cat with feline hyperesthesia syndrome?See your vet for a thorough workup of potential causes. Your vet may consult with a veterinary behaviorist to create the best plan for your cat.

459,Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection,"What Is Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection?
In cats, the feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is a virus affecting primarily the upper respiratory tract and the structures of the eye. Transmission occurs between cats by direct contact with infected oral, nasal, or eye secretions. Within 24 hours, a newly infected cat can transmit the feline herpes virus to other cats, so it’s important to seek veterinary care immediately.  

FHV-1 is the most common viral cause of sneezing and nasal discharge in cats. Changes to the structures of the eye are also associated with feline herpes infection. 

Young cats are most affected, but infection can occur at any age. Cats from multi-cat households, shelters, rescues, and catteries are at increased risk for infection. Outdoor, stray, and feral cats may become infected from contact with infected cats while outside. 

Symptoms of Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection
Clinical signs can vary in severity. Upper respiratory signs include: 


	
	Sneezing 
	



	
	Nasal discharge  
	
	
	Fever 
	
	
	Loss of appetite 
	
	
	Coughing 
	


Changes to the eye may include: 


	
	Eye discharge 
	
	
	Conjunctivitis (pink eye) or chemosis (enlargement of the pink lining of the eye) 
	
	
	Changes in the color of the eye 
	
	
	Corneal ulcer (scratches or tears of the clear part of the eye) 
	


In severe cases, changes to the skin around the face may include: 


	
	Redness 
	
	
	Swelling 
	
	
	Crusting 
	



	
	Loss of hair 
	


Causes of Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection
The feline herpes virus attacks the lining of the nose, tonsils, conjunctiva (lining of the eye), and cornea (visible part of the eyeball). As the virus continues to replicate (make copies of itself), it may be spread through secretions or close direct contact. If not treated early, the virus can infiltrate the bones associated with the nose and mouth, causing long-term physical damage.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection
The most sensitive test for feline herpes virus is a PCR test, which is conducted on swabs from deep in the mouth, the eye, or on biopsies from the skin. This test, however, does not differentiate between the active form of infection and a chronic carrier state.

A positive result could mean the pet was infected from another sick cat and is now a carrier of the virus, the pet has been vaccinated for feline herpes, or the pet is showing signs from an active infection of feline herpes. Therefore, a diagnosis is usually made based on the physical exam, symptoms, and the pet's history.

Treatment of Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection
Treatment depends on the severity of disease, vaccine status, age, and underlying health conditions.  

Currently, there are no specific medications for the herpes virus in cats; however, in severe cases, human antiviral medications, like Famciclovir, can help. Famciclovir may reduce clinical signs and decrease the virus shedding in the secretions of infected cats. For pets with symptoms affecting the eye, topical eye medications may be used. 

Supportive care is the foundation of treating pets affected by the feline herpes virus. Supportive care is aimed at decreasing more severe symptoms like pneumonia and physical damage to the nose and eye structures. Traditionally, the virus is active for 7 to 10 days, so in mild cases, pets may require no treatment as symptoms improve.  

Supportive care can include fluids for hydration and routine cleaning of the nostrils and eyes (if they are affected). Also, lysine immune supplements decrease the virus’s ability to replicate. These supplements are available as a powder, paste, or treat. Probiotics with Enterococcus faecium SF68 support the immune system.  

In severe cases, a cat may need to be stabilized in the hospital before supportive care can be started at home. 

Since antibiotics work against bacteria, they are not used in every case of infection with the feline herpes virus. If a secondary bacterial infection is present, antibiotics are used to fight that infection while the virus runs its course.

Recovery and Management of Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection
When caught early, most cats with symptoms due to the herpes virus will recover in 10-14 days with supportive care. Death may occur with severe disease symptoms, especially in kittens and cats that are immunosuppressed. 

In severe cases, or when cats are affected when very young, physical damage to the bony structures of the face can occur, causing deformities and scarring. That physical damage predisposes affected cats to further complications like pneumonia, chronic nasal disease, and recurrent flares of infection. 

Prevention of FHV-1 


	
	Isolation of sick cats: Separate cats showing signs of an upper respiratory disease, or those with abnormal eye discharge, from other cats. When separated, allow your affected pet to have use of an individual water bowl, food bowl, litter box, toys, and bedding. 
	
	
	Clean shared spaces and items: FHV-1 is very susceptible to disinfectants. The feline herpes virus survives only 18 hours outside of the host. It is easily inactivated by bleach. 
	
	
	Reduce stressors: Provide cats that are housed together enough space to drink and eat and use a litter box without crowding or aggression. Maintain a normal routine of deworming, enrichment, and rest. Adding pheromone therapy (like Feliway) reduces stress for cats. 
	
	
	Vaccinate: There is a vaccine to decrease the symptoms associated with herpes virus infection in cats. This combination vaccine protects against feline herpes, feline calicivirus, and feline panleukopenia (feline distemper). Starting at 6-9 weeks of age, cats can receive their first combination vaccine. Booster vaccines are required every 3-4 weeks until 16 weeks of age. For appropriate protection, this requires at least two vaccines. If the booster vaccine is not given within the appropriate window, cats are not properly protected and are at risk for developing symptoms. Cats are considered protected two to three weeks after their last vaccine in the series.  
	


It is possible for vaccinated cats to become infected with the feline herpes virus and become chronic carriers. But when vaccinated, those cats develop milder symptoms and shed less of the virus for a shorter amount of time compared to unvaccinated cats.  
Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection FAQsIs feline herpesvirus contagious to other cats?The feline herpes virus is very contagious to other cats. Transmission usually occurs between cats by direct contact with eye, nasal, or oral discharges and secretions from an affected cat. Transmission can also occur between shared toys, food or water bowls, and bedding material.
How long do cats with FHV-1 live?Cats that clear the infection are carriers of the virus for life. As chronic carriers, recurrent active infections (when cats show signs and can transmit disease) can occur. These flares are often associated with stress or another underlying disease process. Flares are treated similarly to initial infections. Good management will reduce the frequency and severity of flares. By managing stressors, and remaining current on vaccines, a pet infected with feline herpes can live a normal lifespan.
Is FHV-1 contagious to humans?Although a herpes virus affects people, it is not the same one that affects cats. The feline herpes virus only affects cats, and the human herpes virus only affects humans.
Is FHV-1 curable in cats?There is not a cure for a cat affected by the FHV-1 virus. However, if you provide routine care and recognize symptoms early, your cat can lead a normal life.

460,Feline Foamy Virus Infection in Cats,"Feline foamy virus (FeFV) is a complex retrovirus (uses RNA as its DNA) that infects cats, apparently without causing disease. Some strains, however, induce differentiated lymphocytes to burst, suggesting a potential impact on the cat's immune function. Part of the Spumavirus genus, FeFV is relatively rare and is more prevalent in free-roaming cats. The prevalence of the virus in cats also increases with age.

Symptoms and Types

Most FeFV-positive cats are asymptomatic and in good health. However, some experts suggest that the infection is linked with myeloproliferative disease and chronic progressive polyarthritis, possibly due to the high likelihood of co-infection with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In these cases, the cat will demonstrate swollen joints, abnormal gait, and enlarged lymph nodes.

Causes

The way FeFV is transmitted is somewhat under dispute. The high prevalence of infection in some cat populations suggests casual contact may play a role in transmission, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Also, since free-roaming cats are at greater risk of FeFV infection, it may be transmitted through bites. It, too, has been discovered to transmit frequently from infected queens to their offspring, probably while still in the womb.

Co-infections with FIV and FeLV are fairly common, perhaps due to shared transmission modes and risk factors. Despite this, FeFV co-infection has not been proven to enhance early development of FIV infections.



Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel.

A blood sample may be taken for serologic testing, which assist in identifying FeFV antibodies.  However, this testing is not readily available and not particularly useful because the correlation between FeFV infection and the disease is so tenuous.  Veterinarians may also examine joint fluid from cats with chronic progressive polyarthritis.

Treatment

Currently there is no course of treatment for cats with FeFV infections, except for prescribing immunosuppressive medications to those with chronic progressive polyarthritis. Caution must be used with cats that are also infected with FIV or FeLV.

Adverse reactions are unlikely with cats only suffering from FeFV. Animals that also have chronic progressive polyarthritis, on the other hand, often have a poor prognosis for long-term recovery."," and Types

Most FeFV-positive cats are asymptomatic and in good health. However, some experts suggest that the infection is linked with myeloproliferative disease and chronic progressive polyarthritis, possibly due to the high likelihood of co-infection with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In these cases, the cat will demonstrate swollen joints, abnormal gait, and enlarged lymph nodes.

461,Feline Distemper in Cats,"What Is Feline Distemper in Cats? 
Feline panleukopenia virus, also known as feline distemper, is a highly contagious, life-threatening infectious disease in cats. Feline panleukopenia virus is closely related to canine parvovirus.

Feline distemper mostly affects kittens and unvaccinated cats. The virus enters a cat’s body through the nose or mouth. A cat’s immune system determines the number of viral particles that enter the body.

Usually, the virus invades the bone marrow and intestines within two to seven days of a cat encountering the virus. It infects and kills the rapidly growing and dividing cells in the body.

The virus suppresses the production of all white blood cells in the bone marrow. These cells are important to the immune system and are used to fight infection. Without them, cats are vulnerable to spreading the virus.

Feline distemper is found everywhere in the environment and can live for years.

The virus can survive anywhere—from the environment it was shed upon to shoes, paws, bedding, bowls, and litter boxes. Feline distemper can survive at freezing temperatures and room temperatures, and can also survive the use of certain disinfectants, including iodine and alcohol.

Feline panleukopenia virus is considered one of the deadliest cat diseases in the unvaccinated cat population. Kittens, cats with compromised immune systems, and pregnant cats are at the highest risk to develop severe symptoms of feline distemper.

The feline distemper vaccine for cats is a core vaccine, and all cats should be vaccinated against this virus.

Feline distemper can be fatal if not properly diagnosed and treated.

Symptoms of Feline Distemper in Cats
Symptoms of distemper in cats can range from mild to severe and may include the following:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Painful abdomen (when touched or may appear tense and distended without touch)
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Rough or unkempt hair coat
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Decreased to absent appetite
	
	
	Collapse (in severe cases)
	
	
	Bruising of the skin or gums (in severe cases)
	


Kittens with feline distemper will have mild to severe intention tremors and a wide-based stance. They may fall frequently or seem uncoordinated.

Causes of Feline Distemper in Cats
Cats become infected with this virus in utero due to their mother becoming infected while pregnant or being exposed to it in their environment. Kittens can also be infected through breast milk when feeding from their mother.  

Cats with feline distemper will shed viral particles into the environment through feces, urine, saliva, and vomit. Infection occurs when at-risk cats are in contact with these particles. An infected cat sheds the virus for a day or two.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Feline Distemper in Cats
Feline distemper can look like many other conditions, such as feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus.

Your veterinarian will take a thorough medical history and perform blood work to confirm a diagnosis. Feline panleukopenia is suspected when exposure history is correlated with very low white blood cells and possibly low red blood cells.

Fecal testing for feline panleukopenia virus can be performed but is often falsely positive if the cat received a panleukopenia vaccine five to 12 days prior to testing.

Virus isolation (a test to find the virus in different tissue samples), antibody levels and PCR testing are also available to help confirm suspicions of feline panleukopenia.

Treatment of Feline Distemper in Cats
There is no specific treatment for feline distemper in cats.

Dehydration is treated with intensive intravenous fluid (IV) therapy while symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea are treated with prescription medications.

Antibiotic therapy is often instituted to help control any secondary bacterial infections due to low white blood cell counts.

However, antibiotics are not used to treat and clear the actual virus. For kittens and cats who appear in shock—or have severe infections—aggressive therapy is started to help treat the symptoms.

This usually includes IV fluids and plasma/blood transfusions to keep them hydrated and restore any blood loss or blood pressure abnormalities. If your cat has any abnormalities in their ability to clot their blood, anticoagulant therapies are used (ex: Plavix). Monitoring and treating cats with electrolyte issues from their symptoms is also needed to ensure survival. Nursing care to ensure they stay warm and fed properly is also very important. Keeping these infected cats isolated from others is key to ensure the virus does not spread.

Cats with feline distemper who receive and respond well to aggressive therapy typically have a good prognosis for a full recovery.

Kittens infected in utero during the early to middle stages of pregnancy usually don’t survive. However, kittens infected in the later stages of pregnancy tend to develop cerebellar hypoplasia but can live happy lives with normal survival times, depending on the severity of the neurological signs.   

Cats with the following have a poor prognosis and, on average, will pass away within 12 to 24 hours.


	
	Low protein levels
	
	
	Low temperatures
	
	
	Thin body conditions
	
	
	Severely low white blood cells on blood work
	


If a cat recovers from feline distemper, there’s usually no permanent damage to their organs, and they develop lifelong immunity to the virus. 

Recovery and Management of Feline Distemper
Since feline panleukopenia is hardy and can remain in the affected environment for a long time, all cages, food/water bowls, toys and bedding should be replaced or thoroughly disinfected.

This virus can live on the hands and clothing of humans who encounter it, so washing your hands with soap and water after handling an infected cat minimizes transmission to other cats.

To ensure safety, unvaccinated cats should not be placed in an environment frequented by a cat with suspected feline distemper.

Probiotics can help maintain proper digestive health while recovering from distemper. Immune boosting supplements are great as well. Intestinal parasites are commonly found in cats with panleukopenia—especially if they came from a shelter. Treating affected cats with deworming medications is necessary during their recovery.

Once your cat comes home to recover from distemper, they need to take all medications exactly as prescribed by their veterinarian until finished.  Your cat should return to the vet for frequent checkups to ensure they remain healthy. If your cat has any new symptoms or they start to not feel well again, take them back to the vet immediately.

Prevention of Feline Distemper
Prevention of feline distemper begins with the feline distemper vaccine, which is part of the core vaccine series for cats. 

Most vaccine protocols recommend at least two doses are given two to four weeks apart, with the last vaccination received when the cat is 14 to 16 weeks old. This vaccination is usually repeated every one to three years, depending on your cat’s lifestyle and the protocols set by your veterinarian.

Discuss vaccination with your veterinarian for more details and recommendations.
Feline Distemper in Cats FAQsWhat are the long-term effects of feline panleukopenia?If the cat receives aggressive care through the early stages of this virus, the prognosis for a full recovery is good. There are often no long term effects in older cats but kittens that have developed neurologic symptoms from brain damage (cerebellar hypoplasia), might have lasting effects on their coordination.
How often do cats need distemper shots?Distemper vaccines are given to kittens starting as early as 6 weeks old (usually given between 6 to 9 weeks old). This vaccine is then boostered every three to four weeks until they are 16 weeks old.

Most veterinarians given kittens a total of three FVRCP vaccines to avoid over-vaccination. Older cats then have a FVRCP booster every one to three years, depending on which vaccine your vet carries.
Do indoor cats need distemper shots?Yes!  All cats need a distemper vaccine as kittens and then to have it boostered annually thereafter.

This core vaccine prevents your cat from developing this potentially deadly disease.

Core vaccines are required for every cat because of the widespread and seriousness of these diseases.

463,Fecal Incontinence in Cats,"What Is Fecal Incontinence in Cats?
Our cat family members learn to use the litter box at an early age. It’s intuitive. Usually, they prefer to dig and bury their business, which suits indoor life well, yet it can be frustrating for pet parents when bowel movements are found outside the litter box. Fecal incontinence is a condition that occurs when a cat is no longer able to control when they defecate.

Fecal incontinence is a loss of bowel control. With any normal stool there are three phases: the storage phase, the awareness of the need to defecate, and then the defecation phase. Most problems with fecal continence occur either because there is an issue with the rectum preventing stool from being stored normally, or with the anal sphincter itself, allowing feces to leak out.

Fecal incontinence is uncommon in both dogs and cats, but it occurs more frequently in senior pets as they age and lose control of their bodily functions; they may not be aware of the need to defecate or do not have the sphincter tone (sphincter able to stay tightly closed) needed to prevent stools from dropping.

Symptoms of Fecal Incontinence in Cats

	
	Bowel movements outside the litter box
	
	
	Stool dropping without awareness
	
	
	Soft stool or diarrhea
	
	
	Stool staining around the rectum
	
	
	Stool leakage

	Changes in how the tail is carried
	
	
	Weakness in the hind end
	
	
	Standing near the litter box to defecate, but they couldn’t “make it in time”
	


Causes of Fecal Incontinence in Cats
Fecal incontinence can be caused by a variety of conditions.

Diarrhea can lead to incontinence, as the bowel movements come on so fast that a cat is unable to make it to the litter box in time. This is commonly seen in cats with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). Certain cancers, like gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma, can look like IBD and also lead to diarrhea and loss of bowel control.

Wounds, trauma, or tumors that affect the anal sphincter can also lead to a loss of bowel control. This is seen occasionally in cats with a ruptured anal gland, laceration, or abscess (a tear or open wound) near their anus. Sometimes it is observed following perianal surgery, like a perineal hernia repair or anal sac removal. Cancer of the rectum and surrounding region can also lead to sphincter or nerves involved in normal defecation.

Prolonged constipation or straining to defecate can also lead to fecal incontinence, as nerve damage can occur. Cats that are chronically constipated or those that develop megacolon (an abnormal expansion of the colon) can struggle to control their bowel movements.

Intervertebral disc disease and lumbosacral stenosis are both conditions that lead to compression of the spinal cord. While they are more common causes of fecal incontinence in dogs, cats can also experience loss of control of their bowel movements because of spinal cord damage and disruption of the nerves needed for bowel control.

Some cats are born without a fully developed spinal cord and with poor control of their bowel movements. This is more common in tailless Manx cats due to a recessive gene that can lead to poor development of the nerves that control bowel movements.

A loss of bowel control can also occur with age, as the anal sphincter muscles become thinner and it can be difficult for a cat to keep stool from falling out. Some senior cats also develop cognitive dysfunction, or dementia. This can affect their awareness of the need to defecate or make them forget where the litter box is in their home.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Fecal Incontinence in Cats
A diagnosis of fecal incontinence starts with a thorough history of your cat’s health. Your veterinarian will want to know how often your cat is having bowel movements outside the litter box, if the bowel movements are solid, soft, or diarrhea, and if you have witnessed any stool falling out of the rectum without your cat noticing. Try to bring a fresh stool sample to your cat’s appointment.

Next, a complete physical exam will be done. Your vet will examine your cat’s anus closely to look for any abnormalities of the sphincter and surrounding area. They will likely do a rectal exam, palpate (examine by feeling) your cat’s abdomen, and perform a neurological exam to ensure all the nerves that travel to their back end are functioning properly.

A fecal exam of your cat’s stool, X-rays, and blood work may be recommended depending upon what is found on the physical exam. If IBD or GI lymphoma are suspected, they may recommend additional special blood work, an abdominal ultrasound, or intestinal biopsies. If spinal disease is suspected, a CT scan or MRI may be recommended.
Treatment of Fecal Incontinence in Cats
Treatment depends upon the underlying cause of the loss of bowel control. Your veterinarian will guide you on treatment options available after an underlying cause is identified.

If your cat is diagnosed with IBD, GI lymphoma, or another condition that is affecting their ability to store feces, they will likely be put on long-term oral medications. If another cause of diarrhea is identified, it will be treated accordingly. But if chronic constipation is leading to fecal incontinence, your cat may be put on stool softeners and prescribed medications, and placed on a special long-term diet such as Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal Fiber Response Food or Hill®’s Prescription Diet Gastrointestinal Biome.

Spinal cord and nerve issues may respond to medical management or surgery, but the condition might be so advanced that no treatment is possible. Some conditions, like tumors, may lead to surgery recommendations, while post-operative incontinence complications may resolve with time or be untreatable.

Fecal incontinence related to age and sphincter issues is rarely something that can be treated—only managed. But some cats can benefit from a low-fiber diet to decrease the frequency of their bowel movements. 

Recovery and Management of Fecal Incontinence in Cats
While some underlying causes of fecal incontinence can be cured, others can only be managed. Some cannot be treated at all.

If your cat is experiencing a loss of control of their bowel movements, it may be helpful for you to keep them confined to a smaller region of the home that is easy to clean. House soiling can be frustrating for pet parents, but minimizing the cleanup to a smaller space can help. Be sure to keep your cat’s bedding clean and dry.

It is also important that you keep your cat clean. With stool dropping or diarrhea, there may be some feces left behind on the surrounding skin and fur. Be sure to keep your cat’s hind end clean so that they don’t develop secondary infections. Daily grooming wipes are helpful for quick cleanups on a cat.

Some pet parents find cat diapers helpful, but sanitary concerns and routine bathing and drying of the backside are very important to avoid secondary urinary tract infections and skin infections. Keeping your cat’s back end shaved regularly may also be helpful for easier cleaning.
Fecal Incontinence in Cats FAQsCan bowel incontinence in cats be cured?In some cases, bowel incontinence can resolve if the underlying cause can be treated or managed. In other cases, it may not be curable.
What causes a cat to lose control of their bowel movements?Cats can lose control of their bowel movements for a variety of reasons. There is either an issue with storage of feces or with the sphincter itself.

464,Fatty Tissue Inflammation in Cats,"Steatitis in Cats
 
Steatitis is a rare disease in cats, characterized by a lump under the skin surface due to inflammation of the fatty tissue. Nutrition is often involved in the pathology of this condition. Ingestion of large amounts of unsaturated fats without sufficient antioxidant activity may result in peroxidation (where free radicals ""steal"" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage) with subsequent fat necrosis (death of fat cells) and steatitis. Cats that are fed large amounts of tuna, particularly red tuna, tend to be more prone to steatitis.
 
Steatitis in cats can also occur secondary to infection, inflammatory disorders, vasculopathy (disease of the blood vessels), cancer, injury, and immune-mediated disease. Some cases are idiopathic (cause is unknown). This disorder has become less prevalent in cats as more cats are fed commercially prepared diets that have added antioxidants. Steatitis can be found in any part of the body. It may be mistaken for a tumor, making it important to have the lump examined and biopsied as soon as possible. 
 
Steatitis is more likely to be found in young to middle-aged cats, from four months to seven years.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Lump in the subcutaneous tissue (fatty tissue)
    Decreased appetite
    Lethargy
    Reluctance to move, jump, play
    Pain with handling or with abdominal palpation
    Fever

 
Causes
 

    Vitamin E deficiency
    Decreased antioxidant capacity with subsequent free-radical peroxidation of lipids
    Oily fish-based diet (red tuna, whitefish, sardines, mackerel, herring, cod); rarely, liver-based diet
    Homemade diet with large fish base or pig's brain
    Large amounts of dietary unsaturated fatty acids
    Pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer
    Infection (viral, fungal, bacterial)
    Immune-mediated, cancer
    Trauma, pressure, cold, foreign material
    Radiation therapy
    Idiopathic (unknown cause)

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what underlying conditions are causing the outward symptoms.
 
To determine the exact cause of your cat's symptoms, your veterinarian will start with a physical examination of the affected area. A full physical workup will include a blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. To determine the full makeup of the inflamed mass of tissue, your veterinarian will also need to do a fine-needle aspiration, taking a sample of the tissue and fluid in order to conduct a cell examination and a fungal/bacterial culture.


 
Treatment 

 
This is a painful condition, so attention will be given to your cat's comfort level and steps will be taken to encourage the appetite. Concurrent disorders will also be treated.
 
Dietary changes are typically recommended. Your cat may require tube feeding for a while until its condition has sufficiently improved. Your doctor may also prescribe Vitamin E and possibly corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Temporarily removing all fish products from the diet and focusing on a nutritionally complete, balanced, commercially-prepared food diet is one of the first steps. Surgical treatment may involve draining the lump, or full removal of the lump. Antibiotics will be prescribed if the lump is found to be infected, or to prevent infection after treatment.
 
To avoid further complications that can result from licking and biting at a healing wound, your veterinarian may advise you to keep an Elizabethan collar on your cat until the wound has fully healed.
 
Prevention
 
Feed a commercial diet that is balanced to meet all of your cat's dietary needs.

Living and Management
 
It may require weeks to months for resolution of this condition, but the prognosis is good once the primary cause of the steatitis has been treated and an appropriate diet is established."," and Types

465,Fatty Layer or Nodule Under the Skin in Cats,"Panniculitis in Cats

Panniculitis is a condition where the layer of fat just under the cat's skin (subcutaneous fat tissue) becomes inflamed. Though uncommon, the fatty tissue typically concentrates and affects the trunk area as a single nodule or as multiple nodules. In addition, as a result of secondary infections and other complications, the fat cells within the nodule(s) may die.

Cats of any age, sex, or breed may be affected by panniculitis.

Symptoms and Types

Most cats have a single nodular lesion on the trunk that vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The nodule, which is either firm or soft, is freely movable underneath the skin until fully grown. In some cases, yellow-brown to bloody discharge is excreted from the nodule, while the outer skin may turn red, brown, or yellow in color. The area may be extremely sensitive, especially immediately after rupturing. After the ulcers heal, a scar or crusty layer of skin may form.

Causes

Panniculitis may be caused by several factors, including:


    Trauma
    Infections (bacterial, fungal, etc.)
    Immune-mediated diseases (lupus panniculitis, erythema nodosum)
    Recent subcutaneous injections (corticosteroids, vaccines)
    Neoplastic diseases (multicentric mast cell tumors, cutaneous lymphosarcoma)


Diagnosis

You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile. However, other than the presence of a mass or nodule beneath the skin, most cats will not demonstrate other complications.



Depending on the underlying cause, other diagnostic procedures may be used to rule our other diseases/conditions. For example, the number of white blood cells on a CBC (complete blood count) typically rises in case of infection and help veterinarian determine the type, duration, and severity of infection. Your veterinarian will also usually take a sample directly from the nodule and send it to a pathologist for culture and sensitivity, which helps in determining the type of causative organism (bacteria, fungi) and the suitable course of treatment.

Treatment

Often, the preferred method of treatment is surgery, especially if only a single nodule is present. However, in case of multiple nodules, a combination of surgery and medication works well. For example, if fungal or bacterial infections are involved, antifungal and  antibacterial medications will be administered, respectively.

If no organism has found to be the cause of the panniculitis -- also called a sterile nodule -- your veterinarian will prescribe steroids, to aid in the regression of the nodule. Vitamin E can also be given in mild cases.

Living and Management

Overall prognosis for cats with panniculitis is often good after treatment. In some cases, it takes just three to six weeks for the nodule(s) to completely regress. Your veterinarian will ask that you bring in the cat for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will conduct routine laboratory tests to monitor the progress of the treatment. This is especially true if steroids are being used to regress the nodule(s)."," and Types

466,False Pregnancy in Cats,"What Is False Pregnancy in Cats?
Although common in dogs, false pregnancy is an uncommon condition in cats. Only females who have not had their reproductive organs removed during a spay surgery (ovariohysterectomy) can experience false pregnancy, which occurs during a specific time in their reproductive cycle.

To understand false pregnancy, one needs to know a bit about basic cat reproduction. Cats are seasonally polyestrous, which means they come into heat—the time when they are receptive to breeding—only during seasons with long daylight hours.

They repeatedly cycle every two to three weeks during this time, unless a pregnancy or false pregnancy interrupts the process. In North America, cats breed in spring, summer, and fall.

Cats are induced ovulators, which means they do not produce eggs automatically. A female cat’s ovaries release an egg only if she breeds with a male. If the egg is successfully fertilized, she becomes pregnant.

If not, a cat can experience a false pregnancy (pseudopregnancy). Hormonal changes during false pregnancy can make a cat appear and behave as though she were pregnant, even though she isn’t.

In most cases, a false pregnancy resolves without treatment. This condition is not an emergency, but you should speak with your veterinarian if you suspect your cat is experiencing either a pregnancy or a false pregnancy. Your vet will rule out a true pregnancy or other medical problem that could be causing your cat’s symptoms.

Symptoms of False Pregnancy in Cats 
Cats rarely show signs of a false pregnancy. However, breeding cats frequently experience false pregnancies, which are considered normal in the breeding process.

Because most female pet cats in North America are spayed at a young age, a typical indoor cat is unlikely to experience a false pregnancy. Barn or community cats are the most likely to experience this condition. If you let your unspayed female cat go outdoors, she is at risk of becoming pregnant.

When a false pregnancy occurs, a cat’s symptoms mimic those of a true pregnancy. False pregnancy symptoms in cats include:


	
	Weight gain
	
	
	Distended abdomen
	
	
	Licking the abdomen
	
	
	Mammary development
	
	
	Milk production
	
	
	Nesting behavior
	


Causes of False Pregnancy in Cats 
Cats can experience false pregnancy if they breed with a male and do not become pregnant. Changes in a female cat’s progesterone and prolactin levels—hormones associated with reproduction and pregnancy—play a role.

Also, some female cats may spontaneously ovulate, which can cause a false pregnancy even if they have not been around a male cat.

Only unspayed female cats can experience false pregnancy, but the condition can also theoretically occur a few days after spay surgery. This phenomenon is likely related to the sudden decrease in hormone levels after a veterinarian has removed a female cat’s reproductive organs.

How Veterinarians Diagnose False Pregnancy in Cats 
To diagnose a false pregnancy, your veterinarian will ask you to provide your cat’s thorough medical history and to describe your female cat’s lifestyle, recent behavior, and contact with male cats.

Because pregnancy and false pregnancy may cause similar symptoms, your veterinarian will rule out a true pregnancy. Your vet may also want to exclude other reproductive conditions, such as a uterine infection (pyometra).

To determine the cause of your cat’s pregnancy symptoms, your veterinary team may perform one or more of the following tests:


	
	Complete physical exam
	
	
	Basic blood work
	
	
	Blood hormone levels
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound
	
	
	Abdominal X-rays
	


Treatment of False Pregnancy in Cats 
False pregnancy in cats usually resolves without treatment. A vet won’t typically prescribe medications that alter hormone levels. This is because these drugs cause significant side effects, and false pregnancy isn’t usually harmful to the cat.

False pregnancy does not affect a cat’s fertility. If your cat experiences a false pregnancy, they can become pregnant or develop additional false pregnancies in the future. If you don’t want your cat to have kittens, having them spayed will prevent pregnancies.

Recovery and Management of False Pregnancy in Cats 
Most false pregnancies last 40 to 50 days, until the cat begins a new estrus cycle. However, if your cat is showing signs of a false pregnancy, the signs will likely resolve within a few weeks.

If your cat experiences a false pregnancy, you can support their recovery by keeping them indoors, providing comfortable bedding, monitoring their appetite, and discouraging them from licking their belly.

A recovery collar or postsurgical onesie can help prevent licking. Avoid touching your cat’s mammary glands or letting her lick them, which can stimulate milk production.

Prevention of False Pregnancy in Cats
The best way to prevent your cat from having a false pregnancy is to have her spayed before her first heat cycle.

Most veterinarians recommend that cats undergo a spay procedure at around 5 to 6 months of age, although spaying later in life still provides benefits. A spay surgery prevents pregnancy and false pregnancy and also reduces your female cat’s risk for various cancers.
False Pregnancy in Cats FAQsCan a spayed cat have a false pregnancy? Only reproductively intact cats can develop a false pregnancy. If a female cat undergoes a spay procedure during a specific time in her reproductive cycle, she could develop a false pregnancy a few days later. After a spay procedure, false pregnancy is no longer possible.
Why does my cat appear to be pregnant even though she isn’t?Cats may seem to be pregnant during a false pregnancy, but other conditions can also lead to symptoms such as weight gain, abdominal distention, or mammary gland enlargement.

Obesity, tumors, infections, and organ failure are potential causes. Speak with your vet if you notice any changes in your cat’s appearance.
What is the mammary gland discharge in a cat with a false pregnancy? A false pregnancy elevates a cat’s prolactin level, which stimulates milk production. Your cat’s mammary glands may leak milky or watery secretions for several weeks, but symptoms usually resolve on their own.

To avoid further stimulating the production of milk, do not “milk” your cat or allow her to lick her mammary area.

Fainting is known as syncope, a condition that causes physical impairment in addition to a loss of consciousness. Cats can sometimes temporarily pass out due a decrease in blood flow to the brain, caused by a lack of oxygen and nutrients.

Depending on the cause, the cat can recover within seconds to minutes. Fainting is slightly more common in older cats than in younger ones. It may be seen more in certain breeds such as the Ragdoll, due to that breed’s predisposition for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy—a thickening of the left ventricle of the heart.

Unlike in humans, fainting in cats is relatively uncommon because a cat’s head is a shorter distance above their heart when standing. A human’s head is a longer distance above the heart, which means the heart must work harder to pump blood to our brains.

What if Your Cat Passes Out?

Any time a cat passes out—but especially the first time it happens—contact your veterinarian or animal hospital immediately.

Often, when a cat faints it is due to something harmless like stress or excitement, but other times it can be related to an underlying condition, such as low blood sugar, heart dysfunction, or ingestion of a toxic substance. In these cases, prompt medical attention is required to ensure the issue does not become life-threatening.

While fainting episodes can be distressing, it’s important to note the following (if you can) to provide to a veterinarian:


	
	What the cat was doing immediately before and after the fainting episode
	
	
	When the fainting episode occurred and how long it lasted
	
	
	If possible, make a video of the fainting episode, which may provide additional information
	


On the way to the veterinary clinic, try to keep your cat calm and relaxed, as stress and excitement can trigger further fainting episodes. A covered carrier with dim lighting,  along with Feliway® pheromone spray applied to the carrier, may encourage calmness. If your cat is prone to stress, anxiety, or fear aggression associated with veterinary visits, it may be beneficial to consult with your veterinarian about prescription medications to be given before transport.

Symptoms of Fainting in Cats

	
	Falling to the ground suddenly, usually on their side
	
	
	Involuntary muscle twitching
	
	
	Loss of bladder or bowel control
	
	
	Limp, floppy body
	
	
	Pale tongue and/or gums
	
	
	Lack of response to voice or touch, signaling loss of consciousness
	


Causes of Fainting in Cats
One of the most common causes of fainting in cats (as well as in dogs) is heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure, heart valve disorders, congenital heart defects, or heart tumors that may interfere with the heart’s function. Heart disease may compromise the ability of the heart to deliver blood to the brain, causing fainting.

Fainting can also occur due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) from conditions such as:


	
	Liver disease
	
	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Endocrine disorder
	
	
	Excess insulin given during diabetes management
	
	
	Insulinoma (an insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas)
	
	
	Severe infections leading to sepsis
	


Kidney disease and diabetes, when uncontrolled, can also lead to electrolyte imbalances resulting in hypocalcemia (low calcium in the blood) or hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood). Both conditions can cause fainting.

Diseases that lead to thickening of the blood, such as bone marrow disorders, or anything that causes low blood pressure in cats can also lead to fainting, including:


	
	Anemia
	
	
	Blood loss from wounds or trauma
	
	
	Hypothermia (low body temperature)
	
	
	Overdose of medications for high blood pressure, such as amlodipine, or diuretic medications such as furosemide
	
	
	Lung diseases such as pneumonia and pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) can compromise oxygen delivery to the brain and cause fainting.
	
	
	Degenerative myelopathy, a spinal cord disorder that interrupts signals to the brain, can result in fainting episodes.
	
	
	Ingestion of toxic substances such as lilies, chocolate, and onions can cause various kinds of internal organ failure that can lead to fainting.
	


Less concerning causes of fainting in cats can include:


	
	Straining to urinate or defecate
	
	
	Pushing with the abdomen when coughing
	
	
	Swallowing too forcefully
	
	
	Pulling on a cat’s collar with any amount of pressure
	


Any of these actions can compromise the pumping of a sufficient amount of blood to the brain, which increases the likelihood of fainting.

Stress or excitement can also cause cats to pass out if the vagus nerve—the part of a cat’s nervous system that controls heart rate and blood pressure—overreacts to a stimulus or external trigger. If blood pressure or heart rate fall too much, blood flow to the brain will decrease, resulting in fainting.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Fainting in Cats
When a cat has fainted, the veterinarian will perform diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause. They start by asking the pet parent for a detailed history relating to both the fainting incident(s) and any past medical issues. The veterinarian will then perform a thorough nose-to-tail physical examination, looking for:


	
	Elevated heart rate or heart murmurs that may signal heart problems
	
	
	Fluid in the lungs or lung crackles that may indicate pneumonia
	
	
	Changes in the pupils that may signal toxin ingestion or high blood pressure
	
	
	Changes in gum color that may indicate anemia
	
	
	Decreases in body temperature
	
	
	Signs of blood loss such as wounds or trauma that might explain any fainting episodes
	


Following the physical exam, the veterinarian will decide which diagnostics tests may be most helpful for determining the cause of fainting. These usually include a CBC (complete blood count) and chemistry panel, which measures minerals and compounds in the blood.

Based on the test results and the physical exam findings, the veterinarian may recommend further diagnostics, such as:


	
	An ECG (electrocardiogram) or heart monitor for cats suspected of having heart conditions
	
	
	Ultrasound, x-ray, or CT for cats suspected of having liver, lung, kidney, or brain issues or who may have tumors causing abnormal chemistry values
	
	
	CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) analysis may also be used to evaluate cats for diseases like degenerative myelopathy
	


Treatment of Fainting in Cats
Determining the underlying causes of syncope in cats can help veterinarians begin the most effective treatment:


	
	For heart conditions, treatment may involve medications to regulate heart rhythm and blood pressure and manage heart failure. In some cases, cats may require surgery to implant a pacemaker to ensure proper heart function.
	
	
	If low blood sugar, low calcium, or low sodium is the cause, the veterinarian will administer fluids to correct the immediate issue and begin treatment to address the underlying cause, such as correcting insulin administration for diabetes, antibiotics and supportive care for sepsis, or a prescription kidney diet and phosphorus binders for kidney disease.
	
	
	If blood clots are the issue, the veterinarian may prescribe blood thinners or anti-clotting medications. Anemia and blood loss from wounds and trauma may require a blood transfusion. Wounds and trauma may also require surgery to repair torn skin and blood vessels.
	
	
	Fainting caused by medications may require the veterinarian to adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication without fainting as a side effect.
	
	
	For lung diseases, steroids and diuretics may be used to decrease inflammation, reduce coughing, and remove excess fluid from around the lungs.
	
	
	Ingestion of toxins may require decontamination procedures such as activated charcoal administration, fluids, or inducing vomiting.
	


If fainting is related to stress, anxiety, or excitement, treatment will center around keeping the cat calm with a variety of management techniques such as Feliway pheromone diffusers, enrichment, gentle handling, anti-anxiety medications like gabapentin or fluoxetine, and supplements such as Purina Pro Plan Calming Care probiotic and Zylkene.

If the cat is vomiting and straining to defecate due to constipation, stool softeners, a high-fiber diet, probiotics, anti-nausea medications (often Cerenia), and increasing water intake can be helpful for managing fainting episodes. Fainting due to hypothermia may be eased by administering warmed IV fluids and using external warming tools such as hot water bottles.

Recovery and Management of Fainting in Cats
The timeline for recovery depends on the underlying cause of the fainting episode. For underlying issues such as heart conditions and diabetes, lifelong management is required.

Episodes caused by stress and excitement may not require any at-home management if the cat rarely encounters stressful situations, or they may require lifelong administration of medications if the cat has underlying anxiety or aggression issues.

After your trip to the veterinarian and a fainting and a treatment plan is in place, your cat may be able to go home the same day or may be hospitalized for treatment. At-home care in either case will depend upon the cause.

The veterinarian will likely schedule at least one follow-up visit, so it is important to maintain your cat on any prescribed medications and follow discharge instructions from the veterinarian. Keep track of progress at home, any new episodes, and any medication side effects to report back to the veterinarian at the follow-up visits.

Contact the veterinarian immediately if your cat faints again.

If there has been any gastrointestinal upset, keeping your cat on a bland diet of plain boiled chicken and white rice may be helpful for the first two or three days. Activity restriction to decrease the risk of fainting again from overexertion may also be advised.

One fainting episode does not always mean that a cat will be more susceptible to future fainting episodes; the diagnosis will affect the likelihood of it happening again.

Prevention of Fainting in Cats

The prevention of fainting in cats depends upon many factors: strict adherence to treatment protocols, keeping the cat away from toxic substances, and working closely with your veterinarian to adjust medication dosage and timing are all important.

Your veterinarian may also advise you to switch medications if adverse reactions develop, manage behavioral causes of fainting by reducing stress and excitement, and return for regular wellness examinations.

Fainting related to heart disease generally carries a poor prognosis; in other cases, if the cause of fainting is identified and addressed quickly, the prognosis is often good.

468,Fading Kitten Syndrome,"What Is Fading Kitten Syndrome?
Caring for a newborn kitten can be a rewarding experience—but it also can be heartbreaking if they experience fading kitten syndrome. 

Fading kitten syndrome refers to a kitten’s failure to thrive during the period between birth and when they wean from their mother or a bottle. This period lasts about four to five weeks, when a kitten is most vulnerable to sickness.

Fading kitten syndrome is typically fatal, but recognizing the symptoms can help you to understand when to get veterinary help.

Symptoms of Fading Kitten Syndrome
Kittens that fail to meet normal development milestones may be experiencing fading kitten syndrome. Some of these milestones include:


	
	Ability to turn over from their back by day three of birth
	
	
	Ability to support themselves on their feet by 2 weeks of age
	


Other symptoms of fading kitten syndrome include:


	
	Constant noises that indicate distress (such as whining or crying), even after feeding
	
	
	Gradually worsening lethargy
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	
	
	Poor suckling reflex
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Inability to gain weight
	
	
	Labored breathing
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Nasal or eye discharge
	


Causes of Fading Kitten Syndrome
Fading kitten syndrome can have several causes. Some include:


	
	Trouble during birthing
	
	
	Lack of maternal antibodies (cells that help protect kitten’s immature immune system)
	
	
	Bacterial or viral infections
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Malformations present at birth (e.g., heart defects, gastrointestinal defects, brain defects, lung defects)
	
	
	Low birth weight
	
	
	Trauma
	
	
	Maternal neglect
	
	
	Malnutrition
	


Genetics can also play a role in fading kitten syndrome.

If a mother cat has a blood type that differs from her kitten, her maternal antibodies may attack the kitten’s red blood cells, causing anemia that can lead to fading kitten syndrome. This condition is called neonatal isoerythrolysis.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Fading Kitten Syndrome
To diagnose fading kitten syndrome, your veterinarian will examine your newborn kitten in the first few weeks of life. Your vet will check them routinely every few weeks until the kitten is weaned to determine if they are thriving.

If your vet doesn’t think your kitten is reaching their milestones—such as not suckling correctly (or at all), or not gaining weight—they will recommend diagnostic testing. This testing will help your vet figure out if there is a specific diagnosis for why the kitten is not thriving and is declining in health.

Diagnostic testing typically involves blood work, fecal and urine testing, and imaging (X-rays and/or an ultrasound).

Unfortunately, sometimes a diagnosis can’t be made before a kitten passes away or is humanely euthanized due to poor prognosis or poor quality of life.

If you have other cats or kittens at home, your veterinarian might recommend that a necropsy (autopsy) be done. This is to ensure that your other cats are not at risk of developing a contagious disease.

Treatment of Fading Kitten Syndrome
Fading kitten syndrome may be treatable if an underlying cause can be identified in time— but this is typically not the case.

For example, some bacterial infections can be treated if caught early enough, while some congenital (condition present at birth) defects may not, especially if the kitten’s quality of life would be poor. 

Treatment includes supportive care while the veterinarian works to identify an underling cause. Supportive care usually includes:


	
	Fluids can be given intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (under the skin) to keep the kitten hydrated and help regulate other body functions, like correcting low blood pressure.
	
	
	Dextrose is a sugar solution that is given to kittens to support blood sugar levels. Young kittens still have developing body systems, and they often can’t regulate their own blood sugar, or they have low blood sugar from not eating. Adding this sugar solution to your kittens' fluids or given by mouth is helpful to aid their survival.
	
	
	Antimicrobials such as antibiotics, antifungal, or antiviral medications are given to combat specific organisms such as bacteria, yeast, and some viruses. These medications can be given by mouth but if you kitten is not eating well, most can be given by injection instead.
	
	
	Nutritional support is provided to your kitten when they are not eating well on their own. Typically, a feeding tube will have to be placed either in your kitten's nose or directly into the stomach to provide them with the calories, vitamins, and minerals they need to hopefully recover from their illness. Cats are unique in that if they do not eat enough calories per day, their body will go into hepatic lipidosis or liver failure, which can be fatal regardless of the underlying cause of the kitten's illness.
	
	
	Oxygen support is provided to kittens either by placing a nasal canula directly in the nose or by putting them in a special oxygen cage. Oxygen helps kittens that are having trouble breathing.
	
	
	Body temperature support is provided to ensure your tiny kitten can stay warm. Young kittens can’t regulate their body temperature effectively, which can result in a temperature too high (hyperthermia) or too low (hypothermia). Heat support can be provided with a heating blanket, or warmed bottles placed around the kitten. Cold compresses can be used along with ice on the paw pads to help a high temperature come down.
	


A delay in evaluation and treatment could result in:


	
	Low blood sugar
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Low body temperature
	


Unfortunately, even with treatment, some kittens will pass away.

Recovery and Management of Fading Kitten Syndrome
Recovery from fading kitten syndrome is possible if an underlying cause can be identified and treated in time. Unfortunately, fading kitten syndrome is often fatal, with the highest rate of mortality being in the first week of a cat’s life. 

If a kitten does survive this crucial period and grows stronger, long-term management is aimed at proper nutrition, providing sanitary conditions and preventative health care, and close monitoring to ensure they gain weight. 

The long-term outlook for kittens that recover is good, unless there is a congenital or chronic viral infection that affects the kitten’s life expectancy. 

Prevention of Fading Kitten Syndrome
Fading kitten syndrome is not often a preventable condition.

It can potentially be prevented by ensuring that your new kitten’s mother cat (or queen) has adequate prenatal veterinary care.

The queen should be fully vaccinated, have flea and tick prevention and undergo routine deworming.

It’s important to ensure that your new kitten is taken to the vet within three days to determine if they are healthy. If kittens are displaying signs of illness, take them to the vet immediately.

Viruses, bacterial infections, and parasites are often highly contagious. If this is the cause of a kitten’s inability to thrive, it can be spread to other cats and kittens.

Luckily, most viruses are species-specific, meaning your dog is not necessarily at risk of getting sick from your kitten.
How can I tell if a newborn kitten is healthy?The best way to tell if your newborn kitten is healthy is to have them examined by your veterinarian. It’s recommended that all new pets are examined by their veterinarian within three days of birth or adoption.

Your vet will perform a physical exam and test your kitten for infectious diseases with blood and fecal testing. If you notice your new kitten is showing symptoms of illness or behaving in a way that is abnormal, take them to the vet immediately.

469,Face Nerve Paralysis in Dogs,"Facial Nerve Paresis/Paralysis in Dogs



Facial nerve paresis is a dysfunction of the seventh cranial nerve, the facial nerve. This condition is evidenced by paralysis or weakness of the muscles of the ears, eyelids, lips, and nostrils.



The cause of this disease is impairment of the facial nerve, or of the place where the nerves come together, and it affects the electrical impulses of the nerves involved. The facial nerve is affected, and sometimes the ophthalmic system as well, interfering with the function of the tear glands. Dry eye syndrome also accompanies the tear gland interference. Gender does not play a role, but breed appears to in some cases. Adult age Cocker Spaniels, Pembroke Welsh corgis, boxers, and English setters are most likely to experience this condition.



Symptoms and Types




	Messy eating; food left around mouth
	Food falling from the side of the mouth
	Excessive drooling
	Inability to close eye; rubbing; discharge from eye
	Inability to close the eyelids
	Wide separation between the upper and lower eyelids
	Decreased or absent menace response and eyelid reflex
	Facial asymmetry
	Ear and lip drooping
	Collapse of the nostril
	Chronic - patient may have deviation of the face toward the affected side
	Occasional facial spasms may be observed
	Discharge of pus from the affected eye
	Somnolence or stupor




Causes



One sided facial nerve paresis:


	Idiopathic (unknown cause)
	Metabolic - hypothyroid
	Inflammatory - otitis media-interna: inflammation of the inner ear
	Nasopharyngeal polyps: benign growths that can occur in the back of the throat, the middle ear and even perforate through the ear drum – rare in dogs
	Cancer
	Trauma - fracture of a bone at the base of the skull; injury to the facial nerve
	Iatrogenic (physician induced) - secondary to surgical flushing of the external ear canal




Two-sided facial nerve paresis:


	Idiopathic - rare
	Inflammatory and immune mediated - inflammation of nerve roots, including coonhound paralysis; polyneuropathies (multiple nerves are involved); myasthenia gravis (muscle weakness)
	Metabolic - nerves affected by cancer in the body
	Toxic - botulism
	Pituitary neoplasm: abnormal tissue growth – of unknown cause
	Infectious - Lyme disease in humans not proven in dogs at this time




Central Nervous System:


	Most are one-sided
	Inflammatory - infectious and noninfectious
	Neoplastic - primary brain tumor; metastatic tumor








Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition.



Your veterinarian will first determine whether the paresis is one sided or both sided, and will then look for other neurological signs. Unless your dog has had an ear disease, or other neurological deficits, the cause will be determined as unknown. Some of the causes that will be considered will be possible middle or inner ear disease; if your dog is lethargic and has a poor hair coat, a test for hypothyroidism will be done; if your dog is sleeping a lot and is displaying symptoms related to a brainstem disorder, a disease of the central nervous system will be considered.



A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, although these are typically normal in the case of facial paralysis. Even so, there are some disorders that might account for the symptoms, such as an anemia, excessive production of cholesterol, or low blood sugar.



X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to detect the location of the problem. There are also other tests that can be used to evaluate tear production, motor nerve conduction speed, and for the detection of brainstem disease.





Treatment



Treatment will most likely be on an outpatient basis, but your veterinarian may need to hospitalize your dog for the testing procedures. If fiber develops in the muscles, there is a natural tuck up that reduces asymmetry, and drooling usually stops within two to four weeks. But, you will need to be prepared for the possibility of the clinical signs remaining permanently, or returning. In addition, the other side of the face can become affected. The cornea on the affected side may need long term lubrication, and extra care may be needed if your dog is a breed with natural bulging of the eye. You will also need to regularly check for corneal ulcers. Most animals tolerate this nerve deficit well, but if the disorder is in the middle ear, surgery may be necessary for relieving the severity of the discomfort.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will want to reevaluate your dog's condition soon after the initial treatment for evidence of superficial loss of tissue on the surface of the cornea. If there is a corneal ulcer your dog will need to be seen frequently for treatment. After that, your dog will be assessed monthly for reflexes of the eye and eyelids, lip and ear movements, and to evaluate the return of normal function.



Eye care: the cornea on the affected side may need frequent lubrication or application of artificial tears. Most animals tolerate this nerve deficit well."," and Types

471,Eyelash Disorders in Cats,"Trichiasis, Distichiasis, and Ectopic Cilia in Cats

Trichiasis, distichiasis, and ectopic cilia are eyelash disorders that are rarely found in cats. Trichiasis is in-growth of the eyelashes; distichiasis is an eyelash that grows from an abnormal spot on the eyelid; and ectopic cilia are single or multiple hairs that grow through the inside of the eyelid. In all of these conditions, the eyelash hair can come into contact with and damage the cornea or conjunctiva of the eye.

Symptoms and Types

Trichiasis

    Change in pigmentation of the 		iris (colored portion of the eye)
    Abnormal ticking or twitching of 		the eyelid (blepharospasm)
    Overflow of tears (epiphora)
    Swelling of eyes


Distichiasis

    Mostly no symptoms can be seen
    Stiff cilia (eyelash)
    Pawing at eye
    Abnormal tick or twitch of eyelid 		(blepharospasm)
    Overflow of tears (epiphora)
    Increased blood vessels in the 		cornea
    Change in iris pigmentation
    Corneal ulcers


Ectopic cilia

    Eye pain
    Severe abnormal ticking or 		twitching of the eyelid (blepharospasm)
    Overflow of tears (epiphora)


Causes


    Facial conformation and breed 	predisposition
    Unknown etiology in many cats


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will carefully inspect the eye structures and eyelashes to discern exactly which eyelash disorder your cat has. The diagnosis is usually straightforward in most cases. Your veterinarian will perform a Schirmer tear test to measure tear production and evaluate whether the affected eye is producing enough tears to keep it moist, and a fluorescein stain over the surface of the eye to make corneal ulcers visible.  Determination of intraocular (within the eye) pressure is also an important test in evaluating the eye. This test will allow your veterinarian to evaluate the level of fluid pressure inside the eye. More specific testing may be performed to evaluate both the superficial and deep structures of eye.
  
Treatment

Eliminating the eye irritation will resolve symptoms in most cases. In case of trichiasis, in some patients the hair will be cut short to prevent eye irritation. In others patients surgery may be required for correction of the defect.

In distichiasis no treatment is usually required. Hairs that have been mechanically plucked will regrow within four to five weeks, and will need to removed again. In some cases of distichiasis, surgery may be required. For example, in cases where the hair is a frequent irritation to the surface of the eye.

In case of ectopic cilia, surgery is the preferred method for removing the ectopic eyelash hairs.

Living and Management

Observe your cat's eyes and consult your veterinarian if you notice any recurrence of symptoms. Keep the eyes clean, either with fresh water, or with a veterinarian recommended eye wash. In cases of distichiasis, re-growth is common, in which case you may need to revisit your veterinarian for follow-up care."," and Types

472,Eye Injuries in Cats,"Corneal and Scleral Lacerations in Cats 



In medical terms, a penetrating injury is a wound, or a foreign object that enters the eye but does not completely pass through the cornea or sclera. A perforating injury, on the other hand, is a wound or foreign body that completely passes through the cornea or the sclera. Needless to say, the latter injury is a greater risk to vision. The cornea is the transparent outer layer at the front (anterior) of the eye. The sclera, the white of the eye, is composed of a tough covering that protects the eyeball.



Again in medical terms, a simple injury involves only the cornea or sclera and may be penetrating or perforating. Other eye structures are not injured in a simple injury. A complicated injury perforates the eye and involves other eye structures in addition to the cornea or sclera. In fact, it can affect one or all parts of the eye. The entire middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels, and which is composed of the iris, the area between the iris, and the choroid - - the layer between the sclera and the retina - - can be injured by a complicated perforating injury. There may also be trauma to the lens, which can lead to cataracts or lacerations to the eyelid.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of an injury to the eyeball may be represented by the suddenness of the symptoms (e.g., pawing at the eye, blinking rapidly, swelling, inflammation), as well as the following symptoms, any of which may be indicative of an injury to the eye:




	Blood in the eye, or a blood filled mass (subconjunctival hematoma) left from a sealed laceration
	A foreign object in the eye that can be visually detected
	The pupil is distorted, either reacting abnormally or shaped differently
	The cornea, is clouded (cataract)
	The eye is protruding




Causes



Some of the most common occurrences that lead to an eye injury follow: 




	When your pet has been running through heavy vegetation
	Gunshot, fireworks, or other rapid projectiles in the vicinity of your pet
	Pre-existing visual impairment or deformity in the structure of the eye
	Young, naive, or highly excitable animals that have not learned caution
	Fights with other animals; most notably cats, which will scratch at the faces of other animals




Diagnosis



If your veterinarian finds a foreign object in your cat's eye, appropriate treatment will be determined. The nature, force, and direction of the object's impact will help to identify which tissues may be involved. The visual response to a menace (i.e, blinking in response to an object being brought close to the eye), as well as aversion to bright light, will be assessed. The pupils will be examined for size, shape, symmetry, and light reflexes. If a foreign object is not found, your veterinarian will consider an ulcer of the cornea, or some other naturally occurring cause that is affecting the eye, before looking into the internal parts of the eye for trauma. 









Treatment



The course of treatment will depend on the severity of the injury and the part of the eye that was injured. If the wound is non-perforating and has no wound edge or opening, an Elizabethan collar will be used to prevent your cat from scratching at its eye, along with antibiotic or atropine eye solutions. Non-perforating wounds that have a mild break in the tissue, or a pinpoint wound perforation, may be treated with a soft contact lens, an Elizabethan collar, and antibiotic or atropine solutions.



Injuries requiring surgical exploration or repair:




	Full-thickness corneal lacerations
	Full-thickness wounds with iris involvement
	Full-thickness scleral or corneoscleral lacerations
	Retained foreign object or a posterior scleral (white of the eye) rupture
	Simple nonperforating wound with edges that are moderately or overtly broken, and that are long, or more than two-thirds the corneal thickness




Most of the time, a cornea that has been lacerated due to injury, or has retained a foreign object, is salvageable. However, the further back, or deeper the injury, the poorer the prognosis for retention of vision. Cases that would warrant a poor prognoses, for example, would be an injury to the white, outer membrane of the eyeball, the sclera, or to the fluid part, the vascular layer of the eyeball. If there is no light perception, it may be due to a perforated injury involving the lens; a significant hemorrhage in the vitreous, the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball; or, from retinal detachment. Penetrating injuries usually have a better prognosis then perforating injuries, and blunt traumas carry a poorer prognosis than sharp traumas.



Under most circumstances, your veterinarian will prescribe medications that are suitable to the seriousness of the wound. Antibiotics are usually prescribed, as well as anti-inflammatory medications and analgesics for pain.



Living and Management



Deep or wide penetrating wounds that have not been sutured will need to be rechecked every 24 to 48 hours for the first several days. If the penetrating wound is superficial, rechecking every three to five days until it is healed is sufficient.



As to prevention, take care when introducing new pets into the home if you already have a cat. Shows of authority by the established cat, or aggressive attempts at displacing the “head” cat by the newcomer can result in unintentional injuries. Also, as much as possible, discourage your pet from running through dense vegetation. If you are in an area that carries the risk of having debris transmitted to the eyes, like wooded areas, beaches, etc., it would be a good idea to have a bottle of saline eyewash to irrigate foreign debris from the eye."," and Types

473,Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens,"What Are Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens?
If your kitten has an eye infection, your veterinarian may diagnose them with ophthalmia neonatorum, a general term meaning inflammation of the eye in a newborn. Though the eyelids of kittens are normally closed until they’re about 10–14 days old, bacteria and viruses can still make their way underneath and cause serious infections. Areas especially susceptible to infection include the cornea and conjunctiva.

The conjunctiva is a moist, slippery lining that covers the eyeball and both the upper and lower eyelids. Cats also have a third eyelid in the inner corner of each eye, which is also lined with conjunctiva. On the eyeball, the conjunctiva is clear; on the inside of the three eyelids, it’s light pink.

The cornea is the “window”—the clear outermost surface—of the eye. Because of its curved shape, the cornea, like a window, bends light as it enters the eye. The cornea is made up of three clear, specialized layers of cells.

When infection occurs in newborn kittens, where the eyelids are still closed, thick pus forms underneath the eyelids and can cause serious, permanent damage to the surface of the cornea—scarring it, making it impermeable to light. Also, with an infection, the conjunctiva can stick to the cornea. Conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva is inflamed.

Types of Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens

Although puppies can have this condition as well, ophthalmia neonatorum in kittens typically involves feline herpesvirus (FHV) and/or Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Chlamydia, or Mycoplasma bacteria as the underlying cause of infection.

Causes of Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens
Because the conjunctiva and cornea are so susceptible to infections in newborn kittens, the eyes most commonly become infected as they pass through their mother’s birth canal and come in contact with fluid that is infected with bacteria.

Similarly, feline herpesvirus is a contagious virus transmitted by direct contact of infected fluids. Droplets can be passed on to newborn kittens from an infected cat. Therefore, it’s important to keep all cats other than the newborn kittens’ mother away from them.

Although all cats are susceptible to FHV, newborn kittens are fragile; their immature immune system increases their likelihood of infection. Crowded, unclean, and/or stressful living conditions contribute to infection as well.

Ocular discharge can also be caused by a congenital abnormality that causes pain and damage to the cornea.

Signs of Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens
Kittens can be infected underneath their closed eyelids or after their eyelids are open, but in general, eye infections are noticed when a kitten is between 7–14 days old.

Signs of eye infections in newborn kittens whose eyes are still closed or who are less than 14 days old include:


	
	Sneezing or nasal discharge
	
	
	Swollen eyelid
	
	
	Clear or thick pus or discharge seeping out from under the eyelid
	
	
	Crust around the eyelid
	
	
	Sores on the eyelid
	
	
	Collapsed or deflated eye
	


Signs in kittens whose eyes are open or who are 15 days old or older include:


	
	The eyelid remaining closed beyond 14 days old
	
	
	Sneezing or nasal discharge
	
	
	Swelling and redness in and around the eyes
	
	
	Clear or thick pus or discharge
	
	
	Crust on or around the eyelid
	
	
	Eyelid that seems stuck to the eye
	
	
	Collapsed or deflated eye
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens
Diagnosis is largely based on clinical signs of infection. The vet will do a thorough physical exam of the kitten as well as of the mother to evaluate her overall health.

During this exam, your vet will use warm water to gently open the kitten’s eyes to do an ophthalmic (eye) exam. Once opened, the eyes will be carefully flushed and a fluorescein dye (a diagnostic contrast agent) will be applied to the cornea. This yellowish-green fluorescent stain is absorbed into and illuminates any layers of the cornea that are injured, making any injuries or ulcers visible.

If your kitten’s eyes are still closed, having the veterinarian open the eyes prematurely does not hurt or damage them.

Additionally, samples of eye discharge and discharge from the mother’s birth canal may be sent out to a lab for bacterial culture/susceptibility testing. With this, specific bacteria can be identified to help guide treatment options.

Treatment of Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens
Because serious and permanent damage—including dry eye, corneal scarring, blindness, and rupture of the eye itself—can occur in eyes that aren’t treated, it’s important to seek veterinary care for both kitten and the mother cat if you notice any signs. Specifically, in kittens with feline herpesvirus, the conjunctiva could adhere to the cornea and prevent the eye from moving properly. This results in impaired vision, loss of function, and damaged tear production.

Because the discharge can permanently damage the cornea, your veterinarian will gently open the eyes to clean and flush out the discharge. Once clean, they’ll be able to evaluate the eye, and depending on their findings, they may prescribe a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic. If FHV is suspected, a topical antiviral may also be used.

For home care, the veterinarian will show you how to massage the eye gently with a warm compress, focusing on moving the discharge toward the inner corner of the eye (medial canthus) to keep the eyes clean. Topical broad spectrum eye drops and topical antiviral eye drops may also be recommended at home.

If a bacterial culture was done, treatment is based on which antibiotic is most effective for the identified bacteria strain.

If a congenital eyelid abnormality is the underlying cause of the ocular discharge, surgery to correct the abnormality is determined depending on the severity.

Recovery and Management of Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens
Because the infection is potentially contagious, it’s best to keep the kitten and the litter isolated from other cats in the household until all kitties are fully recovered and clear of infection.

Typical treatment can last up to four weeks, and it’s critical to follow your veterinarian’s instructions during this time, paying close attention to maintaining a clean environment where your cat can comfortably recover.

474,Eye Defects (Congenital) in Cats,"Congenital Ocular Anomalies in Cats



Congenital abnormalities of the eyeball or its surrounding tissue can be evident in a kitten shortly after birth, or may develop within the first six to eight weeks of life. Most defects are genetically inherited; for example, photoreceptor dysplasia, which is indicated by pupils inability to contract normally in response to light, is more prone in Abyssinian, Persian, and Domestic Shorthair cats. This affects the cat's ability to see in both low light and daylight.



Ocular abnormalities can also develop spontaneously (e.g., colobomas of ther anterior) or occur in utero. Exposure to toxic compounds, lack of nutrients, and systemic infections and inflammations during pregnancy (such as panleukopenia) are other potential risk factors for ocular abnormalities.



Symptoms and Types



There are a variety of abnormalities that can affect a cat's eye or surrounding tissues. The following are some of the more common issues and their corresponding signs:




	Colobomas of the lid
	
		May appear as notch in eyelid, or tissue of the eyelid may be missing
		Often affects the upper lid
		Variable eyelid twitching and watery eyes
		Inherited in Burmese, Persian, and Siamese cats
	
	
	Colobomas of the iris
	
		Misshapen iris
		Sensitivity to bright light
	
	
	Persistent pupillary membranes (PPM)
	
		Fetal tissue will remain on the eye after birth; rare in cats
		Variable iris defects
		Variable cataracts
		Variable colobomas of the uvea
	
	
	Dermoids
	
		Tumor-like cysts on eyelid(s) conjuctiva, or cornea
		Variable eyelid twitching and watery eyes
	
	
	Iris cysts
	
		Often not visible, as the cyst is located behind the iris
		May not have symptoms besides slight bulging of the iris, unless the cyst is interfering with the field of vision
	
	
	Congenital glaucoma (high pressure within the eye) with buphthalmos (abnormal enlargement of eyeball)
	
		Tearing
		Enlarged, red, and painful eye
	
	
	Congenital cataracts
	
		Cloudiness in the eyes
		Often inherited
	
	
	Other congenital issues
	
		Lack of pupils or abnormally-shaped pupil
		Lack of tear duct openings
		Lack of iris
	
	
	Persistent hyperplastic tunica vasculosa lentis (PHTVL) and persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV)
	
		Begins in utero, with progressive atrophy of the vascular system that supports the eye lens
	
	
	Retinal dysplasia
	
		Appears as folds or rosette shapes on the retina
		Affects kittens that have been exposed and infected with feline leukemia or feline panleukopenia, either while in utero or after birth
	
	
	Photoreceptor dysplasia
	
		Night blindness (when rods are affected)
		Day blindness (when cones are affected)
		Slow or absent pupillary reflex to light (when pupil does not contract or dilate normally)
		Involuntary eye movement
	
	
	Rod-cone malformation
	
		Initially pupillary dilatation (2-3 weeks), followed by retinal degeneration (4-5 weeks), and then night and day blindness (8 weeks)
		Inherited in Persians, Abyssinians, and American mixed-breeds
	
	




In addition, hereditary defects, such as corneal opacities, cataracts, retinal detachement, and dysplasia, are often associated with the following factors:


	Abnormally small eyes
	Missing eyeball
	Hidden eyeball (due to other eye deformities)




Causes




	Genetic
	Spontaneous malformations of unknown causes
	Uterine conditions (e.g., infections and inflammations during pregnancy)
	Exposure to toxins during pregnancy
	Nutritional deficiencies during pregnancy




Diagnosis



You will need to provide as much of your cat's medical history as you have available to you, such as in utero conditions (i.e., whether its mother was ill, her diet, etc.), and the cat's development and environment after birth. After taking a thorough history, your veterinarian will test the health of the eye.



A Schirmer tear test may be used to see if your cat's eyes are producing an adequate amount of tears. If abnormally high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is suspected, a diagnostic tool called a tonometer will be applied to your cat's eye to measure its internal pressure. Abnormalities within the eye, meanwhile, will be examined with an indirect ophthalmoscope and/or a slitlamp biomicroscope.



An ultrasound of the eyes may also reveal problems with the lens of the eyeball, the vitreous humor (the clear fluid which fills the space between the lens and retina), the retina, or other problems that are taking place in the posterior (back) segment of the eye. In the case of iris cysts, ultrasound will help your doctor determine if the mass behind the iris is in fact a cyst or a tumor. Cysts do not always behave uniformly: some grow, while others shrink. In most cases follow-ups to check the progress of the cyst will be the extent of treatment, until further intervention is warranted.



Another useful diagnostic method called angiography can also be used for viewing problems in the posterior of the eye, such as detachment of the retina and abnormal blood vessels in the eye. In this method, a substance that is visible on X-ray (radiopaque) is injected into the area that needs to be visualized, so that the full course of blood vessels can be examined for irregularities.







Treatment



Treatment will depend on the specific type of eye abnormality that is affecting your cat. Depending on your veterinarian's experience with eye diseases, you may need further treatment with a trained veterinary ophthalmologist. Surgery can repair some congenital birth defects, and medicines can be used to mitigate the effects of some types of defects. Congenital keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), commonly known as dry eye, can often be medically treated with tear substitutes in combination with antibiotics. Other medicines called mydriatics may be used to increase vision when congenital cataracts are present in the center of your cat's eye lenses.



In cases of photoreceptor dysplasia, there is no medical treatment that will delay or prevent its progress, but cats with this condition generally do not suffer from any other physical abnormality and can learn to manage their environment very well, as long as they are able to depend on their environment being stable and safe.

  

Living and Management



Congenital KCS requires frequent checkups with a veterinarian to monitor tear production and the status of the external eye structures. Abnormalities such as congenital cataracts, PHTVL, and PHPV require checkups twice yearly to monitor progression.



In addition, since most congenital ocular anomalies are hereditary, you should not breed a cat that has been diagnosed with any of these disorders."," and Types

475,Excess Sodium in the Blood in Cats,"Hypernatremia in Cats
 
Hypernatremia is the term used to denote abnormally high levels of sodium in blood. A vital electrolyte, sodium is involved in many critical bodily functions, including maintaining blood pressure, blood volume, maintain the delicate acid/base balance in the body, as well as play a role in the transmission of nerve impulses (signals) within nerves.
 
A common source of sodium is table salt (NaCl). Due to the presence of chloride (Cl) in NaCl, chloride derangements are commonly seen along with sodium.
 
If not treated quickly, hypernatremia can lead to severe consequences for the health of your cat.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Increased thirst (polydipsia) and consumption of water
    Confusion and disorientation
    Coma
    Seizures
    Other symptoms may be related to underlying cause

 
Causes
 

    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    High water loss through urine (as seen with diabetes)
    Intravenous fluid therapy containing NaCl
    Lower water intake
    High oral sodium intake (rare)

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your cat, including a history of any previous medical treatment. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, which will reveal high levels of sodium along with other abnormalities. For cats with diabetes, urinalysis will reveal changes in urine, including low sodium levels. More specific testing for diagnosis of underlying diseases may need to be carried out.


 


Treatment
 
Fluid therapy is commonly used to correct the electrolyte balance. In dehydrated cats, fluid therapy needs to be carried out over some time to correct fluid and electrolyte derangements. Your veterinarian will measure the sodium and other electrolyte levels during and after the treatment to ensure that levels of electrolytes are within normal ranges. Treatment of underlying causes (e.g., diabetes) is essential for complete resolution of the problem and to prevent future episodes.
 
Living and Management
 
Follow guidelines given by your cat’s veterinarian. Ensure continuous supply of water for those patients with diabetes. A sodium restricted diet may be suggested for your cat. Don’t give treats to your cat, especially those with sodium chloride, without discussing with your veterinarian. Stick with the diet recommended for your cat until complete recovery is achieved.
 
Most cats with hypernatremia without any underlying disease respond well and prognosis is excellent. However, animals with an underlying disease responsible for electrolyte derangements, prognosis depends on treatment of the disease along with correction of electrolyte imbalances."," and Types

476,Excess Protein in Cat Urine (Proteinuria in Cats),"What Is Proteinuria in Cats?
Proteinuria occurs when there is too much protein in your cat’s urine. While some protein in feline urine is normal, high levels that don’t drop normally can be a sign of an underlying health issue. 

Like other mammals, a cat’s urine is first formed in the kidneys, where blood is filtered through a special filtration system. This filtration removes toxins and other byproducts of metabolism, including proteins. A structure in the kidneys called the glomerulus is part of this filtration system. One of its jobs is to prevent larger proteins, like albumin, from exiting the body in the urine.  

Proteinuria may be a sign that the kidneys are not functioning normally and allowing larger proteins to mix into the urine. Excessive protein in a cat’s urine—even on routine urine testing—warrants further investigation to identify what’s causing it. The earlier the cause of proteinuria is determined and treated, the more likely a positive outcome.

Symptoms of Proteinuria in Cats
There are usually no clinical signs of proteinuria in cats. It is often diagnosed during routine, annual health examinations, where bloodwork and urine samples are routinely tested. Symptoms are usually the result of the underlying cause of the proteinuria and not the proteinuria itself.

If symptoms are present, they may include:


	
	Blood in the urine
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	Frequent, small urinations
	
	
	A strong odor to the urine
	


In more severe cases caused by underlying chronic kidney disease and/or kidney failure, symptoms may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite or loss of appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Increased thirst
	
	
	Increased urination
	
	
	Lack of urine production
	
	
	Edema (swelling of the limbs)
	
	
	Ascites (fluid in the abdomen)
	


If your vet finds high levels of protein in your cat’s urine, or levels that remain high for too long, they will likely order additional testing. 

Causes of Proteinuria in Cats
Bleeding or inflammation in the urinary tract are the most common causes of protein in cat urine. Usually, this is caused by inflammation in the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra). Less commonly, the prostate gland, uterus, or vagina may also contribute.

Inflammation or bleeding in the lower urinary tract is most often due to:


	
	Urinary tract infection (UTI)
	
	
	Urinary tract stones (kidney, bladder, or urethral)
	
	
	Crystals in the urine
	
	
	Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC)
	


Other less-frequent causes of protein in urine include:


	
	Urinary tract polyps
	
	
	High-protein cat diets
	
	
	Drug reactions
	
	
	Acute pancreatitis
	


Diagnosis and treatment of these underlying conditions usually resolves the proteinuria.

If the protein in your cat’s urine is not associated with inflammation or bleeding, then kidney disease or other systemic diseases may be the cause. Your vet will perform additional diagnostic tests to identify kidney disease.

Other chronic and concerning causes of proteinuria include:


	
	Hypertension (elevated blood pressure)
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism
	
	
	Tick-borne disease
	
	
	Diabetes
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Toxins
	
	
	Cancers
	
	
	Viruses
	
	
	Any systemic immune-mediated or inflammatory condition
	
	
	Chronic renal disease/renal failure.
	


Chronic causes of proteinuria require long-term or even lifelong treatment to lessen the protein in the urine.

How Vets Diagnose Proteinuria in Cats
Vets usually first diagnose proteinuria through urinalysis. This test is conducted on a simple urine sample. During the exam, your vet will collect a urine sample with a dipstick and evaluate sediment. 

Urinalysis measures the amount of protein in the urine while also assessing for blood and any causes of inflammation, such as crystals, bacteria, and casts (tube-shaped particles made up of cells, protein, or fat).

If more testing is needed, the standard method to obtain urine is called a cystocentesis. For this common procedure, your veterinarian inserts a needle directly into your cat’s bladder to obtain a urine sample. The process is often guided by ultrasound and produces the most sterile sample.  This sample is then sent to the lab for a general urine profile or urinalysis.

If urinalysis reveals blood or inflammation, your veterinarian will likely recommend further testing, including: 


	
	Urine culture to look for infection
	
	
	Abdominal x-rays to look for bladder/urethral stones
	
	
	X-rays or ultrasound to look for reproductive or prostate disease
	


After your cat receives appropriate treatment, your vet will repeat the urine testing to monitor for persistent proteinuria.

If elevated protein appears in the urine sample without signs of inflammation or bleeding, then your vet will conduct further diagnostic testing to investigate kidney disease and other systemic causes.

This may include full bloodwork to assess kidney function and protein levels as well as a urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) test. Often, your vet will take your cat’s blood pressure to rule out high blood pressure.  

If the cause remains unknown, your veterinarian may discuss more thorough tests, such as abdominal ultrasound, infectious disease testing, or viral testing. 

Kidney biopsy, which is used to diagnose glomerular disease, is widely considered a last resort. Kidney biopsy is an aggressive, invasive diagnostic test with the potential for significant complications. It is usually performed via abdominal surgery with ultrasound guidance or with a minimally invasive laparoscope.  

Treatment for Proteinuria in Cats
Once your vet figures out what is causing your cat’s proteinuria, they will prescribe the best course of treatment. Treatments vary depending on the cause.


	
	Urinary tract infections are often treated with antibiotics and have an excellent chance of recovery.
	
	
	Inflammation of the bladder without infection (feline idiopathic cystitis) is typically treated with anti-inflammatories and pain medications.
	
	
	Bladder crystals can be treated with diet changes and increased water intake.
	
	
	Bladder stones are usually dissolved via diet change or are surgically removed from the bladder via a procedure termed cystotomy. 
	
	
	Polyps in the bladder often can be surgically removed via bladder surgery or cystoscopy.
	
	
	Treating and controlling diseases such as hypertension, hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, and diabetes may reduce lessen or even resolve proteinuria in cats.  
	
	
	Kidney disease or kidney failure treatment depends on the severity of the disease.
	


The goal of therapy in cats with kidney disease is to decrease the proteinuria by more than 90%, which may not be possible if the disease is severe.

Treatment may include only a diet change to a low-protein, low-phosphorus diet in the early stages of kidney disease. As the disease progresses, fluid may be administered under the skin. You can be educated on how to perform this therapy at home.

In more severe cases of renal failure, hospitalization with IV fluids may be recommended to correct dehydration, administer electrolytes, and flush/cleanse the kidneys to help lower kidney enzymes and support overall health.

Recovery and Management of Proteinuria in Cats
Most cats with proteinuria caused by acute inflammation or bleeding have an excellent chance of recovering. While they are at risk for recurring urinary issues in the future, they often recover completely with therapy.

Cats with renal disease are often placed on a lifelong prescription diet with low protein and phosphorus. Sometimes, your vet may also prescribe probiotics or kidney supplements (especially omega-3 fatty acids). It is important to discuss any supplements with your veterinarian before giving them to your cat.

Subcutaneous (under-the-skin) fluid administration at home can be helpful in maintaining hydration levels, providing electrolyte support, and flushing the kidneys. Your veterinarian can educate you on how to perform this therapy at home, including which types of fluids to use, how much to administer, and how frequently to do it.

In cases of urinary tract neoplasia, or cancer, surgery and chemotherapy are often used to achieve remission and improve quality of life. Unfortunately, most types of cancers in the urinary tract are aggressive, and even with treatment, they are not usually cured.

Chronic kidney disease is usually monitored closely with frequent visits to the vet for examination, weight checks, blood work, urinalysis, and urine protein creatinine ratio and blood pressure testing to help track any improvement and monitor the disease.

When the disease progresses, oral medications can help support the kidneys, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Your vet may also prescribe immunosuppressive therapy or anticoagulants, depending on the cause and severity of the kidney disease. 
Proteinuria in Cats FAQsWhat does high protein in cat urine mean?Proteinuria means there is too much protein in your cat’s urine. Persistent and excess protein levels in the urine are abnormal and usually have an underlying cause. Your veterinarian will investigate what is causing the proteinuria and determine the best treatment options for your cat.
WRITTEN BYKatie Grzyb, DVMVeterinarianDr. Katie Grzyb received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Ross University in 2009. She continued her clinical training at..."," of Proteinuria in Cats
There are usually no clinical signs of proteinuria in cats. It is often diagnosed during routine, annual health examinations, where bloodwork and urine samples are routinely tested. Symptoms are usually the result of the underlying cause of the proteinuria and not the proteinuria itself.

If symptoms are present, they may include:


	
	Blood in the urine
	
	
	Straining to urinate
	
	
	Frequent, small urinations
	
	
	A strong odor to the urine
	


In more severe cases caused by underlying chronic kidney disease and/or kidney failure, symptoms may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite or loss of appetite
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Increased thirst
	
	
	Increased urination
	
	
	Lack of urine production
	
	
	Edema (swelling of the limbs)
	
	
	Ascites (fluid in the abdomen)
	


If your vet finds high levels of protein in your cat’s urine, or levels that remain high for too long, they will likely order additional testing.

477,Excess Plasma Proteins in the Blood (Hyperviscosity) in Cats,"Hyperviscosity Syndrome in Cats
 
Thickening of the blood, medically referred to as hyperviscosity, or high blood viscosity, typically results from markedly high concentration of blood plasma proteins, although it can also result (rarely) from an extremely high red blood cell count. It is most frequently seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome (the consequence of the presence of cancer in the body), and is often associated with multiple myeloma (a cancer of the plasma cell) and other lymphoid tumors or leukemias.
 
The clinical signs that are associated with hyperviscosity are caused by reduced blood flow through smaller vessels, high plasma volume, and associated coagulopathy (a defect in the body's mechanism for blood clotting). There are no gender or breed predilections, and though it is generally rare in cats, when it does occur, it is more frequently found in older cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    No consistent signs
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Lethargy
    Depression
    Excessive urination and excessive thirst
    Blindness, unsteadiness
    Bleeding tendencies
    Seizures and disorientation
    Rapid heartbeat and rapid breathing if congestive heart failure present owing to volume overload
    Nosebleed or other bleeding in the mucus membranes
    Visual deficits associated with engorged retinal vessels, retinal hemorrhage or detachment, and optic swelling

 
Causes
 

    Multiple myeloma and plasma cell tumors
    Lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma
    Marked polycythemia (a net increase in the total number of blood cells)
    Chronic atypical inflammation with monoclonal gammopathy (in which an abnormal protein has been detected in the blood)
    Chronic autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus rheumatoid arthritis)




Diagnosis
 
Hyperviscosity is a syndrome, not a final diagnosis; however, your veterinarian will want to know what accounts for the symptoms. veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will be specifically looking at total plasma protein count and evidence of blood disorders. Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, your veterinarian will work out a treatment plan.  



Treatment
 
Generally, cats that present with this disease are treated on an inpatient basis. It will be the underlying disease that will be the focus of the treatment. The total treatment plan will be based upon whether the symptoms are being caused by cancer or by an inflammatory condition.

Living and Management
 
Even after you take your cat home, your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat's serum or plasma proteins frequently to mark the effectiveness of the treatment. Follow-up blood tests will also be conducted, along with urinalyses from time to time, to determine how well your cat is dealing with the disease."," and Types

478,Excess Magnesium in the Blood in Cats,"Hypermagnesemia in Cats
 
Electrolytes are required in the body for many vital functions, like keeping fluid balance, normal heart and brain functions, delivery of oxygen, and many more. Magnesium, after potassium, is the second most abundant positively charged electrolyte found inside cells. Bones and muscles contain a major portion of magnesium in the body. Hypermagnesemia is the term used to denote abnormally high levels of magnesium in the body. Higher levels of magnesium can result in serious complications like impaired nerve impulses (signals), as well as cardiac problems.
 
It is uncommon in cats, mostly seen in patients with underlying kidney diseases. High level of magnesium may result in life-threatening conditions, including those of the nervous system and the heart.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Hypermagnesemia leads to the progressive loss of respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, and muscle functions -- all of which can be fatal in the dog. Other symptoms associated with this issue include:
 

    Nausea
    Vomiting
    Weakness
    Lowered heart rate
    Paralysis
    Mental depression
    Poor reflexes
    Respiratory depression
    Cardiac arrest
    Coma

 
Causes
 

    Kidney failure
    Poor intestinal motility
    Constipation
    Administration of high levels of magnesium
    Endocrine disorders (e.g., hypoadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism)

 
Diagnosis
 
After recording a detailed history from you, the veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests help determine the levels of magnesium in the blood, which will record more than normal in affected cats. Abnormally high levels of calcium are also found in affected cats. As hypermagnesemia mostly occurs in patients with kidney problems, urinalysis and other laboratory tests may reveal abnormalities related to an underlying disease. Additionally, your veterinarian will perform an electrocardiography (ECG), as characteristic ECG changes are seen in patients with hypermagnesemia.


 


Treatment
 
The major goal of treatment is to enhance the elimination of extra magnesium from the body. All medications containing magnesium will be discontinued to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. Fluid therapy will be started to enhance the excretion of magnesium from the body of your cat. Calcium is also added in your cat’s therapy to enhance the excretion of magnesium.
 
During and/or after treatment, your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing to see the levels of magnesium. An ECG will be conducted to see cardiac functions.
 
Living and Management
 
Prognosis in cats with hypermagnesemia without kidney involvement is excellent after initial therapy. In cases of kidney disease, on the other hand, treating the underlying disease is essential for resolution of the problem on a permanent basis. Levels of magnesium will be monitored during and after the treatment. After discharge, if you see any untoward signs, immediately call your cat’s veterinarian."," and Types

479,Excessive Production of Saliva in Cats,"Ptyalism in Cats



Saliva is constantly produced and secreted into the oral cavity from the salivary glands. Production of saliva increases because of excitation of the salivary nuclei in the brain stem. Ptyalism is a medical condition characterized by the excessive flow of saliva, also referred to as hypersalivation. The stimuli that lead to the over production of saliva are taste and touch sensations involving the mouth and tongue. Higher centers in the central nervous system can also excite or inhibit the salivary nuclei, and lesions involving either the central nervous system or the oral cavity can cause excessive salivation as well. Diseases that affect the pharynx, esophagus, and stomach can also stimulate excessive production of saliva. Ingestion of a toxin, caustic agent, or foreign body can also lead to ptyalism. Conversely, normal saliva production may appear excessive in animals with an anatomic abnormality that allows saliva to dribble out of the mouth, or are affected with a condition that affects swallowing. Pseudoptyalism (i.e., false ptyalism), on the other hand, is the release of excess saliva that has accumulated in the oral cavity.



Young cats may be more likely to have a form of ptyalism caused by a congenital problem, such as portosystemic shunt. Under normal conditions, the portal vein enters the liver and allows toxic components of the blood to be detoxified by the liver. When a shunt is present, the portal vein is inappropriately connected to another vein, which causes blood to bypass the liver. Enlargement of the esophagus is hereditary in Siamese cats.



Symptoms and Types




	Loss of appetite - seen most often in cats with oral lesions, gastrointestinal disease, and systemic disease
	Eating behavior changes - cats with oral disease or cranial nerve dysfunction may refuse to eat hard food, not chew on the affected side (when the lesion is unilateral), hold the head in an unusual position while eating, or drop food
	Other behavioral changes - irritability, aggressiveness, and reclusiveness are common, especially for cats with a painful condition
	Difficulty swallowing
	Regurgitation - in cats with esophageal disease
	Vomiting - secondary to gastrointestinal or systemic disease
	Pawing at the face or muzzle - cats with oral discomfort or pain
	Neurologic signs - cats that have been exposed to causative drugs or toxins, and those with hepatic encephalopathy following consumption of a meal high in protein

		Substances with a disagreeable taste (cats tend to react by drooling)
		Substances that induce hypersalivation.
		Animal venom (e.g., black widow spiders, Gila monsters, and North American scorpions)
		Toad and newt secretions
		Plant consumption may cause increased salivation (e.g., poinsettia, Dieffenbachia)
	
	




  



Diagnosis



There are many different causes for excessive salivation. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including vaccination status, current medications, possible toxin exposure, a background history of symptoms, and any other possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Your doctor will need to distinguish between hypersalivation associated with a condition that is causing difficulty swallowing, from hypersalivation associated with nausea by looking for signs such as depression, lip smacking, and retching. Your doctor will also want to perform a complete physical and neurologic examination on your cat, with special attention paid to the oral cavity and neck. Diagnostic tools may include x-ray and ultrasound imaging to determine whether there is a problem in the structure of the liver, or in any other internal organs. If an immune-related disorder is suspected, your veterinarian may also want to conduct a biopsy of tissue and cells.





Treatment



Your veterinarian will treat the underlying cause of the ptyalism, once it has been effectively diagnosed. Although it is generally not necessary, your doctor may also treat the outward symptoms to reduce the flow of saliva. Nutritional supplements may be recommended if your cat has been suffering from ptyalism for any length of time and has not been able to eat properly.



Living and Management



Depending on the underlying cause, your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat as often as necessary to make certain that the treatment plan is effective."," and Types

480,Excessive Growth Hormone (Somatotropin) in Cats,"Acromegaly in Cats

Acromegaly is a rare syndrome resulting from the excessive production of the growth hormone somatotropin by tumors in the anterior pituitary gland of adult cats. Clinical signs of this syndrome are a result of the hormone's direct catabolic (breaking down) and indirect anabolic (building up) effects. 

The anabolic effects, meanwhile, are mediated by somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor I), which is secreted by the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation. The excessive levels of somatomedin C, however, promote protein synthesis and growth in a variety of tissues such as the bone cartilage, soft tissues, especially in the head and neck region. Eventually these abnormalities in joint cartilage growth and metabolism alter normal joint biomechanics, which can lead to degenerative joint disease. 

Somatotropin also fights the action of insulin, which eventually causes pancreatic cell exhaustion and permanent diabetes mellitus.

Symptoms and Types

Initially, signs relate to unregulated diabetes mellitus. As the disease progresses, signs of heart failure, kidney failure, or central nervous system abnormalities caused by tumor expansion develop, including:


    Increased appetite (polyphagia)
    Excessive drinking (polydipsia)
    Excessive urinating (polyuria)
    Broadening of the facial features and lengthening of the lower jaw are common
    Weight loss (initially), followed by weight gain due to increased bone and soft tissue mass
    Systolic heart murmurs
    Seizures and/or other central nervous system signs


Causes

The hypersecretion of the growth hormone somatotropin by an anterior pituitary tumor.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel.

Other diagnostic exams include X-rays, echocardiogram, and CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. CT and MRI scans are used to locate the pituitary mass. X-rays, meanwhile, often reveal an enlarged heart and sometimes fluid in the lungs, especially if left-sided congestive heart failure has already developed. And an echocardiogram will confirm heart abnormalities.

A radioimmunoassay for plasma somatomedin C is available at Michigan State University -- which can confirm the elevated plasma levels associated with acromegaly -- but this is often impractical.

Treatment

Often, the goal is to treat and control the secondary diseases that develop following prolonged growth hormone hypersecretion (e.g., diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and kidney failure). However, there have been some successful attempts at treating the acromegaly.

In one study, for example, cobalt radiotherapy was used in which six out of seven acromegalic cats showed permanent or temporary resolution of insulin resistance following therapy. In another case, the surgical removal of the pituary tumor by freezing (cryohypophysectomy) also showed success. The cat slowly regained normal plasma somatomedin C levels and the diabetes mellitus resolved after two months.

Consult your veterinarian for the best course of treatment for your animal.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you to treat your pet's secondary complications, as necessary.  Unfortunately, cats are usually euthanized or die because of complications associated with congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and/or progressive central nervous system signs (seizures, etc.).  Reported survival times following diagnosis range from 4 to 42 months, with a median of 20 months."," and Types

"
481,Excessive Blood Clotting in Cats,"Hypercoagulability in Cats

Blood platelets are minute, disc shaped cell fragments in the blood that are responsible for clotting the blood. Too many active platelets, or too few active platelets, can result in severe health disorders. One of these disorders, hypercoagulability (hyper-clotting), has several causes, but in essence it reflects a greater amount of procoagulants than anticoagulants in the blood. This means that the blood coagulates (clots) abnormally more than usual. One of the possible causes of hypercoagulability is when there are too many active platelets in the blood. The end result of hypercoagulability is an episode of thrombosis, where clots will get trapped in arteries, veins, or in the heart, causing a loss of blood to the areas these arteries feed. Hypercoagulability is usually secondary to an underlying disease.

Symptoms and Types

A blood clot that is blocking arteries in the lungs will present as severe breathing difficulties that come on suddenly. Rapid breathing, lack of energy, and possible fever are also be symptoms of an arterial blood clot. A blood clot blocking the aortic artery – the major artery from the heart to the body – will show as sudden weakness or paralysis, pain in the limbs, an absent or weak pulse in the arteries on the inside of the thigh, cold limbs, or blue-purple colored nails

Causes

Hypercoagulability onset may be due to blood platelets that are stickier than normal, resulting in too much clotting of blood cells; deficiencies in antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant that prevents clotting in the arteries and veins; decreased removal of coagulation factors - that is, not enough procoagulants are being removed, resulting in an abundance of coagulating factors; or, defective fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the process where fibrin, the protein end product of blood coagulation, is dissolved, resulting in the removal of small blood clots from the bloodstream.

Some of the other causes for this condition are:


    Protein-losing nephropathy: a condition which causes a loss of protein from the intestines so that anti-clotting/anticoagulant proteins are lacking
    Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia: the abnormal breakdown of blood vessels
    Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy: a serious disease of the blood vessels, which is usually secondary to a life-threatening illness, or precipitated by a bacterial infection in the blood (sepsis)
    Inflammation of the pancreas
    Parasite infection: specifically with Dirofilaria, a genus of worms that includes the heartworm
    Under-functioning thyroid gland
    Cancer


Diagnosis

Since hypercoagulability is usually the result of an underlying disease, your veterinarian will order tests for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to measure how quickly your cat's blood is clotting, in addition to a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, and a comprehensive urinalysis.

Chest x-rays will help to visualize abnormalities in the lungs, and an abdominal ultrasound may be used to further examine the body for an aortic artery blockage. An echocardiogram can also be used, for diagnosing blood clots in the heart, and for detecting high blood pressure in the lungs that may be present due to blood clots there.

An examination using an injection of a radiopaque substance in order to view the blood vessels, called angiography, may also be necessary for confirming a blood clot. Another test, called nuclear perfusion scintigraphy, uses a radioactive tracer to illuminate the internal body, and is useful for noninvasively diagnosing blood clots in the lungs.

Treatment

If necessary, your veterinarian will hospitalize your cat for anticoagulant and fluid therapy. Your cat's activity will be severely restricted until the condition has reversed. Bed rest is essential when an animal has a blood clot blocking an artery, since physical activity can rush the clot into an essential supply organ or vein. For this reason, your cat will be placed on oxygen cage therapy if the blood clot is in the arteries or the lungs. If the underlying disease causing hypercoagulability cannot be resolved, subsequent clotting episodes will probably occur.

If anticoagulant medicines are indicated, your veterinarian will decide how much, and how long to administer these medicines. The course of medication and therapy will be dependent on the amount of time it takes for your pet’s blood to clot after treatment.

Living and Management

You will need to schedule check-ups with your veterinarian to monitor your cat's prothrombin times (clotting times) twice a week following discharge from care. After that, your doctor will probably begin scheduling your cat for weekly check-ups over several weeks, until it is certain that the condition has been resolved. Once this stage has been reached, your cat can be seen once about every two months or more."," and Types

"
482,Excessive Blood Clotting in Cats,"Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) in Cats

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a bleeding problem in which clotting factors are activated with an absence of injury. Micro clots form within the blood vessels, and the clotted material goes on to consume platelets and proteins, using them up and leaving  a lack of sufficient clotting factors and platelets. This condition can lead to a disruption in normal blood flow to the organs and excessive bleeding, both external and internal.

Clotting factors, such as proteins in the blood plasma, are components of the bloodstream, coordinating with platelet cells to stop bleeding at the site of an injury by forming into a gel-like plug. Platelets are normal cell fragments that originate in the bone marrow and travel in the blood as it circulates through the body. Platelets act to plug tears in the blood vessels and stop bleeding.

DIC occurs secondarily and in response an existing diseased condition. There is no breed, gender or age predisposition, though this condition is less common in cats than in dogs.

Symptoms and Types


    Small purple-red spots beneath the surface of the skin (petechiae)
    Excessive bleeding after injury, during surgery or after taking blood
    Bleeding from the mouth, nose, anus or vagina
    Blood collecting in the chest and/or abdomen


Causes


    Gastric dilation-volvus - condition in which the stomach dilates with gas and/or fluid, and subsequently rotates around its short axis
    Heart failure
    Heartworm disease
    Heat stroke
    Breakdown of red-blood cells by the immune system
    Inflammation of the stomach and intestines with blood in the feces
    Generalized (systemic) infectious diseases which cause bacterial toxins to accumulate in the blood (endotoxemia)
    Liver disease
    Cancer
    Nephrotic syndrome - a medical condition in which protein is dropped in the urine, low levels of albumin (a type of protein) and high levels of cholesterol are found in the blood, and fluid accumulation is present in the abdomen, chest, and/or under the skin
    Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
    Shock and low levels of oxygen in the blood and tissues (hypoxia)
    Thrombocytopenia - Low platelet or thrombocyte counts caused by the immune system destroying the platelets
    Trauma
    Venom


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as a possible run-in with an insect or venomous animal. Standard tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to look for underlying systemic disease that is causing this response. Some of the possible concurrent conditions that will be found are anemia – fragmented red blood cells (RBCs) will be indicative of this; and thrombocytopenia – a low platelet count.

A blood clotting profile will be performed on your cat's blood to measure the time it takes to clot. Blood tests will show low levels of fibrinogen, increased D-dimers and decreased antithrombin-III (factors in the clotting process) if your cat is being affected by disseminated intravascular coagulation.

When thrombocytopenia is found occurring along with a prolonged clotting time and spontaneous bleeding, DIC may be safely assumed to be the conclusive diagnosis.

  

Treatment

Your cat should be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and treated aggressively for the underlying disease. Your cat's activity will need to be restricted to avoid incidental bleeding, which can occur as the result of even small and seemingly minor injuries. Fluid therapy, oxygen and blood plasma transfusions should be administered to the cat.

Your veterinarian may choose to use heparin to slow any further progression of clotting, but this drug will need to be used with extreme caution, as high doses can lead to fatal hemorrhaging.

Living and Management

If your cat has been diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation, it must remain in the hospital until the  bleeding has been brought under control and signs of improvement have progressed with reverse. Unfortunately, the underlying diseases that cause the body to react this way are generally very severe, and animals that are suffering from DIC, along with the causative condition, tend not to survive. Prompt and aggressive treatment is the only possible method for preventing a rapid and morbid progression."," and Types


    Small purple-red spots beneath the surface of the skin (petechiae)
    Excessive bleeding after injury, during surgery or after taking blood
    Bleeding from the mouth, nose, anus or vagina
    Blood collecting in the chest and/or abdomen

483,Excessive Bacteria in the Small Intestine in Cats,"Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth
 
While it is common for small intestine to have bacteria, it can become a problem when the count is too high. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a disorder which causes an abnormal amount of bacteria to accumulate in the small intestine, which can then affect the normal intestinal functions, causing loose stools and weight loss. Often clearing up within a few days, but up to a few weeks; treatment options for this bacterial infection give an excellent prognosis.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Common symptoms include loose stools, rapid weight loss, diarrhea, occasional vomiting and intestinal tract sounds (gurgling caused by gas).
 
Causes
 
Inadequate levels of thyroid, low pancreatic production of enzymes, low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and intestinal disease are some of the known causes for this bacterial overgrowth.
 
Diagnosis
 
Veterinarians will often perform blood work and bacterial cultures to determine the causes of the intestinal condition. In some cases a more invasive procedure, such as an endoscopy, will be required to view the intestine internally.
 
 
 
Treatment
 
Treatment is commonly given on an outpatient basis and improvement can occur quickly, typically within a few days and up to a few weeks. It is often recommended that the patient be placed on a highly-digestible diet to create less of an impact on the intestines during the healing. Antibiotics are also commonly prescribed to treat the bacterial growth.
 
Living and Management
 
It is important to monitor your cat's weight and protein levels (albumin) over time and ensure progress is being made toward a full recovery. Diarrhea must also be observed because if prolonged, it can lead to severe dehydration. In addition, repeat treatments may be required. The prognosis of this disease is positive when it is not associated with other serious medical conditions, such as intestinal cancer.
 
Prevention
 
There are currently no known preventative methods for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth."," and Types
 
Common symptoms include loose stools, rapid weight loss, diarrhea, occasional vomiting and intestinal tract sounds (gurgling caused by gas).

484,Excess Iron in the Blood in Cats,"Iron Toxicity in Cats

While iron is an essential nutrient for the regular functioning of a cat's body, it can become lethal when it is present in large quantities in the bloodstream. Cats may be ingesting unhealthy amounts of iron when they are being given multivitamins that are not appropriate for their age, size or health status, or when they are ingesting dietary supplements or pregnancy supplements that have been left within their reach but that are not intended for them. In the event that there is a high volume of iron present in the blood, damage can occur within the cells. 

Symptoms and Types

Iron toxicity occurs in cats in four separate stages.

Stage I (0–6 hours)

    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Depression
    Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
    Abdominal pain


Stage II (6–24 hours)

    Apparent recovery


Stage III (12–96 hours)

    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Depression
    Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
    Shock
    Tremors
    Abdominal pain


Stage IV (2–6 weeks)

    Gastrointestinal obstruction from stricture formation


Causes

The most common cause of iron toxicity is the ingestion of pills within the home environment. Contact an emergency hospital or your veterinrian if you believe your cat has ingested a toxic dose of iron.

  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If there is an abnormally high level of iron in the bloodstream, this will show up on the results of the blood tests. If it is suspected that your cat ingested iron pills, diagnostic imaging may be used to help locate them and to determine whether they can be removed from your cat's digestive system before they can be fully absorbed into the body.

Treatment

Fluids will be given to the cat in high doses to help correct the shock and to correct the acidosis that is occurring in the cat's blood stream. If possible, the additional unabsorbed iron pills will be removed from your cat's stomach, either by using antiemetic drugs to induce vomiting, or by performing a gastric lavage. This latter method is done with a saline solution that is slowly pumped into the stomach cavity to wash the contents of the stomach out. The contents are removed in small amounts using another tube.

Living and Management

It is important to monitor the cat's blood enzymes and liver enzymes following the treatment. Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up exam to test the cat's blood to make sure that the iron levels have been controlled. It is also important for you to observe your cat for any signs of gastrointestinal obstruction following the iron toxicity, as the digestive system may react to the toxicity or the medical procedures that were used to resolve the toxicity."," and Types

485,Excess Chloride in the Blood in Cats,"Hyperchloremia in Cats
 
Hyperchloremia refers to abnormally high levels of chloride (an electrolyte) in the blood. Electrolytes play important roles within the dog's body: helping in heart and nervous system functions, fluid balance, delivery of oxygen, and much more. For every electrolyte a very delicate chemical balance is required, and each electrolyte has a specific normal range in the body.
 
The electrolyte chloride, for example, is responsible in part for metabolism (turning food into energy), and keeping the body's acid base balanced. Chloride exists in body with sodium (Na) and their common source is sodium chloride (NaCl or table salt). Therefore, conditions responsible for altering the levels of sodium also affect chloride levels in the body. Elevated chloride levels are usually seen in cats suffering from kidney diseases, diabetes, or bouts of diarrhea.

Hyperchloremia is seen in both cats and dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms of sodium elevation may also exist along with those of hyperchloremia, including:
 

    Increased thirst (polydipsia) and consumption of water
    Mental confusion
    Coma
    Seizures

 
Causes
 

    Diarrhea and/or vomiting
    Over administration of fluids containing NaCl at hospitals
    Lack of access of water for long period of time
    High water loss through urine (often seen in association with diabetes)
    Oral ingestion of chloride (rare in cats)

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history of the cat from you and will conduct a complete physical examination, with routine laboratory tests: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis.

Biochemistry profile results will show abnormally high levels of chloride, often coupled with high sodium levels, and in cases in which diabetes is also involved, blood sugar levels may be abnormal as well. Meanwhile, urinalysis will often reveal abnormalities related to kidney diseases. Laboratory tests will also demonstrate abnormalities related to any underlying disease like diabetes.





Treatment
 
The symptoms will be treated first in order to maintain your cat's immediate health. If the cat is dehydrated, fluids will be given to balance body fluids. Treatment involves treating the underlying disease as well as correcting the levels of both chloride and sodium in the blood. Your veterinarian will select intravenous fluid to balance the levels of both of these electrolytes. If the hyperchloremia has been caused by medications, they will be discontinued immediately.
 
Because it is possible that the increase in chloride is being caused by an underlying physical disorder, treatment will vary depending on the final diagnosis. If your cat has been diagnosed with diabetes, it will be essential to resolve the problem related to it to prevent recurrence. Kidney disease, or a hormonal or endocrine disorder may require specialists, depending on the magnitude of the problem.
 
Living and Management
 
If there is no underlying diseases associated with the abnormally high chloride levels, the cat should recover completely with initial treatment. However, if something is amiss, it is important to treat the underlying disease to facilitate a speedy recovery and prevent recurrence."," and Types

"
486,Excess Carbon Dioxide in the Blood in Cats,"Hypercapnia in Cats
 
Hypercapnia is synonymous with hypoventilation, or inadequate inhalation of fresh air. It is generally the result of alveolar hypoventilation, a failure of the air cells in the lungs to take in adequate amounts of clean oxygen. It may also be related to lung disease or to environmental conditions that result in increased levels of carbon dioxide in the breathable air.
 
Hypercapnia is characterized by an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. Carbon dioxide is a normal part of the atmosphere, and a normal component of the chemical make-up of the mammalian body. Carbon dioxide is the end product of aerobic cellular metabolism (the function of cells that require oxygen to operate). It is considered the primary drive to breath, by stimulation of central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata (the lower portion of the brainstem). It is carried in the blood in three forms: 65 percent is as a bicarbonate; 30 percent is bound to hemoglobin; and 5 percent is dissolved in plasma. As a natural part of the atmosphere and the air that is inhaled, carbon dioxide is constantly being added to and removed from the air cells in the lungs. The normal amount of carbon dixide in the arterial blood is 35-45 mm Hg (a measurable unit of pressure). 
 
However, an excess of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can lead to an abnormal condition, causing symptoms ranging from dizziness to convulsions. Left untreated, a state of hypercapnia can lead to death.
 
Any breed, age, or gender of cat can be affected by this disorder.
 
Symptoms

Because the brain is primarily affected by this condition, nervous  system signs abound. Other symptoms include: 




    Abnormal breathing pattern
    Weakness
    Severe condition may lead to slow heartbeat and slow breathing
    Upper airway obstruction
    Pulmonary parenchymal (internal cells in the lungs) disease
    Hypoventilation owing to muscle weakness or neuropathy
    Excess abdominal fluid

  
Causes
 
Hypoventilation that results from a decrease in alveolar ventilation; may be the result of one of the following:


    Anesthesia
    Muscular paralysis
    Upper airway obstruction
    Air or fluid in the pleural space
    Restriction in movement of the thoracic (chest) cage
    Diaphragmatic hernia (where there is a hole in the diaphragm, allowing a any one of the abdominal organs to push through the hole into the chest space, often interfering with breathing in the process)
    Pulmonary parenchymal disease (disease of the lung tissue)
    Central nervous system disease
    Administration of sodium bicarbonate (used in some foods and  medications, esp. some medicines that are used for treating acidosis),  which dissociates into carbon dioxide when there is inadequate  ventilation


It may also occur spontaneously in patients during inhalation of anesthesia or due to increased inhaled carbon dioxide, such as what occurs from rebreathing gases that had been exhaled. The most common cause, however, is due to an exhausted carbon dioxide absorbent in the anesthesia machine is the most common cause. 

 

Diagnosis
 
Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. If your cat is conscious, your doctor will check your cat for symptoms of hyperthermia (body temperature that is too high), hypoxemia (lack of oxygen), and head trauma.  If your cat is not conscious, especially if it is due to being anesthetized, your veterinarian will check your cat for hypoxemia. 
 
If none of these disorders are found to be the cause of the symptoms, your veterinarian will perform an upper airway endoscopy to rule out a laryngeal mass or paralysis of the larynx (muscles of the throat). 
 
Treatment
 
The definitive treatment is to treat the primary cause, discontinue  inhalation anesthesia, or provide adequate ventilation during  anesthesia. Your veterinarian will begin by providing adequate ventilation into the air cells of the lungs. If your cat is anesthetized, your doctor will accomplish ventilation manually or mechanically with an anesthesia ventilator.

Non-anesthetized cats with severe pulmonary or central nervous system disease can be treated by mechanical ventilation with a critical care ventilator, but the cat may require heavy sedation for this treatment. Supplemental oxygen will be determined by the primary disease, since providing supplemental oxygen without providing ventilation generally will not correct hypercapnia.
 
Living and Management
 
Your doctor will assess the effectiveness of supportive (ventilation) and definitive treatment. This should result in a decrease in the respiratory effort. Arterial blood gas will be evaluated to determine improvement, and to assess the adequacy of your cat's ability to take in adequate amounts of free oxygen as needed.","

"
487,Excess Blood Cells in the Eye in Cats,"Hypopyon and Lipid Flare in Cats

Hypopyon is the accumulation of white blood cells in the front (anterior) chamber of the eye. An inflammatory breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier allows for entry of blood cells into this chamber; chemoattractants, chemical substances that influence the migration of cells, can act as a conveyor for this cellular movement. The cells often settle in place because of gravity, forming a fluid line in the lower front chamber of the eye.

Lipid flare, on the other hand, resembles hypopyon, but the clouded appearance of the anterior chamber is caused by a high concentration of lipids (the fatty substance in the cells) in the aqueous humor (the thick watery substance between the eye's lens and cornea). It requires a breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and concurrent hyperlipidemia (an elevation of lipids in the blood stream) to occur. There is no age, gender or breed predilection.

Symptoms

Hypopyon

    White to yellow opacity within the anterior chamber
    May be an accumulation of cells in the lower area, or it may completely fill the anterior chamber
    Concurrent ophthalmic signs can include:
    
        Blepharospasm (twitching of the eye)
        Epiphora (excessive tear production)
        Diffuse corneal swelling
        Aqueous flare
        Miosis (constriction of the pupil of the eye)
        Swelling of the iris
        Vision loss/blindness
    
    


Lipid flare

    Diffuse milky appearance of the anterior chamber
    Usually obscures visualization of structures within the eye
    Concurrent ophthalmic signs may include:
    
        Vision loss
        Mild blepharospasm (twitching)
        Mild to moderate diffuse corneal swelling
    
    

 
Causes

Hypopyon
Any underlying condition which causes uveitis – inflammation of the middle layer of the eye – can result in hypopyon. Most commonly, hypopyon is associated with severe forms of uveitis, but hypopyon can also result from tumor cell accumulation in cases that involve ocular lymphoma (eye tumors).

Lipid Flare
Lipid flare often results from a condition of hyperlipidemia (raised or abnormal levels of lipids – the fatty substance of the bloodstream – in the blood stream), and concurrent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier (due to uveitis). Hyperlipidemia may also destabilize the blood-aqueous barrier directly. High levels of lipids in the circulating blood following a meal (postprandial lipemia) may occasionally result in the appearance of lipemic aqueous if uveitis is present.



Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ocular examination on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition.

Hypopyon may be diagnosed by the presence of fibrin (the protein end product of coagulated blood) in the anterior chamber – generally forms an irregular clot, not a ventrally located horizontal line.
Lipid flare will need to be differentiated from severe aqueous flare, which does not appear as milky/white as lipid flare. Animals that are affected with severe aqueous flare generally exhibit much more ocular pain than animals with lipid flare.

Diffuse corneal edema, a severe corneal edema, may be confused with anterior chamber opacity, but corneal stromal (connective tissue) thickening, keratoconus (degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye), and corneal bullae (fluid-filled blister) are more typically noted with diffuse corneal edema than with hypopyon or lipid flare.

Treatment

Hypopyon requires aggressive treatment for the uveitis and its underlying cause. Outpatient treatment is generally adequate, but you will need to be aware that there is still a significant chance that your cat will lose its sight. Lipid flare requires treatment for the uveitis, which is usually mild, and any underlying metabolic disorders. If your cat is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, you will need to change the cat's diet to one that is lower in fat and calories, in order to decrease the amount of fat in the bloodstream. Outpatient treatment, with anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed for home administration, is generally adequate.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule a check-up for two to three days after the initial treatment. Intraocular (within the eyes) pressure should be monitored to detect secondary glaucoma. The frequency of subsequent rechecks will be dictated by the severity of the disease and your cat's individual response to treatment.

The expected prognosis may depend heavily on what the underlying condition is behind the eye condition. For example, with hypopyon, the prognosis is guarded depending on the underlying disease and response to treatment. With lipid flare, the prognosis is usually good. It generally responds quickly (within 24–72 hours) to moderate anti-inflammatory therapy. However, keep in mind that recurrence and the need for further treatment is possible with lipid flare.","

488,Excess Alkali in the Blood in Cats,"Metabolic Alkalosis in Cats

Metabolic alkalosis in cats occurs when higher than normal bicarbonate (HCO3) levels are found in the blood. Bicarbonate serves to maintain the delicate balance of acid and alkali in the blood, also known as the pH balance, which is chiefly maintained by the lungs and kidneys. Diseases affecting the kidney and gastrointestinal tract functions are usually involved in the disruption of the acid and alkali balance in the blood. Though it must be pointed out that metabolic alkalosis is a secondary phenomenon and some other underlying disease is usually responsible for this problem. Metabolic alkalosis can occur in cats of any breed, age or gender.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms are generally related to the underlying cause of the metabolic alkalosis. The general symptoms related to metabolic alkalosis include:


    Weakness
    Irregular heartbeats
    Ileus (complete arrest of 	intestinal movements)
    Muscle twitching
    Dehydration
    Seizures (rare)


Causes


    Vomiting
    Oral administration of alkali, 	like bicarbonate
    Administration of drugs which 	increase urine outflow resulting in loss of more acid
    Hypoalbuminemia (decreased level 	of albumin - a protein in the blood)
    Diseases that affect secretion of 	bicarbonate through the kidneys, resulting in retention of more 	alkali than normally required


Diagnosis

After taking a complete history of your cat's health, including a time line of how and when the symptoms began, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination on your cat. The next step will be to perform laboratory testing to check the levels of acid and alkali in the different body fluids. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood gas analysis is also very useful in the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis. The laboratory testing usually provides sufficient information for your veterinarian to be able to confirm a diagnosis.

  

Treatment

Metabolic alkalosis does not occur independently, but as a result of an underlying cause that is responsible for the increase of alkali in the blood. Therefore, treatment of the underlying cause is of primary importance in correcting and further preventing complications of the metabolic alkalosis. In cats of severe, life-threatening metabolic alkalosis, emergency treatment is usually required. Drugs which may aggravate already existing metabolic alkalosis will be stopped. If there is vomiting, this will need to be treated, as it is one of the major factors in the development of metabolic alkalosis. Laboratory testing may need to be repeated to ensure that a complete recovery has been achieved, or whether further treatment is still required.

Living and Management

After returning from hospital, observe your cat closely for a few days. If vomiting should start again, or any other abnormality is observed, call your veterinarian immediately."," and Types

"
489,Excess Acidity in the Blood of Cats,"Renal Tubular Acidosis in Cats

Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a rare syndrome that causes the kidney to be unable to excrete acid through the urine, leading to extreme acidity of the cat's blood. Cats with RTA will also have abnormal levels of potassium in the blood. This condition occurs as a part of the metabolic process, by which food is transformed into energy.

Although RTA is seen in both cats and dogs, it rarely occurs in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types

Some common symptoms which may be observed include:


    Fever
    Panting
    Anorexia
    Lethargy
    Weight loss
    Dehydration
    Muscle weakness
    Bloody urine (hematuria)
    Excessive thirst (polydipsia)
    Frequent urination (polyuria)
    Difficulty urinating (due to bladder stones)


There are two primary RTA types: type 1 RTA (or distal), involves reduced hydrogen ion secretion in the kidney, and type 2 RTA (or proximal), which is characterized by the inability to excrete acid into the urine. Abnormal metabolic processing of bicarbonates is referred to as metabolic acidosis, and is marked by abnormally high levels of acids in the blood, and abnormally low levels of acids in the urine.

Type 2 proximal RTA occurs because of reduced bicarbonate reabsorption from the kidney. This activity causes an imbalance of acids in the blood.


Causes

Some of the common underlying causes of RTA include infection of the kidney and ureter(s), and feline hepatic lipidosis, a type of liver disease. However, there are times when the RTA is idiopathic.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.  Your veterinarian will use the results of the blood work to rule out or confirm an underlying systemic disease. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.



The results from a blood gases analysis, along with the results of the electrolyte panel, should indicate a normal anion gap (sum of the cations minus the anions in the plasma) with metabolic acidosis, indicating that the alkaline urine is abnormal. This is a key diagnostic feature of type 1 RTA.

Treatment

Your cat will be hospitalized until it no longer shows metabolic acidosis or low potassium levels. There they will be given potassium citrate and sodium citrate  (sometimes replaced with sodium bicarbonate) until the metabolic acidosis and low potassium levels normalize. Potassium gluconate may also be given to cats with low potassium levels.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor any underlying disease your cat may have, and to follow your pet's progress. Cats without an underlying disease have a good prognosis for recovery when the condition has been treated appropriately and effectively."," and Types

490,Ethanol Poisoning in Cats,"Ethanol Toxicosis in Cats



Exposure to ethanol, either orally or through the skin, is a common source of toxicity in household pets. Depression of the central nervous system is typical of ethanol poisoning -- expressed as drowsiness, lack of coordination or loss of consciousness. Other effects may include damage to body cells, and symptoms such as incontinence, slowed heart rate, and even heart attack.



Ethanol poisoning in cats can occur as a result of exposure to dyes, inks, disinfectants, mouthwashes, paints, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, gasoline, and certain beverages.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms will vary depending on the amount of ethanol ingested, and whether your cat's stomach was full or empty. The main symptom is a depressed central nervous system, which may develop 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion on an empty stomach, and up to two hours when ingested on a full stomach.



Other symptoms include urinating or defecating involuntarily. Higher doses of ethanol ingestion can bring about behavioral changes ranging from depression to excitement, decreased body temperature (hypothermia), slow reflexes, and flatulence if bread dough is the source of ethanol (see causes, below). Signs of advanced ethanol poisoning include depression, slowed breathing and heart rate, an increase in total body acid (metabolic acidosis), and heart attack. If left untreated, this can result in your cat's death.



Symptoms of ethanol poisoning may also be similar to early stages of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning.



Causes



Ethanol poisoning can occur from the ingestion of a variety of products. Fermented products such as bread dough and rotten apples, food that a cat can easily find while digging through the garbage, is one source of toxicity. Poisoning can also occur when beverages, commercial products, or medications containing alcohol are spilled and lapped up by an animal. A toxic reaction from exposure to alcohol-containing products through the skin is also possible.





Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will be able to conclusively diagnose ethanol poisoning via blood tests that measure blood-ethanol concentrations in your cat's bloodstream. A urine test for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may also point to ethanol poisoning, as well as a pH test for measuring heightened levels of acid in the body.





Treatment



Depending on the severity of symptoms displayed, treatment for ethanol poisoning varies. Intravenous (IV) fluids should be provided for dehydration, and medication may be administered to alleviate central nervous system depression, as well as to inhibit the metabolism of alcohol.



In more severe cases, if your cat is having respiratory problems, artificial ventilation to aid breathing, such as with an oxygen mask, may be necessary. If a heart attack has occurred, cardiac therapy should be attended to first.



Living and Management



Symptoms should subside within eight to twelve hours if the initial treatment is successful. Your veterinarian will follow up the initial treatment with blood and urine pH measurements, and will check for evidence of abnormally high body acidity until the danger has passed.



Prevention



The only way to prevent ethanol poisoning is to make sure that your cat is not exposed to ethanol containing products such as paint, perfume, mouthwash, fermented foods, and other products containing ethanol. All ethanol containing products should be kept out of your cat's reach – preferably in locked cabinets or secure containers."," and Types

491,Estrus Symptoms after Spaying in Cats,"Ovarian Remnant Syndrome in Cats



An ovariohysterectomy is a surgical procedure in which the uterus and ovaries are removed from a female cat. Such a removal results in the cessation of subsequent estrus (heat) symptoms in the female. However, some female cats continue to exhibit the behavioral and/or physical signs pertaining to estrus even after such a surgery, and are found to have some ovarian tissue that had not been removed during surgery and was left behind. If such tissue remains functional and continues to secrete hormones, estrus behavior will continue. Such symptoms are typically seen within few days after surgery.



Symptoms and Types




	Excessive vocalization
	Signs of heat (e.g., elevation of pelvis to facilitate intercourse [lordosis])
	Restlessness
	Head rubbing
	Rolling around
	Deviation of tail
	Swelling of the vulva
	May allow sexual intercourse to take place




Causes




	Failure to remove both ovaries completely during surgery
	Presence of abnormal ovarian tissue
	Supernumerary ovary (excessive number of ovaries - rare)




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough medical history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and of course, whether and when your cat had the ovariohysterectomy. The history will usually include behavioral changes and signs of estrus that have taken place even after a successful surgical removal of the ovaries and uterus. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Standard laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. It is not unusual for the results of these tests to return within normal ranges.



More specific tests for measuring your cat's hormones may show estrogen and progesterone levels that are higher than should be expected in a post-surgery cat. A cytological examination of samples taken from the vagina will also help in determining the status of estrus in your cat. In addition, ultrasound can be used to determine whether any ovarian tissue residues are present. However, in some cases abdominal surgery may be required to confirm the presence of ovarian tissue. If this is found to be the case, removal of these residual tissues can take place at that time.







Treatment



After reaching a confirmatory diagnosis, your veterinarian will consult with you about a second round of surgery to remove any left-over functioning ovarian tissue.



Living and Management



Prognosis is very good after the removal of ovarian tissue residues has been performed. All abnormal symptoms should resolve soon after surgery.



Patients undergoing an ovariohysterectomy or follow-up surgery to remove remaining tissue will need painkillers for a few days after surgery. Preventive antibiotics are also used for some patients to prevent infection. Give medications as prescribed and follow the guidelines for proper nutrition and medication. Do not give any additional medications or supplements to your cat without first consulting your veterinarian.

492,Epilepsy in Cats,"What Is Epilepsy in Cats?
Epilepsy is a neurologic medical condition that is defined by a cat having two or more unprovoked seizures. If your cat has only had one seizure, it is considered an isolated incident and they are not considered to have epilepsy.

Types of Epilepsy in Cats

Seizures in cats come from an abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

Idiopathic epilepsy is a hereditary disorder of the brain that occurs for an unknown reason. Idiopathic, or primary, epilepsy is the diagnosis made in cats when there is no structural cause for the seizures but there is abnormal electrical activity.

Symptomatic epilepsy involves seizures where structural changes to the brain are seen on advanced imaging, such as an MRI. Idiopathic epilepsy is common in dogs and is rare in cats, but is certainly a possible diagnosis if your cat develops seizures. While still rare, cats are more likely to have structural changes, therefore most epilepsy in cats is classified as symptomatic.

Depending on the underlying cause of epilepsy in cats, seizures can start at anytime in life, young or old. No matter if your cat has had one or many seizures, contact your veterinarian for guidance, as your cat will likely need an examination.

What is the Difference Between a Seizure and Epilepsy in Cats?

Seizures in cats are caused by a sudden surge in electrical activity of the brain that causes symptoms such as tremors and convulsing. Epilepsy is the term used to describe a neurologic medical condition in which a cat has repeated seizures—two or more.

Epilepsy can be characterized by having one seizure at a time or multiple clusters, and they can occur regularly or unexpectedly. It is often a symptom of a disease process within the brain, but in cats, seizures are often from an unknown cause.

Symptoms of Epilepsy in Cats
Epilepsy is associated with three stages when a cat is having a seizure. The symptoms of each stage can be very different.

Pre-ictal phase—aura; characterized by a behavior change before seizure occurs:


	
	Hiding
	
	
	Attention-seeking
	
	
	Licking lips
	
	
	Head turning unusually
	


Ictal phase—active seizure activity

Generalized seizure also called gran mal seizure (similar to a human’s gran mal seizure) and often lasts one to two minutes. It affects the entire body and usually causes cats to be unaware of their surroundings or even lose consciousness:


	
	Partial or complete collapse
	
	
	Jerky movements
	
	
	Convulsing
	
	
	Stiff limbs with joints locked
	
	
	Paddling or running movements of the legs and arms
	
	
	Urination and/or defecation
	
	
	Excessive salivation or foaming at the mouth
	
	
	Disorientation
	
	
	Often, but not always, the head is tilted backward
	
	
	Status epilepticus in particular is a type of generalized seizure that lasts more than 5–10 minutes. This is a true medical emergency and requires emergency treatment
	


Partial or focal seizure­—Abnormal movement localized in one area of the body; cat is often fully awake and aware of its surroundings:


	
	Strange, uncharacteristic behavior
	
	
	Unusual vocalization
	
	
	Drooling
	
	
	Twitching
	
	
	Abnormal body posture
	
	
	Chewing movements
	


 Post-ictal—change in behavior after seizure occurs; period of time before cat acts “normal” again:


	
	Disorientation
	
	
	Pacing
	
	
	Lethargic
	
	
	Not wanting to eat
	


Causes of Epilepsy in Cats
Epilepsy is more common in cats younger than 8 years old, but it can happen at any age. Any disease that involves the brain directly or affects other body systems, such as the liver or kidneys, can cause seizures.

Intracranial causes of seizures come from within the brain itself, while extracranial causes are outside of the brain. Seizures in cats can occur at any time, but they often occur when there are changes to brain activity such as falling asleep, waking up, excitement, feeding time, or another change in activity.

Idiopathic or primary epilepsy


	Unknown cause—no structural change in the brain—only a change in function of brain activity. It is seen primarily in cats that are considered young adults (between 1-6 years of age)


Intracranial epilepsy


	
	Brain tumors
	
	
	Inflammation of the brain (meningitis)
	
	
	Head trauma such as traffic accidents, skull fractures, cat bites
	
	
	Brain parasites such as toxoplasmosis
	
	
	Brain infection such as encephalitis
	
	
	Brain anomalies such as hydrocephalus
	


Extracranial epilepsy


	
	Inner or middle ear infections
	
	
	Toxin exposure (may cause epilepsy but often only causes one seizure)

	
		
		Exposure to flea and tick medications formulated for dogs
		
		
		Ingestion of human medications, ethylene glycol (antifreeze), or rat poison
		
	
	
	
	FIP and FeLV
	
	
	Metabolic anomalies such as portosystemic shunt (PSS), low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), low blood sodium (hyponatremia), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), or thiamine deficiency
	
	
	Diabetes
	
	
	Liver or kidney disease
	
	
	High blood pressure
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Epilepsy in Cats
A diagnosis of epilepsy is made when your cat has two or more seizure episodes. While the actual act of having a seizure can be diagnosed visibly, the underlying cause requires diagnostics testing. If you suspect your cat is having a seizure, one of the most helpful tools for your veterinarian is taking a video of the behavior.

Full bloodwork and urine testing is needed to evaluate your cat’s blood sugar, along with bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Specialized blood tests for infectious diseases such as FIV, FeLV and toxoplasmosis are often done as well. X-rays are taken to look at the structure of the skull and other internal organs, but the most common tests done on cats with a suspected epilepsy diagnosis are CT scans or MRIs. These imaging techniques are usually done with a veterinary internal medicine specialist or a veterinary neurologist. which your primary veterinarian can refer you to after epilepsy is diagnosed. While your cat is under anesthesia for a CT scan or MRI, your veterinarian will often take samples of spinal fluid for infectious disease testing and look for signs of inflammation. Intracranial causes of epilepsy do require a CT or MRI to be confirmed.

The goal of the diagnostic testing is to find the underlying condition, so that a specific treatment plan can be made for your cat to help reduce or eliminate further seizures from occurring.

Depending on the severity of your cat’s epilepsy, your veterinarian will determine how aggressively they will need to search for a definitive diagnosis.

Treatment of Epilepsy in Cats
While a single seizure episode may be curable, epilepsy is often about managing the disease, unless the cause of the seizure is found and eliminated.

Treating epilepsy can often be very complicated, involving multiple medications or only one, as each cat responds differently to treatment.

Diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer must be treated to try to avoid additional seizures. Anti-convulsant medications are the foundation of epilepsy treatment in cats.

Common anti-convulsant medications for cats include phenobarbital, potassium bromide, levetiracetam (Keppra), and zonisamide. Most medications, especially if they work well to control the seizures, are lifelong. Cats with severe illness associated with their epilepsy will often have to be hospitalized on IV fluids and started on injectable anti-convulsant medications. Depending upon your  cat’s diagnosis, a special diet may be required, although cats can typically remain on their normal diet.

Recovery and Management of Epilepsy in Cats
Cats with epilepsy and on anti-convulsant medications are monitored closely with consistent, routine blood testing to check for therapeutic blood levels. Some of the medications, especially phenobarbital, can have toxic effects on your cat at certain levels, so frequent monitoring of the blood levels is very important.

Monitoring also lets your vet know if the levels are too low and your cat is having more frequent seizures, so the dose of the medication can be increased. It also indicates if an additional medication is needed to help control the seizures.

Always give all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian. Even if you think a medication is not helping your cat, do not stop giving it without your veterinarian’s approval, as this can be just as dangerous as the seizures itself. Without medication, sudden withdrawal can lead to uncontrollable seizures. It is also very important to stick to the dosing schedule for seizure medications.  

In cats with epilepsy, the goal is to maintain a good quality of life. The seizures will not completely go away, but will hopefully be reduced in frequency and severity. Even if your cat still has occasional seizures, they can live a long, healthy life, depending on the underlying cause of the epilepsy.

493,Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex in Cats,"Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex in Cats

Eosinophilic granuloma complex in cats often is a confusing term for three distinct syndromes that cause inflammation of the skin:


	Eosinophilic plaque - circumscribed, raised, round to oval lesions that frequently are ulcerated. They are usually located on the abdomen or thighs. These lesions contain a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil.
	Eosinophilic granuloma - a mass or nodular lesion containing eosinophils usually found on the back of the thighs, on the face, or in the mouth.
	Indolent ulcer – circumscribed, ulcerated lesions most frequently found on the upper lip.


The three syndromes are grouped together as eosinophilic granuloma complex, primarily according to their clinical similarities, their frequent simultaneous development, and their positive response to the same treatment with steroids.

Eosinophilic refers to eosinophils, a type of white-blood cell usually involved in allergic responses. Granuloma is a large inflammatory nodule or solid mass. And a complex is a group of signs or diseases that have an identifiable characteristic that makes them similar in some fashion.

The genetics are unknown, although several reports of related affected individuals and a study of disease development in a colony of cats indicate that in at least some individuals, genetic susceptibility (perhaps resulting in an inheritable dysfunction of eosinophils) is a significant component of the disease.

Specifically, eosinophilic granuloma complex is restricted to cats. While eosinophilic granulomas do occur in dogs and other species, they are not considered part of the eosinophilic granuloma complex. Breed does not appear to play a role in cats.

Eosinophilic plaque is circumscribed, raised, round-to-oval lesions that frequently are ulcerated and usually appear on the abdomen or thighs. The lesions contain a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil and usually affect cats in the two to six year age range. Genetically initiated eosinophilic granuloma is generally seen in cats that are younger than two years of age.

Allergic disorders usually develop after a cat has reached the age of two. In cats, females may be more likely to develop one or more of the syndromes of eosinophilic granuloma complex than are males.

Symptoms and Types

Lesions of more than one syndrome may occur simultaneously. Lesions of all three syndromes may develop spontaneously and suddenly.

 

Eosinophilic plaques:


	Circumscribed, raised, round to oval lesions frequently ulcerated
	Moist or glistening plaques (may have enlarged lymph nodes)
	Abdomen
	Near the chest
	Inner thigh area
	Near the anus
	Under front legs
	Hair loss
	Red skin
	Erosions


Eosinophilic granulomas:


	Linear orientation
	Back of the thigh
	Multiple lesions coming together
	Coarse, cobblestone pattern
	White or yellow
	Lip or chin swelling (edema)
	Footpad swelling
	Pain
	Lameness


Indolent ulcer:


	Ulcers of the mouth
	Found on upper lip
	Within the oral cavity, ulcers on gums
	Slightly raised margins
	Non-bleeding
	Usually painless
	May transform into a more malignant cancerous form (carcinoma)


Causes


	Non-specific allergies
	Allergic hypersensitivity reaction
	Food allergy
	Fleas
	Insects
	Genetic predisposition


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as an allergic reaction or flea infestation. Any information you have about your cat's genetic background may also be helpful in diagnosing this disorder. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis as part of the diagnostic process.

The physical exam should include a dermatologic exam, during which skin biopsies for a histopathology study will be taken. Skin scrapings will also be examined microscopically and cultured for the presence of bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. Impression smears of the lesions should also be taken.

 

Treatment

Most cats may be treated on an outpatient basis unless the condition is severe and is causing your cat severe discomfort.

A food-elimination trial should be started for all cases in case it is a simple allergy. A diet which the cat has never been exposed to should be put in place using high protein meats, like lamb, pork, venison, or rabbit, exclusively for 8–10 weeks. After this time, reinstitute the previous diet and observe your cat for development of new lesions.

An environmental allergy (atopy) may be identified by intradermal skin testing in some cases. Your veterinarian will inject small amounts of dilute allergens intradermally (between layers of skin). A positive reaction (allergy) is indicated by the development of a hive or wheal at the injection site.

Your veterinarian will recommend and prescribe anti-inflammatory medications for immediate relief from the swelling and inflammation. Hyposensitization injections, which use minute amounts of the allergen to lessen sensitivity to the allergen in question, works for most cats and is preferable to long-term steroid administration.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you in order to determine your cat's response to the food-elimination trial, and to monitor your cat's bloodwork. The results from the bloodwork is especially important if your cat has been prescribed immunosuppressive medication - as this will lower your cat's immune responsiveness to viruses and infections.

As much as possible, follow your veterinarian's recommendations regarding the dietary guidelines for your cat. The treatment plan will be adjusted at each follow-up appointment according to your cat's progress. If your veterinarian is able to determine an environmental cause of the allergy you will need to prevent your cat from being exposed to these allergens."," and Types

What is Entropion in Cats?
Entropion is an abnormal inward rolling of the upper or lower eyelids, causing abnormal, painful friction with the surface of the eye. Entropion is especially irritating to the cornea, or the curved, clear part of the eye. Lower eyelid entropion is most common, and usually occurs toward the outside edge of the eye. The abnormal rolling of the eyelid may introduce hair directly onto the cornea and conjunctiva, causing scratches, ulcers, inflammation, discharge and pain.

Any cat can have entropion; however short-nosed breeds, such as Himalayan and Persian cats, have an increased likelihood for the condition.

Symptoms of Entropion in Cats
Entropion signs vary depending on severity. Most commonly, cats display:


	
	Squinting
	
	
	Eye discharge
	
	
	Rubbing the eye
	
	
	Nasal discharge
	
	
	Swollen eyelids
	
	
	Red eyes
	
	
	Eyelid spasms
	
	
	Raised third eyelid
	
	
	Conjunctivitis
	
	
	Cloudy cornea and ulceration
	


Causes of Entropion in Cats
There are three main causes of entropion in cats:

Congenital Entropion

Congenital means “present at birth,” and is usually noticed around two weeks of age, when the eyes open for the first time. This is an uncommon form of entropion in cats.

Anatomical/Developmental Entropion

Anatomical, or developmental entropion, is also rare in cats. This type occurs more often with brachycephalic, or short-nosed breeds, and purebred Himalayan or Persians. In these breeds, the eyes bulge more secondary to a shallow eye socket, causing crowding in the face and subsequent inversion of the eyelid. Researchers have also found this type of entropion in cats with a special hyper-elastic connective tissue condition, called Ehlers-Danlos, in which the tissue stretches abnormally. Anatomical entropion typically affects both eyes.

Acquired Entropion

There are three general types of acquired, or secondary, entropion in cats.


	Spastic entropion is the most common type of entropion in cats. This type is secondary to any other painful eye (ocular) disease, such as corneal ulcers, eye pain, or dry eye, that cause involuntary ocular muscle spasms and subsequent inward rolling of the eyelid.

	

	The eye’s anatomy is initially normal, but chronic irritation, especially from feline herpesvirus-1, causes damage that is sometimes permanent. Most often, spastic entropion involves only one eye, but it can involve both.

	 
	Cicatricial entropion is uncommon in cats and happens when the eyelid is damaged or swollen causing an abnormal rubbing of the eye.

	 
	Involutional entropion occurs most often in senior cats and involves the loss of the fat pad behind the eye. The loss of fat causes the eye to sink inwards and allows the lid to roll.


 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Entropion in Cats
Diagnosing entropion in cats is typically straightforward when eyelid hairs are rubbing the surface of the eye.  However, some cases can be more challenging. Many cats, especially those who are in pain, may close or squint their eyes. This leads to intermittent or difficult-to-see entropion. Veterinarians may use a variety of tests to identify entropion and secondary eye issues, including:


	
	Topical anesthetics: Especially with spastic entropion, numbing the surface of the eye may provide enough relief to allow the eyelid to roll back to a normal position. This is only used for diagnosis. The underlying condition must be identified to resolve the issue.
	
	
	Fluorescein stain test: Veterinarians may also perform a fluorescein stain test to look for corneal ulcers. A corneal ulcer will reflect light back, and the stain makes an ulcer glow bright green under a black light.
	
	
	Intraocular pressure test: The vet may also use an intraocular pressure test to look for inflammation or glaucoma as a reason for the entropion, or as a secondary side effect.
	
	Schirmer tear test: Veterinarians may perform a Schirmer tear test to quantify tear production. Low tear production could be the reason for pain, inflammation and irritation, leading to entropion. 


Treatment of Entropion in Cats
Treating entropion in cats depends on the cause for the condition. In most cases of spastic entropion, the underlying disease process must first be identified and corrected. These cats will most commonly be treated for conjunctivitis using a variety of the following medications: 


	
	Topical and/or oral or injectable antibiotics
	
	
	Topical and/or oral or injectable pain medications
	
	
	Artificial tears
	
	
	Topical or systemic antivirals
	


Occasionally, cats with spastic entropion may need a temporary procedure called tacking that involves using sutures to keep the eyelid from rolling onto the eye during the healing process.

Eyelid Surgery

Some cats with entropion require surgical correction and typically have an excellent success rate. A veterinary surgeon removes a small elliptical wedge of skin and fur near the eyelid margin. By removing a wedge of tissue, the eyelid flips down into a normal position and no longer rolls onto the eye. Some general practitioners may feel comfortable performing this procedure, but veterinary ophthalmologists may have more experience.

Cost of Entropion Surgery for Cats

Entropion surgery may cost less than $1,000, depending on the veterinarian’s location and experience level, and if the entropion involves one or both eyes. More complicated cases and surgery done by veterinary ophthalmologists may cost several times that amount. 

Hyaluronic Acid Injection

Veterinarians use Hyaluronic Acid (HA) injections as an alternative to surgery, especially in older felines that do not tolerate anesthesia well. HA is a filler-type material that allows the eyelid to be successfully turned outward. This is typically a safe and easy method in more mild cases of entropion. However, the success rate is lower - compared to surgical correction - and may require additional follow-ups and procedures.

Recovery and Management of Entropion in Cats
Cats generally recover well from entropion. For cats that required surgical correction, follow-up appointments are necessary, usually within 10-14 days after surgery. Suture material may be present and will be removed by the veterinarian, although some vets may prefer to use absorbable suture material instead.

During the healing process, the incision area may be red and inflamed with minimal discharge. Cats will need to wear an Elizabethan collar to prevent self-traumatizing the eye or incision. Cats may recover with topical eye medications, as well as oral medications to treat pain, inflammation and to prevent infection.

 Contact a veterinarian if your cat shows the following signs after surgery:


	
	Pus-like discharge from the incision or eye
	
	
	New or worsening redness or swelling around the incision and eye
	
	
	New or worsening squinting
	
	
	New or worsening cloudiness to the surface of the eye
	
	
	Decreased or no appetite
	


Some cats will have permanent corneal scarring and conjunctivitis even after correction of the entropion and may require life-long medications to maintain eye comfort and health. Optixcare (eye lube plus) is a great general eye lubricating gel that helps soothe and keep the eye moist.

Brachycephalic breeds may benefit from continued lubrication and may help decrease occurrences of entropion in the future. Because most cases of entropion are spastic, it is important to monitor your cat’s eyes closely and seek veterinary treatment quickly. Early intervention offers the best chance of success and return the eye to normal function.

495,Enlarged Spleen in Cats,"What Is an Enlarged Spleen in Cats?
The medical term for an enlarged spleen in cats is feline splenomegaly. If your cat’s spleen is very large, their belly may have a bloated appearance. Otherwise, you commonly can’t tell from looking at your cat that they have an enlarged spleen in their abdomen.

This can happen due to masses or nodules in the spleen, inflammation of the spleen, or a backup of blood into the spleen (congestion). Some, but not all, causes of splenic enlargement may cause pain or discomfort. A significant increase in size can put pressure on surrounding organs.

While mild cases of splenic enlargement might occur relatively frequently, splenomegaly is not a very common medical problem in cats.

If your cat is pale, collapsing, repeatedly vomiting, or yowling when their abdomen is touched, seek emergency care. Splenic enlargement is one of many possible causes of these emergency symptoms.

Symptoms of an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
The symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats aren’t specific to the condition. This means they could indicate a whole host of different things, and splenomegaly based on these symptoms alone is not enough for a diagnosis.

 Symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats include:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Bloated abdomen
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Vomiting or diarrhea
	


Splenomegaly often occurs secondary to another condition, such as an infection. In these cases, your cat may have other symptoms that depend on the underlying cause.

For example, a cat with an infectious cause might also have a fever, and a cat with an autoimmune cause like immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) might also have pale or jaundiced gums.

Causes of an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
Causes of enlarged spleen in cats can include:


	
	Cancers such as mast cell tumors or leukemia (which occur secondary to feline leukemia virus)
	
	
	Infections such as cytauxzoonosis, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), histoplasmosis, or hemotropic mycoplasmosis
	
	
	Congestion (blood backing up into the spleen) due to sedatives or right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF)
	
	
	Nodular hypoplasia (sometimes occurs as a normal aging change)
	
	
	Extramedullary hematopoiesis (bone marrow isn’t working well so the spleen makes red blood cells)
	
	
	Splenic hematomas (solid swelling of clotted blood)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
A veterinarian might be able to feel an enlarged spleen in cats when they palpate (examine by touch) the abdomen.

X-rays of the abdomen can also show an enlarged spleen. Ultrasonography of the abdomen allows for more detailed examination and can identify things like splenic masses, changes to the spleen’s architecture, or fluid in the abdomen that might be related to splenomegaly.

Your veterinarian may recommend a procedure called a fine needle aspirate (FNA), which is the collection of a sample of cells acquired by putting a needle into the spleen and suctioning cells into the syringe. The cells are placed on a lab and examined under a microscope, often at a specialty lab. If your veterinarian recommends a splenic FNA, your cat will need to be sedated to prevent accidental laceration of the spleen, which could result in significant internal bleeding.

Treatment of an Enlarged Spleen in Cats
Treatment of enlarged spleen in cats varies depending on the cause of splenomegaly. Some cases do not require treatment, such as splenic enlargement that occurs after administering sedatives.

In some cases, such as a bleeding splenic hematoma, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is an effective and curative treatment. If significant blood loss was associated with the splenic hematoma, the cat may also require a blood transfusion.

Some infectious causes may be treated with antifungals or antibiotics. Other infectious causes of an enlarged spleen have a very poor prognosis, although some have a better outlook with early and aggressive treatment.

With cancerous causes, treatment options include removal of the spleen (if the tumor is only in the spleen) and chemotherapy. Most malignancies affecting the spleen do not have a favorable long-term prognosis, but treatment can provide relief and prolong life.

If your cat’s splenomegaly is secondary to cancer, they may be referred to a veterinary oncologist for specialized care.

Recovery for an enlarged spleen in cats depends on why your cat’s spleen was enlarged. Some cases don’t affect their health and they can recover on their own.

If your cat has an infectious cause, they may be hospitalized for several days. A lot of the infectious causes of enlarged spleen require prolonged administration of medications. For example, treatment for histoplasmosis involves administering antifungal medications for several months. You will have more frequent check-ins with the veterinarian to monitor progress.

If your cat had surgery, you’ll want to keep them from licking their incision. Recovery cones, e-collars, or recovery suits may be a good option.

Follow your veterinarian’s instructions for post-operative activity restrictions.

Prevention of Enlarged Spleen in Cats
Some causes of enlarged spleen in cats aren’t preventable. However, you can reduce the risk of infectious diseases that cause splenic enlargement by vaccinating your cat against feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and staying up to date on flea, tick, and heartworm preventives.

Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding frequency of wellness exams. Your veterinarian may be able to detect conditions before they develop symptoms. Early detection means earlier intervention, which can slow the progression of chronic diseases.

The symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats aren’t specific to the condition. This means they could indicate a whole host of different things, and splenomegaly based on these symptoms alone is not enough for a diagnosis.

 Symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats include:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Bloated abdomen
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Vomiting or diarrhea
	


Splenomegaly often occurs secondary to another condition, such as an infection. In these cases, your cat may have other symptoms that depend on the underlying cause.

For example, a cat with an infectious cause might also have a fever, and a cat with an autoimmune cause like immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) might also have pale or jaundiced gums.

496,Enlarged Liver in Cats,"Hepatomegaly in Cats



Due to certain diseases and conditions that can either directly or indirectly affect the liver's ability to function, the organ may increase in size, which is referred to as hepatomegaly.



Symptoms and Types



Kittens normally have larger livers in regard to their actual body mass, as compared to adult cats. However, hepatomegaly is most commonly diagnosed in older cats. Depending on the underlying cause, the enlargement may involve the whole liver or only part of the liver. For example, infections and/or inflammation may lead to a generalized symmetrical enlargement of the liver, whereas tumors, hemorrhages, cysts, or rotation of the liver lobe may lead to asymmetrical or focal enlargement. That is, only a part of the liver may be enlarged.



Symptoms can vary depending on the cause. Enlargement of the abdomen is the most commonly observed symptom. On examination your veterinarian will find an enlarged liver or a palpable mass in the abdominal area. The mass is usually observed behind the rib cage and may even be visible with naked eye. However, in obese animals it is difficult to detect an enlarged liver on physical examination.



Causes




	Extra blood pooling near the liver
	Hepatitis (liver infection)
	Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis)
	Obstruction in blood flow passing through the liver
	Heart disease and failure
	Liver neoplasia
	Heartworm disease
	Rotation of the liver lobe around its axis
	Diaphragmatic hernia (hernia resulting from the protrusion of part of the stomach through the diaphragm)
	Abnormal deposition of metabolic products within the liver tissue
	Accumulation of fat in the liver tissue
	Tumor involving the pancreas
	Liver abscess
	Liver cyst
	Drug toxicity




Diagnosis



You will need to give a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems, and a complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the routine laboratory tests are highly variable depending on the underlying cause of the liver enlargement. The complete blood count may reveal anemia, abnormal spherical red blood cells (spherocytes), disrupted red blood cells (schistocytes), red blood cells with spots due to hemoglobin accumulation (Heinz bodies), presence of parasites with red blood cells, immature white blood cells (blast cells) in the blood, red blood cells with nucleus, and abnormally low or high number of platelets (tiny cells used in blood clotting). The biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, and a high cholesterol level. Further testing may include blood clotting profile as blood clotting abnormalities are common in patients with liver involvement. Your cat may also be tested for presence of heartworm disease.



The abdominal X-rays may show an enlarged liver with rounded margins, or a displaced stomach and kidneys. The chest X-rays may help in determining any metastasis of a tumor to the chest cavity, and will also show diseases involving the heart and lungs. Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to view further details in the abdominal cavity, revealing changes in liver size and surface contour, as well as the presence of concurrent diseases. Abdominal ultrasound will also help in discriminating diffuse or localized types of liver enlargement. More advanced diagnostic tests, like electrocardiography and echocardiography, can be used to evaluate the structure and functions of heart.



If tumors are seen or suspected, your veterinarian will want to take a sample of liver tissue in order to confirm either its benign or malignant nature, but even without a tumor present, a tissue sample can be helpful for determining the cause, severity and stage of the liver disease. The samples will be sent to laboratory for microbial cultures, and in case of infection, the culturing of the sample will help in determining the type of microorganism that is involved so that suitable drugs can be prescribed. 









Treatment



Treatment is highly variable and will depend on the underlying cause. In case of heart involvement or advanced liver disease, your cat may need to be hospitalized for intensive treatment and supportive care. The aim of treatment is eliminate the inciting cause and prevent further complications. Broad spectrum antibiotics are given to the patients with infections. Dehydration is common in these patients and intravenous fluids are required for normalizing the fluid levels. Multivitamins are also given to maintain the healthy levels of vitamins. Some patients may also require surgical interventions to remove a tumor, abscess, or cyst.



Living and Management



Patients with heart failure or excessive fluid in the abdomen require changes in feed and fluid intake. These patients need special care and often complete cage rest is recommended. Special diet considerations, like addition of high levels of proteins, restriction of salt, and adequate vitamin supplementation will be put in place for your cat.



The prognosis is variable and depends on the underlying cause and duration of the disease. Some causes are less serious, while others are life-threatening in nature. As the liver is the central organ in the metabolism of drugs, you must not give any drug or change the dosage amount of any prescribed drugs without prior consultation with your veterinarian. In order to prevent negative energy balance, you will need to feed small and frequent meals to your cat. Your cat will need to be evaluated frequently during therapy. Your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing and radiography as necessary to monitor your cat's progress.

497,Enlarged Heart in Cats,"What Is an Enlarged Heart in Cats?
An enlarged heart in cats is typically caused by dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Although DCM occurs infrequently in cats, it causes a devastating outcome in most cases.

DCM causes the muscular part of the heart (myocardium) to become weak and unable to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. Blood builds up in the heart, causing the walls of the heart to become thinner and the heart chambers to become enlarged. Over time, congestive heart failure develops.

DCM most commonly affects the left side of the heart, causing fluid to build up in the lungs. As a result, affected cats typically show signs of respiratory distress, such as panting, increased respiratory rate, and coughing. In rare cases, right-sided heart enlargement may occur, which can lead to ascites, which is fluid in the abdomen.

DCM can cause significant discomfort for cats, especially as the disease worsens.

Cats in respiratory distress are considered to be experiencing a medical emergency and should be seen by a veterinarian immediately for treatment.

Symptoms of an Enlarged Heart in Cats
Symptoms of an enlarged heart in cats include:


	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Heart murmur
	
	
	Abnormal heart rhythm
	
	
	Weak pulse
	
	
	Decreased body temperature (hypothermia)
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Distended abdomen
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Collapse
	


Causes of an Enlarged Heart in Cats
Historically, an enlarged heart in cats was caused by a taurine deficiency. Taurine is an amino acid that is necessary for proper heart function in cats.

Today, commercial pet food companies supplement their diets with taurine. Because of this, taurine-responsive DCM is rare, except in cats fed homemade diets without the appropriate amount of taurine.

Rare cases of DCM have occurred in cats fed grain-free diets. Research to determine whether there is a correlation between the two is ongoing.

Most current cases of DCM in cats are idiopathic, which means they result from an unknown cause.

DCM is most common in middle-aged and older cats. The condition can affect all breeds, but Burmese, Abyssinian, and Siamese cats are diagnosed more frequently, most likely due to genetics. Male and female cats are equally likely to be affected.

How Veterinarians Diagnose an Enlarged Heart in Cats
Diagnosis of an enlarged heart in cats begins with a though physical exam. Your veterinarian will listen carefully to your cat’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope to identify a heart murmur, abnormal heart rhythm, or unusual lung sounds. Heart and respiratory rates will be noted.

Additional diagnostic tests that can be done include:


	
	Taurine levels—In cats fed a homemade or limited-ingredient diet, measuring taurine levels in the blood can help determine whether this nutritional deficiency is present.
	
	
	Electrocardiogram (EKG)—Electrodes are placed on a cat’s chest to track their heart rate and rhythm, which can be abnormal in cats with an enlarged heart. 
	
	
	Chest X-rays—Images of your cat’s chest may be taken to identify heart enlargement or fluid in the lungs.
	
	
	Echocardiogram—An ultrasound of the heart allows a veterinarian to visualize the heart in real time as it pumps. An echocardiogram is the preferred test to diagnose DCM and is performed by a veterinary cardiologist.
	


Treatment of an Enlarged Heart in Cats
An enlarged heart in cats is not curable, and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of heart failure. When cats are first diagnosed with this condition, they often need to be stabilized, which may involve the following treatments:


	
	Oxygen therapy—Supplemental oxygen can be administered to help cats breathe more easily.
	
	
	Thoracentesis—If your veterinarian suspects that fluid has built up in the chest, they may use a needle to drain the fluid.
	
	
	Diuretics—These medications can be given orally or by injection to remove excess fluid from the lungs and abdomen that has accumulated due to heart failure. Furosemide is the most common diuretic used for this purpose.
	
	
	Pimobendan—This medication is given orally to improve the heart’s pumping ability, so more blood is sent to the rest of the body.
	
	
	ACE inhibitors—These medications decrease blood pressure and help the heart pump blood more effectively. Examples include enalapril and benazepril. 
	
	
	Taurine—Although heart enlargement due to taurine deficiency is rare, some cats may benefit from taurine supplementation.  
	
	
	Anticoagulants—Cats in heart failure have an increased risk for developing blood clots. Giving an anti-clotting mediation, such as clopidogrel, can reduce this risk.

Recovery and Management of an Enlarged Heart in Cats
An enlarged heart in cats is a terminal disease if it’s caused by a condition other than taurine deficiency.

On average, cats diagnosed with non-taurine-responsive DCM live only 11 days after diagnosis. This is likely because DCM is a progressive disease and most affected cats are already in heart failure by the time they are seen by a veterinarian.

Cats with an enlarged heart due to a taurine deficiency have a similarly poor prognosis during the initial treatment period. However, once taurine supplementation raises the concentration in the blood, most cats recover fully. It can take several months for a cat’s heart to return to normal in these cases.

Prevention of an Enlarged Heart in Cats
Because the cause of an enlarged heart in cats is typically unknown, it is difficult to prevent most cases.

However, since taurine deficiency has been shown to contribute to this condition in the past, pet parents should feed their cats a commercial cat food rather than a homemade diet.

498,Enlarged Gums in Cats,"Gingival Hyperplasia in Cats

Gingival hyperplasia is a medical condition by which a cat's gingival tissue becomes inflamed and enlarged. Enlargement is typically caused by dental plaque or other bacterial growth along the gum line. This condition is relatively rare in cats, and in many cases can be prevented with good oral hygiene habits.

Symptoms and Types

Common symptoms of gum enlargement include:


    Thickening of the gums
    Increase in the height of the gums
    Pockets developing in the gums
    Areas of inflammation in the gums
    Growth/mass formation on the gum 	line


Causes

The most common cause of gingival hyperplasia is bacteria and plaque along the gum line. This disease will also affect the bones and the structures supporting the teeth. If left untreated, this condition can lead to periodontal disease.

Diagnosis

Gingival hyperplasia is often diagnosed during a veterinary mouth inspection. If there is a gingival mass present, a biopsy will be performed, with tissue taken from the mass for examination, so that cancer (neoplasia) can be either confirmed or ruled out. X-ray images will also be taken to rule out potentially serious underlying medical conditions.

  

Treatment

In some more serious cases, surgical repair and/or deep cleaning and re-contouring of your cat's gums may be performed to help return the gum line to its original shape and to return any formed pockets to normal. Pain medication will be given as needed to reduce discomfort for your cat. Overall, an in depth dental cleaning, along with oral antibiotics (antimicrobials) will be used to clean and repair your cat's gums, and to reduce the swelling and enlargement.

Living and Management

It is important that you take your cat for routine dental cleanings, along with maintaining good oral hygiene, in order to prevent the formation or recurrence of enlarged gums. Animals with gingival hyperplasia generally will have a good outcome with treatment, although relapse is common. There are some potential complications with gum enlargement, including deeper pocket formation in the gums, which can encourage additional bacterial growth within the pockets."," and Types

499,Encephalitis in Cats,"What Is Encephalitis in Cats?
Encephalitis occurs when the brain becomes inflamed; it is a life-threatening condition that must be treated as quickly as possible.

In cats, encephalitis is often caused by an infection either directly to the brain or elsewhere in the body, reaching the brain via the bloodstream or nervous system. As a result, the brain swells, causing pain that often extends to the neck and other parts of the body. Confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness can occur as damage to the brain worsens.

Encephalitis may occur by itself or with other parts of the nervous system, such as the spinal cord (encephalomyelitis) or the meninges (meningoencephalitis), which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

Encephalitis in cats is not very common. It is seen more often in older cats, and there are no specific breeds predisposed to this condition.

Symptoms of Encephalitis in Cats
Your cat may experience vague symptoms that might not be noticeable right away, such as fever, lethargy, or a decreased appetite.

Cats with encephalitis often experience symptoms related to dysfunction of the nervous system, such as:


	
	Generalized weakness and trouble walking
	
	
	Neck pain
	
	
	Behavioral changes (e.g., aggression, reclusiveness, depression)
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Visual deficits such as blindness
	
	
	Head tilting and circling
	
	
	Coma
	
	
	Death
	


Causes of Encephalitis in Cats
Most cases of encephalitis in cats result from these types of infections:


	
	Viral, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or rabies
	
	
	Bacterial, such as Staphylococcus and Bacteroides spp.
	
	
	Tick-borne, such as Lyme Disease
	
	
	Parasitic, such as toxoplasmosis, heartworm disease, or roundworm infection
	
	
	Fungal, such as cryptococcosis
	


Encephalitis in cats may also simply be caused by an infection spread from another part of the body, such as the ears or sinuses. Bite wounds or other traumatic injuries, foreign bodies, or immune-mediated cases where the body’s immune system attacks itself are other common causes of encephalitis.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Encephalitis in Cats
Your veterinarian usually conducts a physical exam and orders basic bloodwork such as a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, and urinalysis. The results from these tests are not sufficient to diagnose encephalitis, but they can suggest a neurologic condition resulting from an infection or inflammation. Additional tests may include chest x-rays and an abdominal ultrasound to look for other organ involvement and prognostic factors.

Be sure to tell your veterinarian of any recent travel you have been on, as certain diseases are more common in certain parts of the U.S. than others, and it can help narrow down the causes of your cat’s disease. Your vet may also want to know your cat’s vaccination status to make sure she is protected from possible exposure to wild animals and other diseases.

Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary neurologist for an MRI and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap, which are done under anesthesia. The MRI takes an image of your cat’s brain, and the CSF tap collects some of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to be analyzed for signs of infection and inflammation. The sample may also be cultured to look for infectious organisms.

In rare cases, a biopsy of the brain or a postmortem examination may be the only way to determine the nature of the disease. These cases may also be called “idiopathic” or “immune-mediated” when the cause of the disease is unknown.

Treatment of Encephalitis in Cats
The first step in treating encephalitis in cats is to admit them to the hospital and give them pain medication, antibiotics, IV fluids, nutrition, and anticonvulsants. Once the test results return, treatment is tailored toward the cause:


	
	Antifungal medication such as Itrafungol for fungal infections
	
	
	Antibiotics such as clindamycin for certain protozoal and bacterial infections
	
	
	Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisolone, cyclosporine, or lomustine for immune- mediated encephalitis
	


Treatment often takes weeks to months, and in some cases, years.

Recovery and Management of Encephalitis in Cats
The prognosis of a cat suffering from encephalitis depends on the cause. Cats with immune-mediated encephalitis have a better prognosis despite needing lifelong treatment, whereas encephalitis caused by rabies will more likely result in death. For some cats, relapses can occur if treatment is weaned or discontinued. Discuss the risks and benefits of future vaccinations with your veterinarian, as relapses can occur after vaccinations.

Cats with encephalitis may also require physical therapy or environmental modifications if permanent damage occurs. Unfortunately, some cats may die or are humanely euthanized despite treatment.

Prevention of Encephalitis in Cats?

There is no guarantee that your cat will not develop encephalitis in their lifetime. However, there are some steps you can take to minimize the risk —keep your cat indoors, vaccinate them, and promptly treat them for any infection, bite, or wound.

500,Electrolyte Disturbance in Cats,"Hypophosphatemia in Cats



A low concentration of phosphorus in the blood serum can be caused by shifts of phosphorus from the extracellular fluid (the fluid outside of the cells) into the body cells, reduced intestinal absorption of phosphorus, or reduced renal (kidney) phosphorus reabsorption.



In patients that are being treated with insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis (a condition in which the body burns fatty acids and produces acidic ketone bodies in response to insulin shortage, or are undergoing refeeding with glycolysis (synthesized glucose) for treatment of starvation, a resulting rapid production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, a nucleotide that transports chemical energy within cells) can lead to relocation of phosphorus into cells. If not diagnosed, it can further lead to acute extracellular hypophosphatemia (an electrolyte disturbance).



Because phosphorus is an important component of ATP, low serum phosphorus concentration can cause ATP depletion and affect cells with high ATP-energy demands, such as red blood cells, skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and brain cells. A state of hypophosphatemia can also lead to a reduction in erythrocyte 2,3-DPG, resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.



Symptoms



Symptoms are generally consistent with the primary disease that is responsible for the hypophosphatemia, rather than any that would be related to the phosphate concentration itself.




	Hemolytic anemia (breaking down of red blood cells) secondary to severe hypophosphatemia
	Red or dark-colored urine due to hemoglobinuria (protein hemoglobin is found in abnormally high concentrations in the urine) from hemolysis (breaking open of red blood cells)
	Tachypnea (rapid breathing), dyspnea (shortness of breath), and anxiety secondary to hypoxia (shortage of oxygen in the body)
	Muscle weakness
	Mental depression
	Rapid, shallow respirations due to poor respiratory muscle function




Causes




	Maldistribution - enteral nutrition (tube in nose) or total intravenous nutrition
	Treatment of diabetes mellitus
	Carbohydrate loading with insulin administration
	Respiratory alkalosis (reducing hydrogen ion concentration of arterial blood plasma)
	Reduced intestinal absorption of phosphorus - phosphorus-poor diet
	Vitamin D deficiency
	Phosphate-binding agent
	Malabsorption syndromes – conditions which prevent absorption of nutrients
	Reduced renal (kidney) phosphate reabsorption
	Undiagnosed or poorly regulated diabetes mellitus
	Prolonged anorexia, starvation, or malnutrition
	Phosphate-poor diets or intravenous nutrition solutions




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms  that you have provided, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis to determine the priority for treatment. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.





Treatment



If your cat is suffering from severe hypophosphatemia, your veterinarian will need to hospitalize the cat for immediate treatment. If the condition is caused by insulin therapy or intravenous nutrients and vitamins, these treatments will be suspended until supplemental phosphate has been administered for a few hours. If a condition of anemia is present, fresh whole blood transfusions may be required. Conversely, if your cat is only suffering a moderate case of hypophosphatemia, it may be treated on an outpatient basis as long as the cat's condition is stable.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will need to measure your cat's phosphorus levels every 6–12 hours until the concentration of phosphorous remains stable within the normal range. If hyperphosphatemia recurs, all supplementation will be stopped and your cat will be provided with intravenous fluid until the phosphorus levels return to normal. Follow-up care will include monitoring your cat's condition for acute (sudden and severe) renal failure, a condition that some hyperphosphatemic patients become more prone to, and monitoring potassium concentrations daily until they, too, are remaining stable.","



Symptoms are generally consistent with the primary disease that is responsible for the hypophosphatemia, rather than any that would be related to the phosphate concentration itself.

501,Electrocution in Cats,"What Is Electrocution in Cats?
Electrocution in cats is almost always accidental and fortunately not that common. But when it occurs, the effects can be quite devastating, even fatal. Electrocution is considered a medical emergency and often occurs when cats chew on an electrical cord or wire. The electrical energy from the cord passes through the body, which leads to tremors, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), breathing difficulties, shock, and changes in the nervous system.

After an injury to the nervous system, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) can often happen due to changes in pressure and the release of certain chemicals and chemical agents in the cat’s body.

It is important to note that pulmonary edema can occur hours after the initial injury, which is why it is critical to seek veterinary treatment immediately, even if your cat seems fine. The severity of injuries can vary based on the type of electrical current, its strength, time of exposure, and resistance to it.  

Types of Electrical Injuries in Cats

The most common cause of electrocution in cats occurs from biting or chewing wires. Cats can also experience electrical injuries from contact with exposed wires, faulty circuits, or being struck by lightning. 

Even though all cats can suffer from electrical injuries, kittens and younger cats, often due to their inquisitive nature and teething behavior, will more commonly experience electrocution from chewing wires. 

Symptoms of Electrocution in Cats
If you witness the electrocution, you will probably see your cat collapse, convulse, or develop muscle tremors. Her whiskers or facial hair may be singed, and there will most likely be burns on her lips, tongue, palate, and teeth. If not witnessed, symptoms of electrocution can appear as the following:


	
	Apnea (lack of breathing)
	
	
	Bluish gums and mucous membranes (lips, nose)
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Decreased appetite or trouble swallowing
	
	
	Fractures to the teeth
	
	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Oronasal fistulae (holes that develop between the mouth and nasal cavity)
	
	
	Respiratory distress—faster respiratory rate than normal; breathing with the whole body; or open-mouth breathing (panting)
	
	
	Seizures or tremors
	
	
	Sudden collapse and death
	


What To Do if Your Cat Chews an Electrical Cord

Thankfully, electrical cord injuries are uncommon, but when they occur, the effects are often serious. The first thing to do if you notice the electrocution or find your cat near an  exposed wire is to turn off the electrical power or circuit breaker. Do not touch your cat until you are sure there is no active electrical current.

Second, evaluate your cat, looking for signs of consciousness, breathing, and a heartbeat. Your cat requires prompt medical evaluation even if she appears fine, because life-threatening complications can develop later.

Treatment of Electrocution in Cats
Treatment of electrical injuries in cats is often individual, based upon the severity of symptoms and degree of injuries, though supportive care measures are mainly used, including:


	
	Oxygen therapy and pain management while minimizing stress are the most important and necessary steps for initial management. IV fluid therapy, careful use of diuretics, anti-arrhythmic drugs, muscle relaxers, and bronchodilators may be given, and some cats may require mechanical ventilation if respiratory problems are severe.
	
	
	Burns are often treated with basic wound care—cleaning and bandaging, then antibiotics and pain management. Oral antiseptic mouth rinses along with sucralfate, a medication often prescribed to treat stomach ulcers, may be used to aid in coating lesions in the mouth and esophagus associated from secondary thermal burns.
	
	
	Soft food or a gruel-type mixture may often be fed while the burns heal, and if the wounds are severe enough, a feeding tube may be warranted.
	


Recovery of Electrocution in Cats
Cats that receive prompt medical attention often have a good prognosis for recovery. Your cat will most likely need to be hospitalized and monitored for several days, as pulmonary edema often resolves in that timeframe, assuming no underlying permanent damage has occurred. 

Fortunately, most cats recover without any significant long-term damage. Some cats with extensive burns may require additional procedures aimed at wound healing, which may include surgery.

Prevention of Electrocution in Cats

The most effective way to prevent electrical injuries to your cat is to prevent access to wires. “Cat proofing” your home is always a best practice prior to adoption.  Keep doors closed or use baby gates if cats have access to rooms with exposed wires. You should also consider products such as anti-chew wire covers to keep cats protected from exposed wires. 

Inspect cords for signs of wear and damage, then promptly get rid of exposed wires and unplug devices and cords when not in use. Additional steps to prevent injuries include anchoring cords to the wall with connectors or using a specially designed wire cover. 

Especially during holiday months when more lights, cords, and fans may be used, it is critical to keep cats away from all plugs and cords.

Electrical injuries from lightning strikes or chewing on cords and wires can cause significant injury, including death.
Can cats die from chewing on cords?Yes. Chewing on cords is by far the most common cause of electrocution in cats. Ingestion of the wires or their plastic coating can also cause an intestinal obstruction. 
How long does it take for a cat to recover from electric shock?Most cats that receive prompt medical attention and show mild to moderate symptoms of electric shock can recover within a few days.  The first 24–48 hours are the most critical, and cats that suffer extensive injury, have more prolonged contact with wires or cords, or receive higher currents often have poor outcomes.

If you witness the electrocution, you will probably see your cat collapse, convulse, or develop muscle tremors. Her whiskers or facial hair may be singed, and there will most likely be burns on her lips, tongue, palate, and teeth. If not witnessed, symptoms of electrocution can appear as the following:


	
	Apnea (lack of breathing)
	
	
	Bluish gums and mucous membranes (lips, nose)
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Decreased appetite or trouble swallowing

502,Ehrlichiosis in Cats,"What is Ehrlichiosis in Cats?
Ehrlichiosis is a rare, poorly understood tick-borne disease that affects the blood cells of cats. Ehrlichia, the bacteria that causes ehrlichiosis, is a Rickettsial disease. These are typified by bacteria that only live inside other cells, causing disease in dogs, cats, and humans. The disease in cats is called feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis.

It is unclear which ticks transmit Ehrlichia to cats, but most likely they are similar to the brown dog tick that transmits a similar condition in dogs. These ticks become infected by feeding on diseased hosts. Ticks require multiple hosts throughout their life cycle, including rodents, white-tailed deer, dogs, and cats.

Ehrlichia can be transmitted to cats as quickly as three hours after a tick becomes attached. Bacteria enter the cat through the bite wound and saliva. Once in the bloodstream, the Ehrlichia bacteria infects and reproduces in the cat’s white blood cells, spreading through tissues. This can create problems with white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, and cause disease in organs throughout the body.

While dogs with ehrlichiosis experience three stages of the disease, this does not appear to occur in cats. They may have co-infections with other viruses and tick-borne diseases, which will lead to worsening clinical signs. 

Symptoms of Ehrlichiosis in Cats 
Symptoms of feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis vary greatly. Common symptoms include:


	
	Fever
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Pale mucous membranes (gums)
	
	
	Bruising and bleeding
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Joint pain
	
	
	Uveitis (inflammation in the eye)
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Enlarged spleen, which may make the abdomen appear enlarged
	
	
	Nervous system issues (meningitis, brain bleeds)
	


Causes of Ehrlichiosis in Cats
A tick acquires ehrlichiosis after feeding on an infected host. Most ticks that cause tick-borne disease require three hosts throughout their life to reproduce and complete their life cycle. These hosts include rodents, rabbits, deer, foxes, dogs, and cats. Once a tick is infected, it transmits the disease to cats through a bite as it feeds on the cat’s blood. The bacteria appear in the bloodstream and white blood cells a few weeks after the tick feeds.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Ehrlichiosis in Cats
Veterinarians may suspect a tick-borne disease, such as ehrlichiosis, based on clinical history and symptoms. However, because ehrlichiosis is extremely rare, other causes for clinical signs should be thoroughly evaluated. Blood work plays a major role in diagnosing ehrlichiosis, as well as side effects and complications. Diagnostic tests include:


	
	Blood chemistry
	
	
	Complete blood count: Cats with ehrlichiosis commonly have low platelets, anemia, and increased monocytes (a certain white blood cell).
	
	
	Blood smear: Ehrlichia organisms may be visualized in white blood cells, but it is rare to find them in the peripheral blood.
	
	
	Serology and PCR assays: For Ehrlichia, these tests can be used for definitive diagnosis but may cross-react with other rickettsial species, causing the possibility for false positives and negatives.
	
	
	X-rays: These may be taken to rule out fractures or other causes of joint pain.
	


Treatment of Ehrlichiosis in Cats
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for cats with confirmed or suspected feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis. Most cats respond rapidly, within days. Cats are treated for suspected ehrlichiosis for at least 28 days.

Owners should use caution when using doxycycline in cats. In tablet form, it can cause esophageal strictures— narrowing scar-like formations in the esophagus—if it gets stuck. Many veterinarians use liquid doxycycline or follow the tablet with a good amount of water.

If your cat does not respond appropriately, other diagnoses should be considered, or different antibiotics like tetracycline or imidocarb may be prescribed.

During acute illness, depending on the severity of clinical signs, cats may require supportive care, including:


	
	Intravenous fluid therapy
	
	
	Nutritional support
	
	
	Pain management
	
	
	Blood transfusions
	


Recovery and Management of Ehrlichiosis in Cats
Overall, the prognosis for cats with feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis is good. Cats should show signs of initial improvement over three days, but complete recovery may take longer based on the severity of the disease.

Antibiotics are usually administered for a full month, sometimes longer. While most cats respond favorably, some do not recover and die or are euthanized due to the disease. Common long-term complications include chronic arthritis, ocular issues, anemia, and side effects from blood transfusions.

Veterinarians may recommend rechecking bloodwork to ensure complete removal of the organism 1-2 months after treatment. If the results are still positive and the cat is still symptomatic, a second round of antibiotics may be required.

Prevention of Ehrlichiosis in Cats

There is no vaccine to prevent ehrlichiosis in dogs or cats. Tick avoidance and prevention is critical to ensure the safety of pets. There are a variety of tick preventives on the market, and your veterinarian can help you make the best choice for your pet.

Be sure to check your pet for ticks and remove any you find. Ehrlichia is zoonotic, which means it can infect humans. It’s important to note that cats cannot transmit Ehrlichia directly to their owners; an infected tick would need to bite a human. But dogs and cats can bring unattached ticks in from outside. Ensure that your cat is up to date on tick prevention, and check your cat for ticks whenever they come in from outside.
Ehrlichiosis in Cats FAQs What do ticks look like on cats?Ticks are small ectoparasites, some only a few millimeters in size. When feeding, they become engorged and swell to several times their original size. They are in the arachnid family and therefore have eight legs in their adult form.
How do I remove a tick from a cat?Veterinary staff can remove the tick for you. At home you can use a tool called the Tick Tornado to fully remove these pests. Do not use a match or a flame, as you could injure yourself or your cat.
Can I get ehrlichiosis from my cat?A cat may bring an unattached tick into the home that could bite a human and transmit ehrlichiosis. However, your cat cannot directly transmit the disease to you.

503,Ear Mites in Cats,"What Are Ear Mites in Cats?
Ear mites, scientifically known as Otodectes cynotis, are common among cats of all ages. They are especially prevalent in kittens and outdoor cats. These mites are highly contagious and can spread frequently among cats and dogs during close contact. Ear mites burrow into the ear canals, causing extreme irritation and inflammation. Pets who are infested usually experience itching, head shaking, and abnormal ear discharge.

Although ear mites in cats can cause extreme discomfort, they are not typically life-threatening.

However, if left untreated, they can cause secondary bacterial infections, pain, and severe inflammation in the ear canals. In severe cases, this can progress to rupture of the ear drum and hearing loss. If you notice thick ear debris and your cat is scratching their ears more than normal, promptly bring them to a veterinarian to determine the underlying cause.

Symptoms of Ear Mites in Cats
Symptoms of ear mites in cats can include:


	
	Thick, dark ear debris
	
	
	Ear pain
	
	
	Head shaking
	
	
	Frequent scratching of ears
	
	
	Tilting of the head
	
	
	Strong odor of the ear
	
	
	Hair loss around the ears and eyes
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	




Causes of Ear Mites in Cats 
Cats get ear mites from coming into close contact with another animal who has them. Ear mites are highly contagious and spread quickly among housemates, including other cats and dogs. Kittens commonly contract ear mites from their mother.

Cats who are not kept up-to-date on monthly preventatives are especially at risk for getting ear mites if they are exposed. While indoor cats can be affected, ear mites tend to be more common in cats who are allowed outside, due to their increased risk of exposure to other infested animals and the environment.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Ear Mites in Cats
Cats with symptoms of ear mites should be seen by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis. Pet parents will be asked if their cat is on any monthly preventatives, if there are any other pets in the household, and if their cat spends any time outdoors.

A veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam, paying close attention to the cat’s ears using a special instrument called an otoscope.

Typically, if the veterinarian finds debris in the cat’s ears that look like coffee grounds, ear mites are highly likely. However, ear cytology (the microscopic examination of cells) can be used to support a diagnosis and is done for two reasons:


	
	To check for mites: A veterinarian uses a cotton swab to gently remove material from the ear, adds it to a small amount of oil, and views it under the microscope. Ear mites and their eggs are easily viewed this way.
	
	
	To check for a bacterial infection: Material from the ear is rolled onto a slide via a cotton swab. The slide is then stained and examined under a microscopic to check for bacteria. Secondary bacterial infections in the ear canal are common among cats with ear mites.
	


Treatment of Ear Mites in Cats
Cats require treatment to get rid of ear mites. An ear cleanser, such as Epi-Otic® Advanced, should be used daily to remove excess debris during this treatment period.
Mentioned in this ArticleVirbac  Epi-Otic Advanced Ear Cleaner for Dogs & CatsRated 0 out of 5 stars0Reviews$12.34Chewy PriceShop on ChewyThere are two main options for treating ear mites in cats:


	
	Topical drops: These can be administered directly into the ear canal to kill mites. Examples of effective medications are milbemycin and ivermectin.
	
	
	Flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives: These medications are applied to the cat’s skin in between the shoulder blades and are effective in killing ear mites after a single dose. Examples include those from Revolution® and Advantage Multi™.
	


If a bacterial infection is also present in the ear canal, a topical antibiotic ointment will be used alongside mite treatment. In cats with severe ear inflammation, topical or oral steroids—such as prednisolone—may be prescribed.

Because ear mites are quickly spread during close contact, all pets in the household should be treated by a veterinarian.

Recovery and Management of Ear Mites in Cats
Cats typically recover from ear mites after a single course of topical treatment, as long as pet parents closely follow their veterinarian’s instructions on how to clean the ears and apply the medication. Elimination of mites takes about a month, but cats generally start to feel better just a couple of days after beginning treatment.

It’s also important that pet parents bring their cat back to the veterinarian for a recheck appointment after completing treatment. This is to confirm that all ear mites have been eliminated and no additional treatment is necessary.

Prevention of Ear Mites in Cats
An important way to prevent ear mites in cats is to apply topical flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives each month year-round. Additionally, keeping a cat’s ears clean through once-weekly ear cleansing prevents buildup that can create a favorable environment for ear mites.

Since ear mites are highly contagious, healthy pets should be kept separate from infested ones until the mites have been eliminated. Keeping cats indoors can also reduce your cat’s risk of exposure to mites.
Ear Mites in Cats FAQsAre cat ear mites contagious to humans?Ear mites do not typically spread from cat to human. However, in rare instances, people living in a house with a cat who has ear mites can develop a rash if the mites jump onto their skin and bite it.
Do indoor cats have ear mites?Indoor cats can get ear mites, especially if they have been in close contact with an infested animal.
What instantly kills ear mites in cats?There are no products that kill ear mites instantly. Several topical medication options kill mites after a single use, but full elimination of mites takes about one month.

504,Early Contractions and Labor in Cats,"Premature Labor in Cats

There are many conditions that can cause a pregnant cat, or queen, to experience premature contractions leading to preterm delivery of kittens. Bacterial infections, viral infections, death of one or more fetuses, ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, injury, malnutrition, a change in environment/moving, and basically any kind of stress that can send a cat into mental and physical distress can lead to early labor. In some cases, a cat may be genetically predisposed to preterm labor.

Preterm delivery in cats is defined by a birth that occurs before the ideal 63 days of gestation. Generally, kittens born at 61 days of gestation, or later, have a high chance for  survival.

Symptoms and Types


    Delivery before 61 days in cats
    Bloody discharge or tissue
    Loss of appetite
    Excessive vocalizing
    Cat may hide away
    May seek more attention than usual, show more affection than usual


Causes


    Genetics
    Bacterial infection
    Lyme disease
    Viral infection
    Herpes
    Injury
    Malnutrition
    Hormonal imbalance
    Sudden drop in progesterone suspected
    Low thyroid levels in older females
    Non-infectious uterine or vaginal disease
    Ovarian cysts
    Drugs
    Corticosteroids
    Chemotherapy

Stressful events:

    Emotional disturbances in household: fights, screaming
    Moving to new location
    Cold temperatures
    Receiving vaccinations while pregnant (especially those for distemper and hepatitis)
    Boarding
    Cat (breed) shows
    Loud noise


Diagnosis

If you find that your cat is experiencing early labor you will want to consult with your veterinarian. You will need to begin by giving your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health before and during pregnancy, her onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have brought this condition on. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, while being careful not to bring on any further undue stress. Standard laboratory tests may include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to make sure that there are no underlying diseases that are causing the premature labor symptoms. The blood tests will show whether your cat's progesterone levels are abnormally low.



Ultrasound imaging will be performed to diagnose fetal death or abnormal position of fetuses, which may cause a difficult delivery. However, an ultrasound can also give your veterinarian a visual on the fetal heartbeats along with more fetal detail. If the kittens are stillborn, or if they die shortly after birth, they should be necropsied by your veterinarian to determine the cause of death.

Treatment

If your cat is going into labor early, immediately contact your veterinarian or call the nearest emergency veterinarian for guidance. Your cat will most probably require medical treatment, either for an illness or to remove stillborn fetuses.

Living and Management

If your cat is pregnant you should not expose your cat to other animals in the three weeks before delivery and in the three weeks after giving birth. Even animals that have been living in your own house in close proximity with your cat should be segregated from your cat during this vulnerable time. As much as possible, keep your cat isolated in a warm, quiet room, where she can create a nesting area for herself and her kittens.

Some cats feel the need to hide in a closet or secluded spot, while others have no problems giving birth out in the open. If you can, provide both options to your cat.  Do not give your cat any medications during pregnancy without first consulting with your veterinarian. This includes flea medications and vaccinations. If your veterinarian is treating your cat for anything, make sure to tell the doctor that your cat is pregnant. For example, you may allow your veterinarian to deworm your cat while it is pregnant, as long as you inform your veterinarian about the pregnancy.

Do not board your cat or otherwise move it during pregnancy unless you have no other option.

If your cat has bloody vaginal discharge while still preterm, call your veterinarian for advice immediately. You may want to consider taking your cat to the veterinarian for a  pregnancy check-up at 30 days of pregnancy to confirm the pregnancy is progressing as it should.

Most of the same precautions regarding medicines and vaccination hold true for the time following birth, while your cat is nursing her kittens. Always consult with your veterinarian before giving your cat anything that might make its way into her bloodstream and milk."," and Types

505,Ear Cancer in Cats,"Auricular Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Cats



Cats can be afflicted with several types of skin tumors, even on their ears. One type of tumor that can affect the ears is a squamous cell carcinoma. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale-like tissue cells are called the squamous.



Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body.



An auricular (relating to the ear) squamous cell carcinoma may be caused by excess sun exposure. It is more common in white cats and in cats that have white ears. This type of tumor starts out as red, crusty looking areas on the tips of the ears. The sores, or ulcers, may seem to come and go and will slowly get bigger with time. There may be ulcers on the face as well. This type of cancer can be treated successfully if it is caught early.



Symptoms and Types




	Red, crusted sores on the edges of the ears
	Redness may come and go
	Bleeding ulcers on the ears
	Ulcers on the ear that slowly get bigger
	As sores get larger, ear tips may disappear, ear may become malformed
	Sometimes, sores on the face




Causes




	Excessive exposure to the sun over a long period




Diagnosis



You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Be sure to describe any sores that have been apparent on other parts of the body, even if you suspect they were caused by injuries resulting from outdoor activity, or from scratching at the skin.



During the examination, your veterinarian will look carefully for other sores or tumors on your cat's body. The lymph nodes will be carefully felt to determine if they are enlarged, an indication that the body is reacting to an infection or invasion. A sample of lymph fluid may be taken to test for cancerous cells. Your veterinarian will order complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your cat's other organs are working normally and to determine whether the white blood cell count is higher than normal; again, an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease or infection.



A biopsy will be taken of the ulcerated tissue on your cat's ear so that your doctor can diagnose the specific type of growth it is, whether carcinoma or a benign mass of tissue. This is necessary for differentiating the ulcers from any other condition that could be causing the same symptoms. X-rays images of your cat's chest and skull will allow your veterinarian to visually inspect the lungs for signs of any abnormalities, especially tumors, and to make sure that the carcinoma has not spread into the bones.







Treatment



Treatment will depend on how many ulcers your cat has on its ears and how large the ulcers are. If there is only one small ulcer, it may be removed by cryosurgery, a freezing technique. If the ulcer is larger, or if there are several ulcers, it/they will be treated with surgery. During surgery, most or all of the upright part (pinna) of your cat's ear will be removed. In some cases, the ear canal may also need to be removed. Most cats recover well from this surgery, even if the ear canal needs to be removed.



If surgery is not a practical option, chemotherapy may be used to kill the cancerous cells. However, chemotherapy is not usually as effective as surgery. In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a veterinary cancer specialist so that you can determine if there are other viable treatment options.



Living and Management



Once your cat has recovered from surgery, it should be able to lead a normal life. Your cat may look different, but it will adjust to its changed body. You will need to monitor your cat closely to make sure it does not develop new sores on its face or head. Try to limit the amount of time your cat spends out in the sun. If you must let your cat out during the daytime, you will need to apply sunscreen to areas of the body that have a thin hair coat. If your cat tends to spend a lot of time on the window sill, you might place a shade or reflector over the glass to block ultraviolet (UV) rays from reaching your cat. As with any cancer, it is recommended that you take your cat for regular progress check with your veterinarian.



Prevention



Limit the amount of time your cat spends in the sun, especially if it is white cat, or if it has a lighter hair coat. When your cat does go out in the sun, apply sunscreen to its ears and nose."," and Types

506,Ear Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"Ceruminous Gland Adenocarcinoma of the Ear in Cats



Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is the primary malignant tumor of the sweat glands found in the external auditory canal. Though rare, it is one of the most common malignant tumor of the ear canal in older cats. And while it may be locally invasive, it has a low rate of distant metastasis (spreading of the cancer).



In addition, there is no known gender predisposition for this type of tumor, but it is more common in cats than dogs.



Symptoms and Types



Similar to otitis externa, cats with ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma exhibit vestibular signs such as dizziness, tilting of the head, uncoordination, and frequent stumbling or falling. Local lymph node enlargement may also be seen. Other symptoms depend on the stage of the cancer.



Early stages of nodular masses:


	Pale pink
	Break off easily
	Open ulcers
	Bleeding




Later stages:


	Large mass(es) which fill the canal and invade through the canal wall into surrounding structures


 

Causes



Experts are still uncertain of the exact cause for this type of adenocarcinoma, but chronic inflammation may play a role in tumor development.



Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. Your doctor  will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and an electrolyte panel.



Radiographic and CT (computed tomography) imaging are essential to confirming the diagnosis. Skull X-rays, for example, can help to determine if the tympanic bullae (the bony extension of the temporal bone in the skull) are involved in the mass. And thoracic X-rays and CT scans help identify if the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other organs. A tissue sample for biopsy will be essential for determining the exact nature of the growth.







Treatment



Ear canal ablation (complete removal of the ear and ear canal) and lateral bulla osteotomy (removing the bony part of the ear canal) are preferred over lateral ear resection (removal of the majority of the ear). This is because these methods may extend your pet's survival time by three to four times when compared with lateral ear resection, which is typically only ten months. On large masses or those found to difficult to remove, radiotherapy should be performed.



Living and Management



Unfortunately, there is a poor prognosis associated with extensive tumor involvement and neurologic signs (dizziness, falling, head tilt, etc.). Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your pet 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, and 24 months after treatment for a routine physical exam and chest X-rays.

507,Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats,"What Is Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats?
Dry eye is the common name for Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), a medical condition caused by poor tear production that leads to inflammation of the outer layer of the eye, the cornea, and the surrounding tissues. Tears are necessary to keep the cornea moist and to remove debris from the eye. A cat’s lacrimal gland (located at the top outer edge of the eye) and third eyelid gland produce a film of tears that is a mixture of mucous, water, and oils/fats. KCS reduces the ability of these glands to produce enough tears, resulting in chronic dry eyes.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats
The vet will perform a physical examination of your cat, including a thorough eye exam. During the appointment, it’s important to share any history of symptoms as well as incidents that might have led to dry eye. 

In its early stages, dry eye syndrome in cats can be hard to diagnose from a physical examination alone. It may resemble other problems, like conjunctivitis or inflammation of the tissues of the eye. In early stages of a diagnosis it’s very common for the condition to be treated with these conditions in mind. 

However, if symptoms persist and decreased nasal secretions are also noted, the vet will measure tear production with a procedure called the Schirmer Tear Test (STT). This test involves putting a strip of special paper inside the cat’s lower eyelid and then noting how much fluid the paper absorbs. 

A culture of the tear film may be performed to investigate any bacterial overgrowth on the outer layer of the eye, as secondary infections are common in severe cases of dry eye. Fluorescein stain, or corneal staining, is often performed to identify any ulceration of the cornea. It’s performed with a special ophthalmic instrument and blue light in a dark room. 

Additional diagnostic tests or procedures that may be performed include: 


	
	Intraocular pressure test to determine whether glaucoma is present 
	
	
	Tear duct examination 
	
	
	Flushing to ensure normal tear drainage through the nostrils 
	


Treatment for Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats
The goal of treatment for dry eye syndrome in cats is to stimulate tear production and replace the tear film that protects the cornea from damage. There are 3 commonly used medications to assist with treatment: 


	
	Cyclosporine (brand name Optimmune®), a drug used to prevent organ-transplant rejections in humans, is also used to treat certain immune diseases in cats. When applied as an eye drop or ointment, it suppresses immune destruction, and tear production is improved. This medication is considered the primary therapy for dry eye syndrome in cats. 
	



	
	Tacrolimus is another immune-system-related medication. It’s often tried in medical cases that don’t respond to or respond poorly to cyclosporine.  
	
	
	Pilocarpine, a drug that works on the nervous system, can be useful in treating cases of nervous-system-related dry eye in cats.  
	


Other remedies your vet may suggest include: 


	
	Artificial tear solutions: These are often used in combination with a tear-production stimulant, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, to replace the tear film. Drops may be administered every 2-6 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Artificial tear solutions can be purchased over-the-counter at most pharmacies. 
	
	
	Topical antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications: These will be used to treat underlying infection and inflammation, if noted during physical examination and diagnostic testing. 
	



	
	Gently cleaning the eyes several times a day with a warm, wet washcloth: This can help soothe your cat and may help stimulate tear-film production. 
	
	
	Parotid duct transpositioning: This surgery, often by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist or a veterinarian who is skilled with this delicate procedure, reroutes ducts from the saliva-producing glands in such a way that saliva is delivered to the eyes in place of tears. There is a significant risk of complication, so the surgery should only be pursued when all other options have failed. Saliva can be irritating to the cornea, and some cats are uncomfortable after surgery and require ongoing medical therapy. 
	


Depending on your cat’s diagnosis your veterinarian will be able to determine the best treatment option.  

Management of Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats
You may be asked to return to the vet every 3-4 weeks after the onset of tear production therapy. Once tear production is improving, visits are recommended every 2-4 months until clinical signs stabilize, and about every 6 months thereafter. 

Increased tear production can occur immediately after starting tear-production medications, although in some cats, it may take several weeks. Diseases of the immune system usually require lifelong treatment. Other types may be transient and require treatment only until tear production returns. 

The prognosis is good for most cats with dry eye syndrome. Most cats can enjoy a happy, comfortable life with appropriate monitoring and diligent therapy. 

However, if the condition is diagnosed late in the course of the disease and scarring of the cornea has developed, cats may not respond well to therapy or regain their sight. Once corneal scarring has developed, there is little that can be done to reverse it. 

It’s critical to follow your vet’s treatment plan to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome for your cat. 
Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats FAQsAre some cats more likely to get dry eye than others?There is no breed of cat that has been proven to be more susceptible to dry eye syndrome. However, Burmese cats are more prone to prolapsed third eyelids (cherry eye), and if inappropriate surgical correction is performed, dry eye syndrome can develop.
Is dry eye in cats curable?It’s not curable in most cases, but the condition is treatable. Lifelong therapy may be required.
Are cats with dry eye syndrome in pain?Cats do not seem to need as much tear film as dogs do to be comfortable during blinking. However, with more chronic and severe cases, this condition can be very painful. This becomes obvious when cats are squinting, blinking excessively, or rubbing their eyes.
Can I use over-the-counter eye drops on my cat?Over-the-counter artificial tear solutions are a good option to keep your cat’s eyes lubricated, but these will not stimulate tear production. It’s important to discuss any over-the-counter medications with your veterinarian first before administering to your cat.

508,Drowning (Near Drowning) in Cats,"Hypoxemia Due to Aspiration of Water in Cats
  
There are four phases in a typical drowning: breath-holding and swimming motion; water aspiration, choking, and struggling for air; vomiting; and cessation of movement followed by death. The mammalian diving reflex may occur, leading to a slowed heart rate, a halt in breathing, and blood circulation limited only to the essential organs of the body. Large volumes of water are not typically aspirated at this stage.

Near-drowning is determined by an event that involves prolonged submersion in water, followed by survival for at least 24 hours afterward. Following submersion, typical symptoms include elevated carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream, stimulated respiration, and subsequent aspiration of water into the lungs. In rare cases, hyperventilation prior to submersion, or laryngospasm (spasmodic closing of the larynx) may prevent aspiration of water, an involuntary reaction that can lead to a condition called dry drowning.

Fresh water aspiration leads to a collapse of respiratory cells with possible infectious pneumonia. Hypertonic seawater aspiration leads to a diffusion of water entering the lungs and into the alveoli (the air cells of the lungs). Since the cat cannot obtain enough oxygen, oxygen levels in the blood drop and the blood becomes acidotic (abnormal increase in acidity).

Submersion time, temperature of the water, and the type of water the cat was submerged in (whether the water is fresh, salt, or chemical) will significantly affect the development of organ damage.

Symptoms and Types


    Bluish 	skin and gums
    Coughing 	with clear to frothy red sputum (spit-up)
    Cessation 	of breathing
    Difficulty 	breathing
    Crackling 	sound from the chest
    Vomiting
    Semi-conscious 	and dazed to comatose
    Increased 	or decreased heart rate
    Heart failure


Causes


    Owner 	negligence
    Inadequate 	safety precautions
    Cat 	is in or near water at the time of a seizure
    Following 	head trauma
    Rapid 	drop in blood sugar, abnormal heart beat rhythm, or fainting episode 	while in body of water


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. Standard laboratory tests will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.

Chest X-rays may show aspiration pneumonia or fluid in the lungs one to two days after the near-drowning. Foreign body inhalation may produce segmental lung collapse. Pulmonary injury progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is possible.

An endotracheal or transtracheal wash, followed by a cytologic evaluation and culture with sensitivities is indicated.  Electrocardiographic monitoring examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles may be performed to assess heart damage. Your veterinarian will also want to determine the auditory evoked response (BAER) for hearing loss assessment. Cervical X-rays, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and brain stem may be helpful in select cases.

Treatment

Clear any airway obstructions and give mouth-to-muzzle resuscitation on the site of the accident. Professional medical treatment will need to follow immediately. Your cat will need to be treated on an emergency inpatient basis, with oxygen supplementation given at the hospital. If your cat has severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or imminent respiratory fatigue, a ventilator may be required for respiratory assistance.

Gravitational drainage or abdominal thrusts (i.e., the Heimlich maneuver) are not recommended in the absence of an airway obstruction owing to the high risk of regurgitation and subsequent aspiration of stomach contents. Fluid therapy and acid-base/electrolyte management are crucial for bringing the fluid balance back to normal levels. If your cat is hypothermic, your veterinarian will gradually rewarm the cat's body with blankets over a two- to three-hour period of time. Prolonged parenteral (intravenous) nutrition may be required if your cat is suffering from severe brain or lung injury.

Living and Management

Generally, cats will not have a good prognosis if they are comatose when brought to the veterinary clinic, have severely acidotic blood (pH less than 7.0), or if they require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or mechanical ventilation. Cats that are conscious upon arrival at the clinic will have a good prognosis, as long as no further complications ensue."," and Types

509,Dislocated Eye Lens in Cats,"Lens Luxation in Cats

Lens luxation is the total dislocation of the lens from its normal location. It occurs when the lens capsule separates 360° from the zonules (the fiber-like processes that extend from the ciliary body to the capsule of the lens of the eye) that hold the lens in place. If it occurs at the front of the eye, it comes forward through the pupil into the front chamber. If it goes to the back (posterior), it goes into the posterior segment/vitreous chamber.
 
Secondary luxation, the most common type of lens luxation diagnosed in cats, may result from long term inflammation within the eye, neoplasia (tissue growth) within the eye, or stretching of the eye globe. This secondary form of the condition can occur in any age or breed of cat.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
There are four main types of lens luxation:
 

    Subluxation — partial separation 	of the lens from its zonular  attachments; the lens remains in a 	normal or near-normal position in  the pupil
    Primary luxation — due to a 	pathologic alteration in the  ciliary zonules including abnormal 	development or degeneration; may be  bilateral (both eyes)
    Congenital luxation — often 	associated with microphakia  (abnormally small lens of the eye)
    Secondary luxation — due to 	rupture or degeneration of the  ciliary zonules as a result of 	chronic inflammation, buphthalmia  (increase of intraocular fluid and 	consequent enlargement of the  eyeball), or a tumor within the eye

 
The following signs and symptoms may be observed if your pet is suffering from lens luxation:
 

    Acute or chronically painful 	reddened eye with diffuse corneal swelling, especially if glaucoma 	is also present, or the luxation is in the front of the eye
    Iris trembling (iridodonesis)
    Lens trembling (phacodonesis)
    Abnormally shallow or deep 	anterior (front) chamber
    Abnormally positioned clear part of the lens
    Aphakic crescent — an area of pupil 	devoid of the lens

 
Causes
 
There may be a variety of factors that lead to lens luxation in cats.  For example, a tumor in the eye may physically move the lens out of  position or cause chronic inflammation, leading to zonular degeneration.  The inheritence pattern of primary luxation is uncertain, but it may  occur concurrently with primary glaucoma in some breeds. Trauma rarely  causes a normal lens to luxate, though it can occur when there are signs  of severe uveitis, especially chronic lens-induced uveitis, or hyphema. 
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ophthalmological exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition.
 
 
 
Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Uveitis, glaucoma, and nodular granulomatous episclerokeratitis (inflammatory masses) can also cause painful, red eyes with corneal swelling and may be concurrent with lens luxation. Buphthalmia, enlargement of the eyeball caused by excess fluid within the eyeball, may cause lens luxation; it is usually differentiated from primary lens luxation by history.
 
Corneal endothelial dystrophy or degeneration (opacity of the cornea) may also cause corneal swelling, making it difficult to see the intraocular structures. Diagnosis is made by careful ophthalmic examination and a history of the symptoms.
 
Visual diagnostic techniques may be used to diagnose the cause of the luxation. Thoracic X-rays and abdominal ultrasound may be indicated if the luxation is secondary to an intraocular (within the eye) tumor, and ocular ultrasonography is useful if corneal edema (swelling) or cloudy ocular media prevent a useful examination.
 
Treatment
 
If your cat still has the potential for at least partial vision, the eyes may be best treated by removing the lens using a procedure called intraocular lens prosthesis. Occasionally, topical miotic (constriction of the pupil of the eye) therapy can keep a posteriorly luxated lens behind the pupil and the need for surgery can be prolonged.
 
Irreversibly blind eyes can be treated by evisceration (removal of the internal material from the eye),  or by enucleation with intrascleral prosthesis — removal and subsequent replacement of the eye with an artificial eye. If the condition is secondary to cancer, enucleation is the best choice for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
 
Living and Management
 
After treatment, your cat should be re-examined immediately after the first 24 hours and every three months thereafter. Your doctor  may want to  refer you to an opthalmological veterinarian for evaluation, as intracapsular lens extraction — removal of the entire lens and its capsule — is also indicated for posterior luxations in order to decrease the chance for retinal detachment and chronic uveitis. A specialist can also examine for secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that the lens luxation may affect both eyes if it hasn't already."," and Types

510,Diseases of the Skin on the Nose of the Cat,"Nasal Dermatoses in Cats



Many diseases affect the skin on the noses of cats. This can include bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, or mites. These diseases may affect the bridge of the nose where there is hair, or the smooth part of the nose, where there is no hair. Often, it is the portion of the nose that has hair that is affected. In the case of systemic diseases like lupus or other autoimmune ailments, the whole muzzle is involved. Some systemic diseases cause the part of the nose where there is no hair to lose its pigment or develop ulcers.



A rare condition caused by the sun, called solar dermatitis, also affects the areas of the nose not covered by hair. That area may become inflamed and even ulcerated. Most of these conditions are more likely to occur in kittens under a year of age, but skin cancers are more likely to occur in older cats.

 

Symptoms and Types of Nasal Dermatoses



There are many different symptoms that may be seen in cats affected by nasal dermatoses, among them:




	Ulcers/nodules on skin
	Loss of hair (alopecia)
	Eruptions that have pus
	Loss of pigment
	Excess of pigment
	Redness of skin
	Crusts (scabs)
	Scarring


 

Causes of Nasal Dermatoses



Some factors or diseases that may cause nasal dermatoses include:




	Nasal lesions with pus
	Mites
	Fungus
	Nasal solar dermatitis
	Immune-system disorders
	Connective-tissue disorders
	Zinc-responsive scaling and crusting of skin
	Sensitivity to certain substances, including certain drugs
	Cancer
	Trauma




Diagnosis of Nasal Dermatoses



Your veterinarian will take samples of skin from your cat’s nose to culture for bacteria and fungi. Biopsies and immune system tests will also be conducted.

 





Treatment for Nasal Dermatoses



The underlying cause of the symptoms will determine the appropriate course of treatment.




	If the diagnosis is solar dermatitis, a cortisone lotion will be prescribed to help relieve the inflammation. Your veterinarian will probably also recommend that you keep your cat out of the sun as much as possible. Sunscreens may be recommended and will need to be applied at least twice daily.
	For pus-filled eruptions, cortisone or prednisone will probably be prescribed, with a gradually declining dosage. These medications should only be used under veterinary supervision. Warm soaks are prescribed to get rid of the crusted skin and pus. Also, be aware of the allergens your cat may be susceptible to, such as a plastic or rubber dish, pillow or blanket, or certain drugs.
	For fungal infections, there is a range of medication to choose from, although the veterinarian may want to surgically remove some of the lesions before the course of antifungal treatment begins.
	Surgery may be required for nodules that are not infected. Immunosuppressive therapy may also be prescribed.
	If your cat's only symptom is loss of pigment, your veterinarian may choose not to prescribe treatment.
	For cancerous tumors, surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation is usually required.

511,Diseases From Cat Scratches,"What Is a Zoonotic Disease?
Most people encounter animals regularly in their daily lives. Some of the ways humans rely on animals are for food, work, sports, and companionship. Unfortunately, sharing lives also means sharing germs and illness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a zoonosis or zoonotic disease is any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans or from humans to vertebrate animals.

Zoonotic diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, protozoa, fungi, and other pathogens. These germs cause a wide variety of illnesses, ranging from mild to serious, and can even cause death. It is important to remember that even if an animal does not appear sick, they can still carry diseases that make humans sick.

How Do Zoonotic Diseases Spread?

Zoonoses can be spread directly in bodily secretions or indirectly from areas where animals live or objects and surfaces they touch. Zoonotic disease can also be transmitted to humans by blood-feeding ticks, mosquitoes, or fleas, and it can be foodborne or waterborne.

Although anyone, even healthy people, can get sick from a zoonotic disease, children under age 5, adults over 65, those who are immunocompromised, and pregnant women are at a higher risk.

Prevention includes being aware of what diseases are common in your area, along with practicing proper hand-washing, preventing bites, practicing food safety, and avoiding scratches from animals.

Diseases From Cat Scratches
Most feline infectious diseases only affect cats, but some can be transmitted from cats to people. The likelihood of people contracting diseases from cat scratches is low, but it is possible, especially in vulnerable populations.

The main concern with cat scratches is transmission of a bacterium called Bartonella henselae, which causes cat-scratch disease (CSD), or cat-scratch fever, and is carried in the saliva of infected cats.

About 40% of cats carry the B. henselae bacterium at some point in their lives, and most cats show no signs of illness. CSD is transmitted to people by cat scratches that break the skin, cat bites that cause wounds, or when infected cats lick open wounds in people.

Other less common health conditions resulting from a cat scratch include ringworm, and some bacterial infections can be zoonotic between cats and people. Ringworm is typically spread by touch, not scratch, from cat to human.

Cat Scratch Disease In Humans

Symptoms of Cat-Scratch Fever in Humans
Clinical signs of cat-scratch fever that you may notice include:


	
	Swelling, blister, or raised lesion with redness or pus where scratched
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Headache
	
	
	Sore muscles and joints
	
	
	Fatigue, exhaustion  
	
	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Swollen, enlarged, tender, or painful lymph node where scratched
	


Rarely, those who are immunocompromised, particularly children, may have more serious complications including infections of the bones (osteomyelitis), eyes (neuroretinitis and Parinaud syndrome), brain (encephalopathy), and heart (myocarditis).

Treatment of Cat-Scratch Fever in Humans
Treatment for CSD varies with a person’s age, overall health, symptoms, and how sick the person feels. Antibiotics usually are not needed for CSD lesions, unless the wound appears infected. CSD symptoms are treated by pain medication and by giving fluids for fever and poor appetite. If lymph nodes are swollen and painful, a warm compress may be applied.  

If a cat scratch or bite becomes red or swollen and you develop flu-like symptoms, including headache, decreased appetite, fatigue, joint pain, fever, or swollen and painful lymph nodes, contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.

Most cases of CSD dissipate without medical intervention. Those with rare complications may require intensive antibiotic treatment with azithromycin.

How To Protect Yourself From Diseases From Cat Scratches
To prevent CSD in humans, avoid cat scratches and bites by not playing roughly with them, wash hands after contact, control fleas, and keep cats indoors.

Because most cases of CSD result from contact with kittens that are under 1 year old, those who are immunocompromised should avoid contact. If you are scratched or bitten, wash the area right away with antibacterial soap and water. It is very important to not allow cats to lick any wounds you may have.

Contact your doctor if you suspect your cat may be sick and has scratched you. There are currently no vaccines available for cats against Bartonella.

Long-Term Effects of Cat-Scratch Fever in Humans

Healthy adults generally recover from CSD with no lasting effects, although it may take several months for the skin disease to completely go away.

Those who are immunocompromised may take longer to recover and may require hospitalization and lifelong medical management. In case of rare complications, consult an infectious disease specialist doctor.

512,Dietary Reactions in Cats,"Gastrointestinal Food Reactions in Cats



Gastrointestinal symptoms due to food reactions involve abnormal symptoms to a particular diet. A cat that is experiencing a food reaction is unable to digest, absorb, or utilize a particular ingredient in the food.

 

It is important to note that these reactions are not due to food allergies, which involve an immune reaction to a particular component of a diet. However, both food reactions and food allergy share common symptoms, causes, diagnostics, and even treatments, making it a challenge for the attending veterinarian to differentiate between the two.

 

Reactions to a particular diet are often due to unknown causes, but they may be linked to a particular dietary ingredient, additive, or dietary compound. Also possible are reactions to the toxic effects of particular food contaminants (e.g., Salmonella) or to spoiled foodstuffs (e.g., mold/fungus).

 

Cat of any age, breed or gender can be affected. Lactose intolerance is commonly diagnosed in adult cats. Siamese and Siamese cross cats are found to be at higher risk of food sensitivities.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Symptoms may appear after adding a new foodstuff or source to your cat's diet. The clinical symptoms may subside in the fasted state (medically supervised) or within days of a new dietary change. Common symptoms of a dietary reaction include:

 


	Diarrhea
	Vomiting
	Flatulence/abdominal gas
	Lack of appetite
	Weight loss
	Poor weight gain
	Abdominal pain and discomfort
	Itching/scratching excessively
	Poor body condition


 

Causes

 

In most cases of adverse dietary reactions, there is a history of sudden diet change. The cat may also be reacting to food additives, coloring, spices, or propylene glycol, etc. Other underlying factors include an inability to utilize certain component(s) in a food and toxicity due to contaminated and/or spoiled foods.

 

 

Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will take a detailed and comprehensive history from you, especially regarding the cat's diet. Diagnosis of food reactions can be a daunting task, as there are a number of other health problems that may produce a similar spectrum of symptoms. Moreover, there are other disorders that may occur with dietary intolerances, further complicating the diagnosis.

 

Laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. However, the results of these tests are often found normal if no other underlying disease is present. Further testing may be required to exclude other diseases that may cause similar symptoms in cats.

 

 

 

The most widely practiced diagnostic procedure involves dietary manipulation. In this procedure efforts are made to find out the specific culprit in the diet by minimizing the ingredients and additives. This can be done by feeding the affected cat home-cooked diets or special diet plans. Typically, within a few days of the new diet clinical symptoms will start improving in these patients. This can make it easier to determine the problematic dietary component in the individual cat. After an improvement in clinical symptoms has been confirmed, your veterinarian will try to find the particular offending ingredient by slowly adding various ingredients back into the diet.

 

Your veterinarian may also use endoscopy, a method in which a small camera that is attached to a flexible tube is inserted into the actual space to be examined. In this way the internal structure of the intestines can be closely examined, and will allow your doctor to take a tissue sample from the intestine for laboratory testing. Abdominal X-rays can also be useful in excluding other diseases that may cause similar clinical symptoms.

 



Treatment

 

Cats with severe vomiting, diarrhea or other clinical symptoms may require hospitalization for intravenous fluid administration, antibiotics, and supportive care. In most cases, the cat does not need hospitalization.

 

The cornerstone of a successful treatment plan is in identifying the offending dietary component and excluding it from the diet. If the problematic dietary component cannot be identified, your veterinarian will suggest and help you plan a nutritionally complete exclusion diet. A trial and error method can be employed if a confirmatory diagnosis cannot be achieved. Your veterinarian will devise a plan to include or exclude a particular dietary component and monitor the response.

 

Living and Management

 

The prognosis of most patients is very good, especially if the offending dietary component has been identified. The major goal of therapy is to avoid the causative dietary component.

 

If your cat has been diagnosed with food sensitivities, you will need to avoid feeding your cat food scraps or adding new foodstuffs without first consulting with your veterinarian. If your veterinarian has prescribed a specific diet, adherence to the prescribed diet is of utmost importance.

 

Poor treatment response is commonly due to reduced owner compliance, such as when the cat's owner reverts to giving “treats.” Do not allow children or visitors to feed the cat without prior permission. Good owner compliance will ensure long-term improvement of the clinical symptoms.

513,Diarrhea Due to Clostridium perfringens in Cats,"Clostridial Enterotoxicosis in Cats

 

Clostridium perfringens bacterium is a normal bacteria found in the environment, commonly inhabiting decaying vegetation and marine sediment, as well as raw or improperly cooked meats and poultry. However, when abnormally high levels of this bacteria is found in the intestine, it can lead to Clostridial enterotoxicosis.



Generally, the implications of the intestinal syndrome are limited to infections of the intestinal tract and do not progress to systemic disease conditions. Symptoms typically last a week in acute cases and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Long-term (chronic) cases of clostridial enterotoxicosis, meanwhile, involve recurrences of diarrhea, which may repeat every two to four weeks, and may continue for months to years.



When compared to its incidence in dogs, this is an uncommon condition in cats. Most animals have antibodies that will effectively fight the bacteria and clear it from the body. 





Symptoms and Types

 


	Diarrhea with shiny mucus on its surface
	Small amounts of fresh blood in diarrhea
	Small, meager stools
	May have large volume of watery stools
	Straining to defecate
	Increased frequency of defecation
	Vomiting (on occasion)
	Abdominal discomfort – characterized by standing with lowered front and raised back end, or curling up to cover abdomen, resistant to being touched in abdominal area
	Abnormal amount of flatulence (i.e, passing gas)
	Fever (uncommon)


 

Causes

 

Clostridial enterotoxicosis is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria Clostridium perfringens in the intestine. Often, the bacteria is acquired from the environment (e.g., flora) or as the result of eating raw, undercooked, or old meat. Other risk factors include:




	Dietary changes
	Abnormally high pH level in the intestine
	Deficiency of antibodies
	Exposure to other cats at a hospital or kennel
	Stress to the digestive system due to concurrent disease (e.g., parvovirus, gastroenteritis, and inflammatory bowel disease)






Diagnosis

 

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition, such as time spent outdoors, rummaging through garbage or getting hold of old or uncooked meat, or being boarded at a kennel. 

 

Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical exam on your cat as well as standard blood work, including a complete blood count, chemical blood profile, and urinalysis. Most of these tests will return normal. Because this infection has obvious intestinal symptoms, a fecal sample will need to be taken for microscopic analysis. 

 

This intestinal disease is sometimes difficult to identify because there is no one good test for it. Often, false positive results will return as the result of interfering substances in the feces. Your veterinarian may also want to use an endoscope to visualize the interior of your cat's intestines, and possibly take a tissue sample.

 





Treatment

 

Treatment is generally simple, with outpatient care provided until your cat has recovered from the infection. In some cases, when diarrhea and/or vomiting has been severe and the animal has become dehydrated and low in electrolytes, fluid therapy will need to be administered in a hospital setting.

 

Your veterinarian may prescribe a week’s worth of oral antibiotics if the Clostridium perfringens toxin is found. Cats that need to be treated for long-term cases of diarrhea may need to be given antibiotics for a longer period of time. 

 

Dietary management is also helpful in the treatment of this condition. High-fiber diets and diets formulated with prebiotic and probiotic ingredients (like lactobacillus) can help to balance and maintain the intestinal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. 

 

Living and Management

 

This disease is treated and managed in long-term cases by switching your pet to a high in fiber diet, which reduces Clostridium perfringens and enterotoxin production in the intestinal tract. Your veterinarian might also recommend that you supplement your cat's diet with psyllium, a soluble source of fiber. Prebiotic and probiotic diets might also be recommended by your veterinarian in order to try to maintain the normal balance of good bacteria in your cat's intestine.



Fortunately, cats with good immune response will generally fight off the infection easily."," typically last a week in acute cases and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea. Long-term (chronic) cases of clostridial enterotoxicosis, meanwhile, involve recurrences of diarrhea, which may repeat every two to four weeks, and may continue for months to years.



When compared to its incidence in dogs, this is an uncommon condition in cats. Most animals have antibodies that will effectively fight the bacteria and clear it from the body.

514,Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in Cats,"What is Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats?
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency caused by severe complications of diabetes mellitus. 

Diabetes mellitus is caused by a decrease of insulin resulting in the inability of glucose in the bloodstream to move into the cells and tissues of the body. Without glucose, the cells and tissues essentially starve since they have no energy or food source. Although there is a large amount of glucose circulating in the bloodstream, it cannot be utilized without insulin. This is why diabetic patients will show high blood-sugar levels on a glucometer (a measure of high glucose circulating in the bloodstream) because glucose cannot enter the cells where it is needed.   

DKA occurs when a diabetic patient develops a secondary medical condition that places additional stress on the cells and the body. The most common secondary medical conditions include:


	
	Pancreatitis
	
	
	Any infection (most commonly urinary tract infection)
	
	
	Fatty liver (hepatic lipidosis)
	
	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Cancer
	


These conditions increase the body’s energy needs, which causes a spike in glucose demand. At this point, the body becomes desperate for energy and will start breaking down fat to acquire an energy source. 

This process leads to the conversion of fat to ketone bodies, which the cells and tissues can use as an alternative energy source. However, they create pH and electrolyte imbalances that result in acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and dehydration. 

Unless the normal fuel process is quickly restored (insulin providing glucose to the cells instead of ketones), the body will spiral into a metabolic turmoil that can quickly become life threatening.   

Because diabetes often goes undiagnosed in cats, the symptoms of DKA are often the first indication of this underlying condition. A pet can be diabetic (diagnosed or undiagnosed) and not show any symptoms of DKA until a secondary stressor or additional illness develops.

Symptoms of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats
If a known diabetic cat is sick with acute vomiting and/or anorexia, the pet parent should have the cat evaluated by their veterinarian. Clinical signs of diabetic ketoacidosis in cats may include:


	
	Anorexia  
	
	
	Nausea/vomiting  
	
	
	Lethargy/depression/weakness 
	
	
	Increased drinking/increased urinating  
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate which can progress to slow, deep breathing (from acidosis)  
	
	
	Weight loss  
	
	
	Dehydration  
	
	
	Unkempt coat/lack of grooming
	
	
	Sweet smell to the cat’s breath  
	


Causes of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats
DKA occurs when a diabetic patient develops a secondary medical condition that places additional stress on the cells and body. This increases the energy needs of the cell and tissues, which results in the body turning to ketones as an energy source.  Some of the common causes include:  


	
	Unregulated diabetes mellitus (not getting enough insulin) 
	
	
	Pancreatitis
	
	
	Any infection (most commonly urinary tract infection)  
	
	
	Fatty liver (hepatic lipidosis)  
	
	
	Kidney disease  
	
	
	Neoplasia/Cancer  
	
	
	Any other secondary medical condition that increases metabolic needs or stresses the body  
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats
Diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis will begin with a physical examination by your veterinarian. If the pet is a known diabetic, the veterinarian may already be suspicious of DKA. The ketones may also cause a sweet smell to the pet’s breath.   

The veterinarian will want to run bloodwork, including a serum chemistry and complete blood count to assess blood sugar and electrolytes. Urinalysis will be useful to determine if there are signs of glucose and ketones in the urine and to rule out urinary tract infection. Ketones may also be found in the blood serum.   

Once the pet is determined to be diabetic and their blood shows the presence of ketones, the focus moves to determining what disease could be occurring in addition to the diabetes that led to the DKA.  

At this point, the pet will likely be transferred to a 24-hour specialty/emergency hospital for advanced diagnostics and possible hospitalization. The veterinary staff will likely perform an abdominal ultrasound to assess the pancreas for signs of inflammation (pancreatitis), assess the liver, kidneys and other organ systems of signs of disease or tumors.  

Chest X-rays may also be considered to rule out any evidence of pneumonia (source of infection) or metastasis (evidence of cancer). Finally, a blood-gas analysis may be performed to determine the severity of the acidosis.   

Treatment of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats
There are three main goals in treatment of DKA:


	
	Restore hydration through fluids
	
	
	Restore glucose as the main energy source through insulin therapy
	
	
	Stop ketone production, and correct electrolyte abnormalities
	


To accomplish these goals, most cats will require hospitalization for at least a few days but might be hospitalized longer.

Hospitalization of DKA in Cats

An IV catheter will be used to provide IV fluid therapy for rehydration as well as electrolyte replacement. Initially, the patient will receive short-acting insulin and transitioned back to their normal long-acting insulin for discharge and at-home management. Blood sugar and electrolyte levels will be checked frequently during your cat’s hospital stay. Other medications for nausea, vomiting, pain or infection (antibiotics) may also be administered.  

Nutrition for DKA in Cats

One important aspect of DKA management is nutrition. For a diabetic pet to be successful at home they need to eat without vomiting to receive insulin and prevent DKA from recurring.  

In the hospital, blood-sugar levels will be closely monitored and insulin can be adjusted frequently. But at home, cats will need to eat twice per day and receive long-acting insulin.

Since cats often refuse to eat during a hospital stay, it is important a cat eats when transitioning back home to ensure they get their insulin. In some cases, cats with DKA will need a temporary feeding tube to provide nutritional support to help with the transition. Your veterinarian will help you in understanding the type of feeding tube needed, and how to successfully use at home, should your cat need one.

If your cat has previously been free fed, you will want to work with your veterinarian to transition them to meal feedings. If your cat does not eat, please contact your veterinarian immediately to discuss how to proceed with their insulin administration. Giving insulin, if a pet has not eaten without instructions from your veterinarian, can result in low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and seizures.    

Recovery and Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats
Early diagnosis and treatment of DKA are important for best possible outcome and minimal complications; however, most cats will need to remain hospitalized anywhere from two to seven days and placed on IV fluids, anti-nausea medications, electrolyte supplements, IV insulin therapy and other supportive care.

Cats are typically discharged once they are eating on their own with no vomiting and can receive long-acting insulin at home.

Once the immediate concerns and risks associated with DKA have been corrected (including stopping dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and eliminating ketones) the focus shifts to regulating and managing the diabetes mellitus and any concurrent illness.

Long-Term Management of Diabetes in Cats

There is no cure for feline diabetes mellitus, but the prognosis is positive for quality of life. For most cats, this will mean twice daily long-acting insulin administration for life. This is much more likely for cats that do not go into diabetic remission (meaning they are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels without insulin injections).

Long-term diabetes management is individualized for each cat by the veterinarian but it will likely include periodic glucose curves or fructosamine blood tests to ensure that the diabetes is properly regulated.   

Avoiding future DKA involves careful monitoring of your cat at home. If a known diabetic cat is sick with acute vomiting and/or anorexia, take it to a veterinarian immediately.
Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Cats FAQsWhat are the warning signs of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in cats? Warning signs will include consistent vomiting, refusal to eat, increased drinking, consistent urination, weight loss and lethargy.
Can a cat recover from Diabetic Ketoacidosis? Yes. Medication will be used to help with dehydration, nausea and electrolyte imbalances. 

Insulin will be a crucial part of the acute management of DKA and chronic management of diabetes mellitus. A cat can recover from DKA and go back to successful diabetic management.

515,Diabetes Insipidus in Cats,"What is Diabetes Insipidus in Cats?
Diabetes insipidus is an extremely rare condition in cats. The most obvious symptoms of diabetes insipidus in cats are excessive urination and excessive thirst, due to an irregular production or response to ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone). ADH is normally produced in the hypothalamus of the brain and stored in the pituitary gland. Without normal ADH production and response, the kidneys are prevented from reabsorbing water from the bloodstream, forcing the cat to urinate excessively and drink much more water to compensate. 

Diabetes insipidus should not be confused with the much more common diabetes mellitus in cats. Both diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus share the symptoms of excessive thirst and excessive urinating, however the causes of these conditions — including treatment options — vary.

There are two forms of Diabetes Insipidus:


	
	Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): the hypothalamus does not produce any or enough ADH.
	
	
	Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI): the kidneys do not respond appropriately to ADH.
	


Your veterinarian will want to rule out any other conditions before treating diabetes insipidus. Fortunately, some types of diabetes insipidus are treatable, and many cats can lead normal, healthy lives.

Symptoms of Diabetes Insipidus in Cats
The most common symptoms of diabetes insipidus in cats may include:


	
	Excessive thirst
	
	
	Excessive urination
	
	
	Incontinence due to increased and frequent urination
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Possible neurological abnormalities (seizures, disorientation, and incoordination)
	


Causes of Diabetes Insipidus in Cats
There are two main causes for diabetes insipidus in cats which may be treatable, depending on the cause.

Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): A condition that occurs when the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, does not secrete enough ADH, or the pituitary gland is unable to store it properly. Cats with CDI tend to be middle-aged and senior pets. 

Central diabetes insipidus in cats can be caused by a congenital defect, head trauma (such as a car accident or injury), cancer within a specific part of the brain or for reasons unknown.

Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI): A condition that occurs when the kidneys cannot respond appropriately to the ADH secreted by the brain.

Acquired NDI in cats has many causes, and there is no known breed, age, or gender predisposition to secondary NDI. Causes of acquired NDI include:


	
	Medications
	
	
	Diseases such as Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease or pyometra
	
	
	Kidney damage, such as infection, inflammation, urethral blockage or chronic kidney disease
	
	
	Liver disease
	
	
	High calcium
	
	
	Electrolyte abnormalities
	
	
	Leptospirosis infection
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism
	
	
	Idiopathic (unknown)
	


If a cat is diagnosed with NDI a veterinarian will want to treat the underlying condition, if possible, to reverse the condition.  

How Veterinarians Diagnose Diabetes Insipidus in Cats
When diagnosing diabetes insipidus in cats, your veterinarian will start with a physical exam and an extensive history. They will want to run the same lab work and testing that is also ordered to determine the common (but vague) symptoms of excessive urination and excessive thirst in cats. This lab work may include:

 


	
	Blood chemistry
	
	
	Complete blood count
	
	
	Urinalysis with culture
	
	
	ACTH stimulation test
	
	
	Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test
	
	
	Serum bile acids
	
	
	Thyroid function tests
	


This level of lab work in cats will help to rule out a more common condition such as kidney disease, hyperthyroidism or diabetes in cats.

It’s important to note at one time veterinarians ran a water deprivation test to diagnose diabetes insipidus in cats. However, this test led to cats becoming extremely ill—especially those with other serious diseases. Due to the risks shown in previous cases, this test is largely out of favor for diagnosing diabetes insipidus in cats.

Treatment of Diabetes Insipidus in Cats 
Treatment will depend on whether the cat is diagnosed with the CDI or NDI form of diabetes insipidus.

For cats diagnosed with CDI, they can continue to take the Desmopressin for the duration of its life to reduce symptoms. It is important they are allowed 24/7 access to water, and can urinate freely. A veterinarian may recommend additional supportive therapy options.

Pet parents should monitor cats treated with Desmopressin for signs of overhydration, which includes symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, difficulty breathing or changes in mentation.

For cats diagnosed with NDI, it can be cured if the veterinarian is able to treat the primary underlying disease. Keep in mind, there is no cure for NDI of unknown causes, it can only be reversed if the primary disease is identified and treated. If the underlying condition is chronic, it may also trigger NDI relapses.

Medication Treatment for Diabetes Insipidus in Cats

Veterinarians will run a trial test with a drug called Desmopressin. This drug is a synthetic version of ADH that acts a replacement for the hormone. Before the drug is given, urine osmolality, or how many particles are dissolved in the urine and concentration will be measured before the drug is introduced.

After the drug is administered and in the cat’s system, a pet parent will be asked to measure the urine output and water intake from the cat for a few days and continue to monitor its water and urination. Once urine samples are collected by the pet parent, your veterinarian will re-run the urine tests.

A significant decrease in water intake and an increase in urine concentration of more than 50 percent are consistent with a diagnosis of CDI.

Cats with NDI will not improve (which is how the NDI form will be suspected) and more testing may be necessary.

Advanced imaging, such as MRI and CT scans, may also be used to help the vet evaluate the brain for cancer, lesions or trauma.

Recovery and Management of Diabetes Insipidus in Cats
The prognosis for diabetes insipidus is generally good, depending on the underlying disorder.

NDI can be cured, while CDI is usually not curable unless the cause is due to trauma or is only temporary.

Cats can live relatively normal lives with some forms of diabetes insipidus if the side effects of thirst and urination are manageable for the pet parent.

Cats with diabetes insipidus, especially those untreated, must always have access to water. If not, severe dehydration, stupor, coma, and death may occur.

For pets on Desmopressin or other medications, they will most likely require lab work on a regular basis to evaluate kidney function, urine concentration and electrolytes.

516,Diabetes in Dogs and Cats: Everything You Need to Know,"Certain triggers cause us vet types to start thinking in overdrive during our examinations of pets. A seemingly innocent question, like “How’s his appetite? Has he been drinking more or less than usual?” can actually represent a significant clue in our hunt for answers. A dog or cat, for example, who suddenly starts drinking and urinating a ton more than usual is giving us a big hint that something is wrong with its body—and of the several possible causes, diabetes is one that owners seem to dread hearing the most.

As one of the most common health conditions in middle-aged cats and dogs, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is frightening for owners. And it’s true, diabetes is usually a lifelong condition that requires vigilance on the part of owners in order to control. But that also leads to the good news: in many cases it can be managed, and often pets with diabetes continue on to lead long and happy lives.

What is Diabetes in Dogs and Cats?

Diabetes can refer to two unrelated conditions in veterinary medicine: diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), and less common diabetes insipidus (water diabetes). As diabetes insipidus is a much rarer condition with a completely different cause and treatment, this article focuses on the prevalent type of diabetes: diabetes mellitus.

The pancreas is an essential organ; it is here that the beta cells that produce insulin reside. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream to enter the body’s cells to be used as an energy source. Diabetes is a condition caused by a loss or dysfunction of the beta cells of the pancreas. In some cases, the pancreas completely loses the ability to manufacture insulin—insulin deficient diabetes, also described as Type 1 diabetes—and the pet is dependent on external administration of the hormone. In other instances, the pet can manufacture insulin, but the body doesn’t respond to it (insulin resistant diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes.)

While it is assumed that pets are either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetics, that isn’t always the case. Rather than being one or the other, diabetes severity can exist on a spectrum. A recent study published in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine shows that an individual pet’s condition may be more fluid than initially thought. For example, I had learned in school that dogs were almost exclusively Type 1 diabetics, and cats were almost always Type 2. Now we know that isn’t necessarily always the case.

What Causes Diabetes in Dogs and Cats?

There is no one single cause of diabetes in dogs and cats. In some pets, it is a genetic condition; certain breeds such as Australian terriers, Beagles, Samoyeds, and Burmese are at higher risk. Underlying medical conditions such as obesity, pituitary disease, and adrenal disease can predispose a pet to developing diabetes. Medications such as steroids can also induce diabetes in dogs and cats.

What Are the Signs of Diabetes in Dogs and Cats?

No matter the cause, all diabetics have elevated blood sugar that spills over into the urine, causing a predictable array of clinical signs:


	Drinking and urinating much more frequently. The presence of glucose in the urine prevents the kidneys from effectively doing their job re-absorbing water into the bloodstream.
	Increased hunger. Despite the high levels of glucose in the blood, the body can’t utilize it for energy. It’s kind of like sitting at a buffet with your mouth taped shut; there’s food everywhere, but it’s not doing you any good. So the body continues to signal pets to eat more and more to raise blood glucose levels.
	Weight loss. Again, despite the increased appetite, the body can’t do anything with the calories being swallowed, so patients lose weight.
	Additional signs may include vomiting, poor coat condition, cataracts in dogs, and abnormal gait in cats.


Left untreated, diabetes can lead to liver dysfunction and a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. A diabetic pet that is vomiting or disoriented should be evaluated immediately. Without aggressive treatment, diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to brain swelling, kidney failure, pancreatitis, and rapid death.

Next: How is Diabetes Diagnosed in Dogs and Cats?

 

How is Diabetes Diagnosed in Dogs and Cats?

An initial diagnosis of diabetes does not require special testing outside of standard bloodwork and urinalysis. The main criterion in blood testing is an elevated blood glucose, though other abnormalities are also common. A urinalysis is also highly recommended as the presence of glucose in the urine is one of the hallmarks of diabetes.

Additional tests, such as urine culture to check for urinary tract infections, thyroid testing, and/or x-rays, are also commonly ordered to help gain a thorough picture of the pet’s current state of health.

Because diabetes affects every pet differently, and because some pets are more severely ill at the time of diagnosis than others, an accurate assessment is necessary so that your veterinarian can provide the most effective and timely treatment.

How is Diabetes Treated in Dogs and Cats?

In pets with clinical signs of disease, insulin injections are the mainstay of treatment for both dogs and cats. In cats, glargine and PZI are the insulins most commonly used. In dogs, Lente, NPH, and Vetsulin insulins are the first line insulins used in treatment. Each has its pros and cons in terms of how long it lasts in the bloodstream, how easy it is for owners to obtain, and reasonable cost. For those reasons, the most current American Animal Hospital Association Diabetes Management Guidelines suggest multiple options so that veterinarians and owners can select the best insulin for the pet as a team.

While many owners of a newly diagnosed diabetic worry about administering the injections, most adjust quickly. Insulin injections are given twice a day, timed with a meal, and because of the tiny needle size and volume administered, even the most reticent owners learn quickly that pets don’t seem to mind the shots.

How Quickly Do Pets with Diabetes Improve?

Managing a pet’s blood sugar is both an art and a science. Determining the proper insulin dose does not often happen right away; it can take some time before you and your vet arrive at the right amount of insulin. Many factors, such as stress and illness, can cause variances in blood sugar from day to day, so owners who are attempting to monitor their pets’ blood glucose may find it very confusing, especially in the beginning.

Your veterinarian may suggest a glucose curve—that is, testing blood glucose over the course of a day to make sure the prescribed insulin is properly managing the body’s blood sugar. Some veterinarians also monitor fructosamine, a value obtained from a single blood test that gives a “big picture” look at how the blood glucose has been doing over a several week period.

Next: What Role Does Diet Play in Diabetes Management for Pets?

 

What Role Does Diet Play in Diabetes Management for Pets?

Everyone has a story about a friend who changed their cat’s diet and no longer needed insulin. While that isn’t the most common outcome, remission is possible in certain cases. And in any case, nutrition is a key component for managing the symptoms for all diabetics.

Dr. Jennifer Larsen, a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition and Associate Professor of clinical nutrition at the University of California Davis, stresses the importance of an individualized approach. While obesity is a critical risk factor in diabetes, pets of any weight can suffer from diabetes.

“In cats, the loss of body fat can result in remission, while for dogs, improved control (of symptoms) is an important goal,” said Larsen. “Likewise, reversing inappropriate or unwanted weight loss in a thin dog or cat is also important.”

Veterinarians look at two main factors in diabetic diets: the makeup of the diet, and the timing of the feedings.

Dr. Larsen stressed the importance of the timing of meals as much as the amount of the meal itself. “For dogs, feeding management in terms of consistency is important,” says Larsen.

“Since the insulin dose is titrated to the diet, the same amount of the same [food] should be fed at the same times every day.” However, she added that “this appears to be much less important for cats.”

Contrary to common perception, veterinarians do not immediately jump to a new diet in newly diagnosed diabetic pets. Dr. Larson explains that “unless there is a concurrent disease that should be addressed, such as obesity or pancreatitis, and assuming the diet is otherwise appropriate, I usually do not change the diet initially.”

“Ensuring that all of the other aspects of managing a diabetic pet are well controlled is a priority,” says Larsen. For many families, the stress of managing injections and monitoring a pet’s health is challenge enough, and Larsen likes to take a big-picture approach.

Dr. Lisa Weeth, also a board certified veterinary nutritionist, agrees. “While I don’t change the diet initially for canine diabetics, I have found that increasing total dietary fiber does help with managing most cases. It won’t eliminate the need for insulin, but it does help even out the clinical signs throughout the day”

“Avoiding snacks in between meals is important for dogs,” says Weeth. “I have owners either stop treats or confine them to a two hour window after the main meals and account for that in my diet plan.”

High fiber diets are still the mainstay for both dogs and cats. While many people are now advocating a low carbohydrate, high fat and protein diet for diabetics, Larsen urges caution. “These diets are often higher in energy density and not ideal if weight loss is needed, since the volume fed may be too low to satisfy the cat and the owner. Again, an individualized approach is best.”

Weeth also emphasizes the fact that diabetes requirements vary widely depending on the pet and that there is no “one size fits all” approach. Some cats who begin as insulin resistant Type 2 diabetics can progress to insulin deficient Type 1 diabetes over time.

“In Type 1 diabetics, reducing total carb intake or adding fiber may help reduce the insulin dosage, but it doesn’t eliminate the need. For Type 2 diabetics, insulin may be necessary to control the hyperglycemia initially, but if you are able to address the confounding factors (secondary influences), the cat may revert to a non-insulin dependent state for a period of time.”

Diabetes doesn’t have to be an insurmountable problem. Successful management is a team approach with an involved veterinarian and a dedicated and patient owner. If your pet has been recently diagnosed with diabetes, take a deep breath and then get ready to learn some new skills. It’s all worth it.

It’s kind of like sitting at a buffet with your mouth taped shut; there’s food everywhere, but it’s not doing you any good. So the body continues to signal pets to eat more and more to raise blood glucose levels.

517,"Diabetes in Cats: Symptoms, Causes, Risk Factors, Treatment, and Life Expectancy","Diabetes mellitus (commonly referred to as diabetes) is a disease of the endocrine system that results from an insulin deficiency. Either the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or it can’t use the insulin that’s produced.

You may be surprised to find out that cats can have diabetes, too. Here’s a complete guide to diabetes in cats, from symptoms and causes to treatment and life expectancy.

Why Is Insulin So Important?

Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, a small but vital organ located next to the upper segment of the small intestine.

Insulin is necessary for regulating the level of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream and controlling the delivery of glucose to tissues in a cat’s body. When insulin is present and functioning normally, glucose is transported from the blood into the tissues and converted by the cells into energy.

In cats with diabetes mellitus, the transport of glucose from the blood to the tissues is disrupted, resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose) and a state of relative starvation.

Types of Diabetes in Cats

Similar to people, several classifications of diabetes mellitus exist in veterinary medicine.

Type I Diabetes Mellitus

Type I diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-deficient diabetes. This type of diabetes, where the pancreas is unable to produce the level of insulin that the body needs, is rarely seen in cats.

Type II Diabetes Mellitus

Type II diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-resistant or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes mellitus in cats.

Type II diabetes is characterized by a relative insulin deficiency. This means that even though the cat’s pancreas may produce adequate levels of insulin, the tissues are unable to use it for glucose metabolism.

Which Cats Are at Risk for Diabetes?

It is estimated that between 0.5-1% of the general feline population suffers from diabetes, but an increasing number of cats are being diagnosed each year.

Any cat has the potential to develop diabetes throughout their lifetime, but certain breeds, such as the Burmese, have been reported to carry a higher lifetime risk.

Most commonly, diabetes is seen in middle-aged, male indoor cats that are obese.

The most important risk factors for diabetes mellitus in cats are:


	
	Obesity
	
	
	Lack of physical activity
	
	
	Increasing age
	
	
	Gender (males are diagnosed more frequently than females)
	
	
	Castration (being neutered)
	
	
	Glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy
	


Certain medical conditions may also predispose a cat to developing diabetes.

Most Common Signs of Diabetes Mellitus in Cats 

If left untreated, diabetes mellitus can progress to a stage of the disease that is life-threatening for cats. So it’s important for you to know the symptoms of diabetes in cats, and to contact your veterinarian right away if you believe that your cat may be experiencing any of them.


	
	Increased thirst
	
	
	Increase in frequency and volume of urination
	
	
	Urinating outside the litter box
	
	
	Increased appetite
	
	
	Weight loss (despite a hearty appetite)
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Muscle wasting
	
	
	Lethargy or weakness
	
	
	Poor coat quality (oily coat, dandruff)
	
	
	Plantigrade stance (less common)
	


In cases of uncontrolled diabetes, cats may develop damage to the nerves in their hind limbs, which causes a plantigrade stance. Instead of walking on their paws, these cats walk with a “dropped hock,” where their whole foot almost or completely touching the ground. This is a form of diabetic neuropathy.

Unfortunately, many of the symptoms of diabetes in cats are not specific to diabetes alone. So take your cat to your veterinarian to rule out other diseases (such as kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, or pancreatitis).

How Blood Glucose Relates to the Symptoms You See

In all cases of diabetes mellitus (regardless of type), there is an excessive level of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia).

When the blood glucose reaches a certain threshold, it begins to overflow into the urine (glucosuria) and draws large volumes of water out with it. This results in excessive urination (polyuria) and dehydration.

In an effort to combat dehydration, cats often also begin drinking excessive amounts of water (polydipsia). 

Despite the elevated level of glucose in the blood, not enough glucose is transported to the cells, so they become starved for energy.

In response to perceived starvation, a cat’s body begins to break down fat and protein stores for energy, which results in weight loss and cachexia (muscle wasting) in cats. This weight loss often occurs despite the cat having an increased appetite (polyphagia).

How Do Vets Diagnose Feline Diabetes?

Diabetes is diagnosed by the presence of the typical clinical signs in the face of persistent fasting hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose), and glucosuria (glucose in the urine).

This can be diagnosed by performing full bloodwork and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian may also use the blood sample to perform a serum fructosamine, which allows them to prove that the blood glucose has been elevated over time, and not just at the time it was measured in the hospital.

Diabetic Ketoacidosis

Through additional testing, your veterinarian might also find:


	
	Elevated liver enzymes
	
	
	Elevated kidney values
	
	
	The presence of ketones in the blood or urine
	
	
	Electrolyte imbalances
	
	
	Other metabolic disturbances
	


These symptoms may be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

DKA is a form of diabetes in which the cells (which cannot access glucose) use free fatty acids as an energy source. These free fatty acids are broken down into molecules called ketoacids.

As ketoacids and glucose accumulate in the blood, it can become life-threatening for your cat.

Cats that have progressed to a state of DKA have more severe clinical signs, which may include:


	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Anorexia (not eating)
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Progressive weakness or lethargy
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Coma
	


In these cases, your cat needs a full workup, including x-rays and an ultrasound, which will help identify other diseases and diabetic complications.

Treatment of Feline Diabetes

Managing feline diabetes is a lifelong commitment that requires vigilance and good communication between you and your veterinarian.

At the time of diagnosis, your cat may need to be hospitalized for several days until their glucose level is controlled and they are feeling well. If your cat is in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis at the time of diagnosis, they will likely require extended hospital stays and intensive care.

The primary goals of treatment of feline diabetes are centered on:


	
	Restoring normal blood-glucose levels
	
	
	Reducing or eliminating the clinical signs of excess thirst and urination
	
	
	Normalizing weight and appetite
	
	
	Avoiding inducing inappropriately low glucose levels
	


Your veterinarian will develop a plan that is tailored to your cat’s specific needs. If your cat has concurrent diseases, your veterinarian will recommend treatment for those as well.

At-Home Insulin Therapy

The vast majority of cats diagnosed with diabetes mellitus require daily injectable insulin therapy.

Oral diabetic drugs, such as those used in human patients, are typically less effective and prescribed much less frequently for cats.

Blood-Glucose Curve

There are a variety of different insulin preparations available for cats, and each cat responds to insulin therapy differently (some are more sensitive than others).

As such, performing a blood-glucose curve at the time of diagnosis is very important. This is a series of timed blood-glucose measurements taken over the course of a day, most often in the hospital.

A blood-glucose curve will identify the insulin type and dosing frequency that works best to control your cat’s glucose levels, while avoiding periods of inappropriately low glucose (hypoglycemia).

Once an effective treatment plan has been identified, your veterinarian will show you the proper way to administer insulin injections at home. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions closely.

Adjusting Your Cat’s Insulin Dose

Unfortunately, regulating feline diabetes can be complicated, and it’s normal for the vet to make frequent changes to your cat’s treatment plan, especially at the time of diagnosis.

After your cat has been receiving insulin at home for a week or so, they will need to return to the veterinarian to have a glucose curve performed.

Based on your cat’s symptoms and the test results, the insulin dose is adjusted, and the glucose curve is repeated. This cycle continues until your cat has fewer or lessened symptoms and their blood-glucose levels are controlled within an acceptable range.

It may take up to several months to find the right insulin dose to regulate your cat’s diabetes.

Caring for a Diabetic Cat

You will need to do a few tasks consistently to help manage your cat’s diabetes.

Monitoring Your Cat’s Glucose Levels

At-home monitoring of your cat’s blood-glucose levels is important for monitoring your cat’s glycemic control long-term. This typically involves pricking the inside of your cat’s ear and using a glucometer (alpha-trak).

Glucose levels can also be monitored in a less invasive manner, by measuring glucose levels in the urine, although this method is not as accurate as blood measurements.

Not all cats are amenable to blood-glucose monitoring at home. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the method of monitoring that works best for you and your cat.

Monitoring Your Cat’s Insulin Response

One of the most serious risks and potential complication of managing a diabetic cat at home is the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

This can happen to any pet being managed for diabetes at home, even if you give them the appropriate dose (or less than the appropriate dose) prescribed by the veterinarian.

For this reason, it’s important that you strictly follow your veterinarian’s instructions and schedule for feeding and giving insulin, and that you never administer a full dose of insulin to your pet if they are not eating.

Signs of Hypoglycemia in Cats

Hypoglycemia is a serious and potentially life-threatening state that should be treated as an emergency.

Signs of hypoglycemia in cats might include:


	
	Dull mentation or disorientation
	
	
	Profound weakness or lethargy
	
	
	Gastrointestinal signs (vomiting, diarrhea, not eating)
	
	
	Trembling
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	


If you see any of these signs, give your cat a sugary product (corn syrup, maple syrup, honey) and immediately go to an emergency pet hospital.

If your pet is having seizures, try rubbing syrup on their gums, but be cautious of your cat biting you.

Managing Your Cat’s Diet and Weight

Nutrition is a very important part of managing diabetes in cats.

Your veterinarian may recommend a diet change to help regulate your cat’s glucose levels and promote weight loss, as obesity complicates diabetes management.

This often involves switching your cat to a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. There are several diabetic prescription diets on the market for cats, and your veterinarian will work with you to identify a diet plan that is appropriate for your cat.

Once you have identified a nutritional plan that works for your cat, it’s critical that you maintain a strict feeding schedule.

Do NOT change your cat’s diet suddenly without consulting your veterinarian.

Providing Appropriate Exercise

Keeping your cat physically active is another important component of helping your cat achieve a healthy weight. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how you can encourage your cat to be more active.

If taken seriously, and appropriate weight loss is achieved, diabetic cats may even enter diabetic remission, a point where at-home insulin injections are no longer necessary.

Keeping a Daily Log of Your Cat’s Health

You need to keep a daily log of your cat's diet, glucose test results, daily insulin dose, and weekly body weight so you can see trends and recognize when your cat deviates from their regular pattern. Any change in patterns should be brought to your vet’s attention.  

Life Expectancy for Diabetic Cats

Treatment of feline diabetes is a major, life-long commitment requiring significant dedication from all family members. It also requires consistent, open communication with your cat’s veterinarian.

With appropriate veterinary care and at-home management, cats diagnosed with diabetes mellitus can go on to live a healthy and happy life without having their diabetes shorten their life expectancy considerably. In some cases, diabetic cats may even go into remission.

If your cat was diagnosed with other illnesses, this might complicate the regulation of your cat’s diabetes and/or affect your cat’s long-term prognosis.

518,Destruction of the Pituitary Gland in Cats,"Hypopituitarism in Cats

Hypopituitarism is a condition associated with low production of hormones that are produced by the pituitary gland, a small endocrine gland located near the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Several hormones are produced by the pituitary gland, any one or more of which may be lacking. Of these hormones, some of the more clinically significant ones are the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the adrenocorticotropin hormone (produced by the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal cortex), the luteinizing hormone (stimulates secretion of sex steroids), the follicle stimulating hormone (secreted by the gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland), and the growth hormone (GH). Hypopituitarism can also result from the destruction of the pituitary gland by a cancerous, degenerative, or anomalous process.

Symptoms

The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are  lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit. For  example, lack of luteinizing hormones can result in sexual  abnormalities such as abnormally small genitals, and GH deficiency can result in lack of appropriate  growth or dwarfism (typically developed within the first two to three months). If the gland is being affected by cancer or tumor, the cat may  be experiencing pain in its head (with consequential head-pressing), or  visual problems. Other common symptoms include:


    Mental retardation manifested as difficulty in house-breaking
    Thin, hypotonic skin – having less than normal tone or tension, as of the muscles or arteries
    Hair loss on the trunk (alopecia)
    Cutaneous hyperpigmentation – darkening of an area of the skin
    Delayed dental eruption
    Head-pressing due to pain in the head from a tumor


Causes


    Congenital
    Cystic Rathke's pouch – a benign cystic tumor that results from remnants of remaining fetal tissue
    Isolated GH (growth hormone) deficiency
    Pituitary tumor
    Acquired
    Trauma
    Radiotherapy


  

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, growth, behavioral development, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to the head. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood tests are the most reliable method for diagnosis of this condition.

Standard blood test results may show increased levels of eosinophilia (white blood cells), lymphocytosis (disease of the lymph glands), hypophosphatemia (phosphorus deficiency), or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Other laboratory tests will test the levels of hormones in the bloodstream. Your veterinarian will want to have your cat brought in for a morning blood draw in order to measure basal levels of TSH and prolactin. Another blood test, called a dynamic test, measures hormone levels after injection of a hormone stimulating substance. This can be used to check levels of ACTH and GH. The results of these tests generally are the best indicators for hypopituitarism. Visual imaging techniques, primarily using X-ray, can be used to check for the presence of a tumor or cyst in the vicinity of the pituitary gland.

Treatment

Management of hypopituitarism is usually conducted on an outpatient basis. Growth hormone supplements will be administered three times weekly for 4–6 weeks, and repeated if necessary. Tumors of the pituitary gland can be surgically removed in some cases, but the prognosis is generally not favorable.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits in order to monitor your cat's blood and urinary glucose concentration. Growth hormone supplementation will be suspended if glucosuria (an abnormal condition of osmotic diuresis due to excretion of glucose by the kidneys) develops, or if the blood glucose is more than 150 mg/dL.

Your cat's skin and haircoat should improve within 6–8 weeks of initiating growth hormone and thyroid supplementation. Generally, in the case of low GH levels, there is no increase in stature because the growth plates have usually closed by the time a diagnosis has been made. Unfortunately, because many of the hormones that are affected by pituitary disorders are essential for the overall health, the long term prognosis for hypopituitarism is poor.","

The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are  lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit. For  example, lack of luteinizing hormones can result in sexual  abnormalities such as abnormally small genitals, and GH deficiency can result in lack of appropriate  growth or dwarfism (typically developed within the first two to three months).

519,Dental Issues in Cats,"What Are Dental Issues in Cats?
Dental issues in cats are very common and can have serious consequences. According to the Cornell University Feline Health Center, 50-90% of cats older than 4 years of age suffer from some form of dental disease. For cats, tooth infections are one of the top reasons to see your veterinarian each year.

Fortunately, the most common forms of these diseases are preventable or treatable with appropriate dental care and monitoring. Common dental issues in cats include gingivitis, periodontal disease, and tooth resorption. It’s important for your cat to have a yearly physical examination with a veterinarian, since most cats do not show obvious symptoms of dental disease.

It’s equally important for your cat to have routine dental cleanings and oral examinations, done under general anesthesia or heavy sedation. These procedures include dental x-rays, which allow your veterinarian to detect hidden dental disease early in your cat’s life.

Most Common Dental Issues in Cats
Dental disease in cats often starts with a buildup of plaque that hardens and becomes tartar. If the tartar is not removed, it will lead to gingivitis, a painful condition where the gums get inflamed. Gingivitis eventually leads to periodontal disease if left untreated. Cats may lose teeth and be prone to infections that affect other organs in the body. In many cases, dental disease causes a cat to stop eating, which leads to a variety of health problems.

Tartar and Plaque Buildup

Plaque is a thin film that develops on the teeth and is home to thousands of bacteria. Some plaque is removed naturally when cats eat or through actions by the cat’s rough tongue, but without daily tooth-brushing, mineralization occurs. When plaque hardens by absorbing minerals from both the saliva and the gingiva itself, it is called calculus or tartar.

Calculus provides a rough surface that disease-causing bacteria can attach to. Tartar has a rough surface that creates a perfect environment for more plaque to stick to, making dental disease worse.

Gingivitis

Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by an accumulation of plaque. Your cat’s mouth will become red, swollen, and painful. This inflammatory process starts when a thin layer of plaque, which contains bacteria, builds up on the teeth. If this plaque is not removed, the bacteria migrate deeper toward the gumline. The cat’s immune system will respond to these bacteria, leading to inflammation. Gingivitis has also been linked to a number of infectious or systemic diseases, including FeLV, FIV, severe kidney disease, and diabetes.

Luckily for cats that develop gingivitis, the condition is usually reversible. The treatment recommended will depend on how severely your cat is affected, but generally involves:


	
	Brushing your cat’s teeth at home
	
	
	Antibiotics either as a pill or an oral rinse:

	
		
		Clindamycin or Clavamox are common oral medications
		
		
		Vetoquinol Dental Rinse
		
	
	
	
	Having the teeth scaled during a dental cleaning, which requires general anesthesia
	


In severe cases, removing the teeth is the only way to remove the source of inflammation.

Periodontitis

Periodontitis, or periodontal disease, results from the progression of untreated plaque, tartar, and gingivitis. Unlike gingivitis, periodontitis cannot be reversed once it progresses. With periodontitis, the tissue damage is much more severe and affects the gums, the ligaments that attach the tooth to the gums, and the underlying bone. In some cats, periodontal disease can develop as young as 1 year of age. This irreversible damage results in loss of tooth support and, in turn, loss of the tooth as well.

Periodontitis is treated with a thorough cleaning by your veterinarian, both above and below the gumline, while your cat is under anesthesia. It’s important that your vet takes x-rays during the cleaning to determine the extent of bone loss and help decide if any teeth need to be extracted.

Stomatitis

Some cats can develop a severe oral inflammation called stomatitis, or feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS). Stomatitis is a complex condition, and the underlying cause is unknown. One theory is that stomatitis develops from cats having an adverse reaction to their own bacteria and plaque in the mouth. This condition can be painful and cause a substantial decrease in a cat’s quality of life.

Stomatitis is treated with a dental procedure under anesthesia and a variety of medications—such as antibiotics, pain medication, and anti-inflammatories—in addition to oral care at home with daily toothbrushing and an oral rinse. Often with severe stomatitis, partial (all premolars and molars) or full-mouth extractions are performed.

Tooth Resorption

Unlike humans, cats do not develop cavities; they develop resorptive lesions, which are the most frequently seen dental issues in cats. Tooth resorption (also called cervical line lesions or feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions) is a process in which the structure of a tooth breaks down, beginning on the inside and progressing outward to other parts of the tooth. Often the crown of the tooth may be lost, and the tooth root might be covered by the gums.

The cause of tooth resorption is not known, but it is suspected that it is stimulated by inflammation cause by periodontitis and endodontic disease. In most cases of resorption in cats, the affected teeth  need to be extracted surgically by a veterinarian.

Treatment of Dental Issues in Cats
If you suspect your cat has dental disease or is exhibiting signs of mouth pain or discomfort, have them examined by their veterinarian as soon as possible. Depending on the degree of dental disease present, treatment options are highly variable and may include:


	
	Toothbrushing at home
	
	
	Oral medications
	
	
	Dental cleaning
	
	
	X-rays
	
	
	Dental surgery
	


Prevention of Dental Issues in Cats

The best way to prevent gingivitis in cats is to regularly remove plaque buildup by toothbrushing. It is important to use only tooth gel or toothpaste designed specifically for cats, as human products can be toxic to them.

Plaque that remains on the teeth for more than three days turns into a hard material, calculus, that cannot be removed by a toothbrush. If your cat does not allow toothbrushing, try at least to wipe the teeth with a gauze pad every two or three days. Some treats, oral rinses, and dry foods can also help to remove plaque; ask your veterinarian for recommendations.

Adding a supplement to your cat’s water helps to freshen breath, kills germs, and can remove plaque. Your veterinarian might also apply a barrier sealant or recommend a plaque prevention gel.

If your cat has been treated for periodontitis, you will need to continue oral hygiene care at home. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions, which might include:


	
	Daily toothbrushing
	
	
	Dietary changes
	
	
	Plaque prevention gel
	
	
	Oral rinses
	


Frequent (every 6 months to 1 year) preventive teeth cleanings will help to prevent a recurrence of periodontitis and further bone loss. Your veterinarian will help you assess what frequency is right for your cat.

520,Demodectic Mange in Cats (Demodex Mites),"What Is Demodectic Mange in Cats?
Demodicosis, or demodectic mange, is an inflammatory skin disease in cats that can cause itching, excessive ear debris, headshaking, sores, and hair loss. 



It is caused by various types of microscopic Demodex mites that can infect your cat’s skin. There are three types of Demodex mites that affect cats: Demodex gatoi, Demodex cati, and a rare species of Demodex that is not named.



Demodex mites can also affect other animals in your house, but the mites are species specific. This means that Demodex mites that affect your dog can’t transfer to cats and vice versa.

 

Causes of Demodectic Mange in Cats
Demodectic mange is caused by these three types of Demodex mites:


	
	Demodex gatoi. This type is usually seen in healthy cats. They live in the top layer of skin and are contagious to other cats.
	
	
	Demodex cati. These mites usually occur in cats that have a suppressed immune system because of an underlying disease or condition. They can be found in hair follicles and sometimes in the ear canals of affected cats.  
	
	
	A rare and unnamed species of Demodex. This type of Demodex is very rare, but it has been associated with underlying disease. These mites can also be found in hair follicles.
	


Symptoms of Demodectic Mange in Cats
Symptoms that are seen depend upon the species of the mite on your cat. 

Demodex Gatoi Symptoms

The most common symptom of Demodex gatoi is itching/overgrooming, which may lead to hair loss and skin scaling. You may also see crusts and sores on your cat as a result of too much licking and scratching.



Demodex Cati Symptoms

Skin issues from Demodex cati can be confined to one area, or they may be spread all over your cat’s body. Common skin issues include redness, scaling, crusting, and hair loss. The itching may be mild to severe. In some cats, excessive ear debris and ear irritation/headshaking may be the only symptoms. 

Diagnosis of Demodectic Mange in Cats
The diagnosis of demodectic mange involves testing for mites and other steps depending on the findings and the type of mite.



Demodex Gatoi

Demodex gatoi can be diagnosed by using skin scrapings or tape to collect skin and debris that can be examined under a microscope. Fecal testing to look for mites or eggs may also be useful. 

However, Demodex gatoi can be extremely hard to find. If your vet suspects an infection, but can’t locate the actual mites, they may recommend going ahead with treatment. A positive response to treatment would confirm the diagnosis. 



Demodex Cati

Demodex cati is generally easy to find on deep skin scrapings, which are examined using a microscope. The mites may also be found on ear swabs that are examined under a microscope.  

Cats with Demodex cati often have underlying diseases that suppress the immune system. This can include feline viral diseases (FeLV, FIV), cancer, diabetes, or toxoplasmosis. In these cases, your vet should run further diagnostics to determine an underlying cause. 

Treatment of Demodectic Mange in Cats
All species of Demodex mites should respond to the same treatments. Products that are generally effective for the treatment of Demodex in cats include 2% lime sulfur dips weekly for several weeks or at least two applications of Bravecto® or Revolution Plus®. No product is specifically licensed for the treatment of Demodex in cats, but the flea medications are effective.

Because Demodex gatoi is contagious to other cats, all cats that have been exposed to an affected cat should be treated.

Recovery and Management of Demodectic Mange in Cats
Treatments are generally successful at eliminating Demodex gatoi mites, but the itching may persist for several weeks after the mites are dead. 



Your cat’s response to treatment for Demodex cati depends upon identifying and treating any underlying disease that is suppressing your cat’s immune system. 



Demodex mites cannot survive in the environment, so environmental treatment is not necessary. These mites are not contagious to humans or dogs.

Demodex Gatoi Symptoms

The most common symptom of Demodex gatoi is itching/overgrooming, which may lead to hair loss and skin scaling. You may also see crusts and sores on your cat as a result of too much licking and scratching.



Demodex Cati Symptoms

Skin issues from Demodex cati can be confined to one area, or they may be spread all over your cat’s body. Common skin issues include redness, scaling, crusting, and hair loss. The itching may be mild to severe. In some cats, excessive ear debris and ear irritation/headshaking may be the only symptoms.

521,Dementia in Cats,"What Is Dementia in Cats?
Dementia, also known as cognitive dysfunction, is a condition seen in some senior cats that affects their memory, critical thinking, behavior, and reason. This condition is like Alzheimer’s disease in people.

Dementia is commonly referred to as “becoming senile” and can result in some sudden changes in your cat's behavior.

More than a quarter of cats aged 11 to 14 show at least one sign of dementia. It’s even more common as they age, with half of cats over the age of 15 showing signs of cognitive dysfunction.

Dementia is the result of age-related degeneration of the brain and subsequent death of neurons, or the powerhouse cells inside of the brain. These neurons are needed for memory, learning, attention, normal sleep cycles, and spatial awareness, among other things.

There are many other conditions that are common in senior cats that can result in behavior changes that can look like dementia. If you notice any changes in your senior cat’s behavior, visit their veterinarian to rule out common medical conditions affecting older cats. Many of these conditions are manageable with early intervention.

Dementia is not considered a medical emergency. However, if your cat has other signs in addition to behavior changes—such as vomiting, lethargy, or lack of appetite—contact your veterinarian.
Symptoms of dementia in cats include:


	
	Acting disoriented or lost
	
	
	Vocalizing, often at night
	
	
	Staring off into space while looking at a wall or corner
	
	
	Forgetting to eat or drink unless food bowls are put in front of them
	
	
	Going to the bathroom outside the litterbox
	
	
	Changes in sleep cycle, being awake and active in the middle of the night
	
	
	Unusual interactions with other pets or family members (becoming more needy, more reactive, or more aloof)
	
	
	Forgetting that they have just been fed and asking to eat again
	
	
	Poor grooming habits
	
	
	Sleeping more than usual
	


Causes of Dementia in Cats
Cognitive dysfunction occurs when age-related decline causes a buildup of a protein called beta amyloid. As this protein builds up, damage occurs to the brain, and blood flow to the brain is slowed. This results in the death of a cat’s brain neurons.

Neurons are responsible for receiving information and for sending out commands based on that input. When neurons start to break down, it affects the cat's thought process and behavior.

Memory is often affected. Cats may forget when feeding time is or where their litter box is located. They may even find themselves lost in a room, or even in a corner.

Because circadian rhythms are controlled by the brain, sleep patterns are often disrupted by dementia. Your cat may often be awake at night, vocal and confused why everyone is sleeping. They may sleep more during the day to make up for restless nights.

Senior cats of any breed can develop dementia.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Dementia in Cats
Dementia can be tricky to diagnose, so veterinarians rely on ruling out other conditions first.

Behavior changes can have other underlying causes beside cognitive dysfunction. Hyperthyroidism and hypertension can make a senior cat act grumpy toward family members and become more vocal at night.

Chronic kidney disease is common in senior cats and can contribute to urinating outside of their litter box. Arthritis can make cats slow down, sleep more, or struggle to maintain normal grooming habits.

Because there are many other common diseases that could be causing your cat's behavior changes, it’s important for your veterinarian to rule out other conditions before diagnosing dementia.

Your vet will perform a physical exam, looking for any changes in your cat’s overall health. They will also do blood work and may recommend a urinalysis. X-rays or pain medication trials may also be done to see if arthritis or other pain could be contributing to your cat's changes in behavior.

Pay attention to any patterns tied to your cat’s abnormal behavior. It may be helpful to video these episodes to share with your vet.

Treatment of Dementia in Cats
Treatment for dementia in cats is often focused on a combination of environmental enrichment or changes, supplements, and medication.

Enrichment and Environmental Changes for Dementia in Cats

With enrichment, new elements are added to a cat's environment to help with disorientation.

A treat ball can be given to cats that feel like they’re hungry after eating. These toys are made to stimulate the mind while rewarding your cat with treats when they succeed. Like crossword puzzles for older people, they may help to keep the mind stimulated to combat rapid decline of brain function.

You may also want to provide your cat with an automatic feeding bowl. These can provide small meals in the middle of the night for senior cats who find themselves hungry at odd hours.

A night light or a radio playing soft music may help your cat with anxiety caused by disrupted sleep patterns and a quiet home. Your veterinarian may also recommend melatonin in cats experiencing an irregular sleep cycle.

Environmental changes may mean altering your home to minimize your cat’s stress and help them have easier access to their needs.

This may include purchasing a litter box with a low entry point. Creating better access for your cat can help prevent house soiling.

Your cat may benefit from being in a smaller space with access to food, water, and a litter box to minimize their chances of getting disoriented and lost, especially at night.

Supplements for Dementia in Cats

The use of supplements may have some benefit in cats with dementia. SAMe, an antioxidant, may be helpful. CoQ10, omega fatty acids, and Vitamin E may also be recommended.

Supplements containing some of these ingredients like Nordic Naturals® Omega-3 Cat™ and Fera® Fish Oil + Vitamin E are readily available. Some senior diets, like Hill’s® Feline j/d prescription food, contain antioxidants, fatty acids, and joint protectors. Your vet will be able to determine if a supplement addition makes sense based on your cat’s diagnosis.

Veterinary diets fortified with calming milk protein—like Royal Canin® Calm Cat Food—may be prescribed. This protein can also be found in the calming supplements Vetoquinol® Zylkene and Solliquin®.

Calming pheromones can also be placed in the home to reduce stress.

When these changes and supplements aren’t enough, prescription medications may be recommended.

Medications for Dementia in Cats

Gabapentin may be prescribed for anxiety or pain. If your cat has mobility issues in addition to cognitive issues, they may benefit from monthly Solensia™ injections.

Selegiline and propentophylline (Vivitonin®) are also commonly prescribed for patients with cognitive dysfunction. 

Occasionally, anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are also prescribed.

Speak with your vet to see what the best treatment is for your cat.

 Recovery and Management of Dementia in Cats
While there’s no cure for dementia in cats, you can do several things to manage dementia and minimize stress in your cat’s life.


	
	Make sure your senior cat has easy access to all their basic needs (food, water, litterbox)
	
	
	When enriching your cat’s environment, try to avoid making any big changes that could be stressful to them.
	
	
	Cats with dementia may be stuck in their ways and may perceive any change as anxiety-inducing.

	
		
		If you’re introducing something new to help improve their access, consider keeping their old litter box or food bowls where they were. Add newer, easier elements to the space.
		
	
	
	
	Medications or supplements may be helpful for your cat to navigate this time in their lives.
	


Prevention of Dementia in Cats
While there is no clear way to prevent the development of dementia in cats, keeping your senior cat sharp can delay symptoms.

Playing regularly with your cat can be helpful for keeping your cat stimulated. Consider the use of treat puzzles, treat balls, and other interactive games.

Establish a routine for exercise. This will benefit your cat’s mind, joints, and overall wellness. Open the blinds during the day so that your cat can look outside to see what’s happening beyond your home.

522,Degenerative Skin Disorder (Necrolytic Dermatitis) in Cats,"Superficial Necrolytic Dermatitis in Cats

Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is characterized by the deterioration and death of skin cells. High levels of the hormone glucagon in the blood (which stimulates production of blood sugar in response to low blood sugar levels) and deficiencies in amino acids, zinc, and essential fatty acid are believed to play a role in superficial necrolytic dermatitis, either directly or indirectly. Fortunately, this disorder is uncommon in cats.

Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

This skin disorder will generally affect the cat's legs and torso, causing:


    Scabs
    Redness
    Alopecia
    Ulceration
    Scaling 	of skin


Causes

In cats, superficial necrolytic dermatitis has been associated with pancreatic cancer, liver disease, and intestinal lymphoma (cancer of white blood cells in the intestine). Other causes include a nutritional imbalance due to a lack of amino acids or a deficiency in the cat's essential fatty acids and zinc; or metabolic abnormalities caused by high serum glucagon levels, liver dysfunction, or a combination of these conditions.

The skin condition is rarely associated with a glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor, or long-term phenobarbital and phenytoin medication, which is used to treat seizures.

Additionally, superficial necrolytic dermatitis is generally an outward symptom of advanced hepatic disease, or of  coincident hepatic disease and diabetes mellitus.



Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, onset of symptoms, and possible health conditions that might have precipitated this condition.

Some blood tests may return with abnormal results, such as high levels of bile acids in the blood, high plasma glucagon levels, low amino acids, and high insulin. Sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP, excreted in the bile) levels may also increase to abnormal levels in the blood.

X-ray and ultrasound imaging usually are not helpful in diagnosing glucagon. However, an ultrasound may reveal advanced liver disease. Skin biopsies (tissue samples) are crucial for making a correct diagnosis, but only early lesions are useful for an examination.

Treatment

Your veterinarian will treat the underlying disease process if possible, and will prescribe the appropriate medicine to treat the cat's symptoms. Most cats can be treated on an outpatient basis, but in some cases, hospitalized care will be necessary. Outright liver failure should be treated with supportive care.

Cats with glucagon-secreting tumors can be cured with surgery, but the tumors will typically spread quickly, before surgical intervention can reverse their progress. Most of these cases are associated with chronic, irreversible liver disease.

Living and Management

Unfortunately, most cats with this disease will also have a severe internal disease with a poor prognosis. A specially-formulated prescription shampoo can help to remove the crusts and may make your cat feel more comfortable."," and Types

523,Degeneration of the Iris in the Eye in Cats,"Iris Atrophy in Cats



Iris atrophy refers to the degeneration of the iris, the colored part of the eye that surround the black center (or the pupil). This medical condition can affect cats of all ages and breeds, but appears to be more common in cats with blue irises. There is also a secondary type that is due to chronic inflammation or high intraocular pressure resulting from glaucoma.



Symptoms and Types



Vision is not usually affected by iris atrophy, but there may be some sensitivity to light. Other typical symptoms associated with this of disorder include:




	Incomplete pupillary light reflex, accompanied by a normal menace response (the reflex to close the eyes when a finger is stabbed toward the eye)
	Unilateral — may note anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes)
	Irregular, scalloped edge to the pupillary margin
	Thin or absent areas of the iris on transillumination
	Strands of iris occasionally remain, spanning across portions of the pupil
	Holes within the iris stroma — black spots that may resemble additional pupils
	Swelling (edema) of the cornea




Causes




	Normal aging
	Uveitis (inflammation of the uvea portion of the eye)
	Glaucoma




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ophthalmological exam on your cat. The initial goal will be to differentiate iris atrophy from congenital iris anomalies, as there are a variety of other eye issues that can be the cause of the symptoms, such as ris aplasia (failure of the iris to develop normally), iris hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of the iris), iris coloboma (a complete, full-thickness area of lack of development of all layers of the iris), and polycoria (when more than one pupil is present in a single iris within the animal's eye, each with the apparent ability to constrict). 





Treatment



Iris atrophy is not reversible, so much of the treatment is designed to target the underlying disease that has caused it, or to halt the progression of the disease. 



Living and Management



Due to the nature of this medical condition, it is possible that it will continue to progress as your cat ages.

524,Degeneration of the Cornea in Cats,"Corneal Degenerations and Infiltrations in Cats



The cornea is the transparent lining that covers the external front of the eyeball; that is, the iris and the pupil (respectively, the colored area that expands and contracts to allow light in, and the lens that transmits the light and image to the brain – the black center). The cornea is continuous with the white part of the eye, the sclera, which covers the rest of the eyeball. Beneath the cornea and the sclera is a layer of connective tissue that supports the eyeball from inside, called the stroma.



Corneal degeneration is a one-sided or two-sided condition, secondary to other eye (ocular) or body (systemic) disorders. It is characterized by lipid (fat-soluble molecules) or calcium deposits within the corneal stroma, and/or epithelium (tissue composed of layers of cells that line the inner hollow of the eyeball, beneath the stroma). Lipid and calcium deposition can affect cats, but it is rare and typically occurs secondary to metabolic disorders. Corneal degeneration related to metabolic disorder is seen even less frequently than lipid deposits.



Symptoms and Types



This condition causes the cornea to appear rough, with distinct margins where the edge of the cornea meets with the sclera. Associated ocular conditions, such as corneal scars, inflammation of the cornea, or chronic uveitis (long-standing inflammatory disease of the front of the eye), can lead to degeneration of the cornea. If one or more of these conditions have been present, having the cornea checked for further damage would be wise for the prevention of severe and permanent damage.



Causes



One of the main causes of corneal degeneration is lipid (fat) deposits in the supporting structure of the inner eyeball: the stroma and the epithelium. While lipids are a normal part of the body, being, as they are, a principal structure of living cells, hyper deposits of lipids in the tissues can bring about disorders to the system they are inhabiting. Systemic hyperlipoproteinemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of cholesterol and specific lipoprotein particles in the blood plasma, may increase the risk of deposits in the stroma, or may worsen already existing deposits. Hyperlipoproteinemia can be secondary to hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism (chronic production of too much cortisone), pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome (a disorder in which the kidneys are damaged), and liver disease.



Hypercalcemia, a condition that is characterized by the production of too much calcium, can increase the risk of deposits of calcium in the stroma, which can also lead to corneal degeneration. Calcium deposits in the stroma are seen less frequently than lipid deposits.



Other disorders that can affect the cornea and its functionality are hypophosphatemia, an electrolyte irregularity distinguished by too little phosphorus in the blood, and hypervitaminosis D, the production of excess vitamin D.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will look for several indicators before settling on a diagnosis. Your cat's eyes will be coated with fluorescein stain, an orange dye that is viewed in blue light to detect damage to the cornea, or to detect the presence of foreign objects on the surface of the eye. The stain examination may show a corneal ulcer with varying degrees of edema (swelling). The edema, if present, will appear bluish to gray and can vary in size depending on severity, with indistinct margins. The stain would also show the presence of a corneal scar – which would cause some opacity, appearing gray to white depending on severity. Corneal ulceration may be associated with worsening of the disease, and vision may be affected if the disease is in an advanced state. Severe vision impairment may occur if a primary eye disease, such as uveitis, is found to be present.



If the fluorescein stain does not show any abnormalities, your veterinarian will look for corneal stromal weakness (dystrophy), which affects both eyes, often affecting proportional focus. The cornea will be gray to white in appearance, with distinct margins. This disorder does not retain fluorescein stain and is not associated with inflammation of the eye. If an object has entered the eye (inflammatory cell infiltrate) it will cause the cornea to appear gray to white, with indistinct margins; microscopic examination of the corneal cells will reveal white blood cells, the cells that are responsible for defending the body against foreign materials and infection, indicating that organisms are present in the eye.









Treatment



If a disease of the eye is present, your veterinarian will treat the condition accordingly. Lipid and calcium deposits that impair vision or create discomfort to the eye, either from a roughened surface, or from disruption and ulceration of the corneal epithelium, may benefit from a vigorous corneal scraping, or a superficial removal of part of the cornea (keratectomy). These procedures would be followed by medical management, since deposits are likely to recur in patients following superficial keratectomy surgery. Your cat's diet will also be a consideration. If hyperlipoproteinemia is diagnosed, a low-fat diet would be beneficial for hindering further progression. Your veterinarian will advise you on this. Both methods of treatment can be useful for slowing or stopping progression of the disease.



Living and Management



Your doctor will want to monitor your cat's serum cholesterol and triglycerides to assess the effectiveness of dietary management, if that has been recommended as a maintenance strategy. If a primary disease if present, its will be monitored for progression or regression, and treated according to the indications and comfort needs of your pet."," and Types

525,Degeneration of the Cerebellum of the Brain in Cats,"Cerebellar Degeneration in Cats

Cerebellar degeneration in cats is a brain disease that affects a specific area of the brain known as the cerebellum. In cerebellar degeneration, the cells within the cerebellum die, causing neurological symptoms.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of cerebellar degeneration in cats include:


    An      abnormal gait which often appears as a goose-step involving the front legs
    A      broad-based stance
    Swaying
    Muscle      tremors, especially when trying to eat or perform another activity
    Normal      vision with no menace reflex
    Head      tilt
    Lack      of coordination (vestibular ataxia)
    Normal      mental activity
    Abnormal      posturing with head back, front legs rigid and hind legs flexed      (decerebellate posture)
    Progression      of symptoms may or may not occur


Causes

Infection with feline panleukopenia virus either in utero or as a neonate may cause cerebellar degeneration. A genetic predisposition for the condition is seen in dogs and may also be possible in cats.

Diagnosis

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may reveal a smaller than normal cerebellum. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be normal or abnormal depending on the individual cause. Biopsy of the cerebellum is the definitive means of diagnosis.

Routine blood and urine testing may be necessary to rule out other disease conditions which may appear similar.



Treatment

There is no curative treatment, but medications such as amantidine, buspirone, co-enzyme Q10 and acetyl-l-carnitine have shown some promise.

Living and Management

Because of the lack of coordination associated with this condition, restrict the cat’s activity to safe areas of the household where injury cannot occur. Avoid stairs, sharp objects, swimming pools, and other dangers.

Another effect of incoordination in the cat may present as trouble eating.  The cat may require physical aid in eating, though it can continue to eat a normal diet. Nursing care to keep the cat free of urine and feces may also be necessary.

Prevention

To protect your cat and potential offspring from brain disease, avoid vaccinating pregnant queens with modified live virus vaccines, particularly the feline panleukopenia vaccine."," and Types

526,Defect of the Ventricular Septum in Cats,"Ventricular Septal Defect in Cats
 
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an irregular communication in the ventricular septum, the wall that separates the ventricles (the two lower chambers of the heart) from one another. A VSD typically results in blood being diverted, or shunted, from one side of the heart to the other. The direction and volume of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect, the relationship of the pulmonary and systemic blood vessel resistances, and the presence of other anomalies.

Most VSDs in small animals are subaortic (below the aortic valve) and have a right ventricular hole that is beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In addition, most VSDs in cats are small and therefore restrictive (i.e., the difference between left and right ventricular pressures is maintained). Moderate-sized VSDs are only partially restrictive and result in various degrees of high blood pressure in the right ventricle. Large VSDs, meanwhile, have an area that is as large as or larger than the open aortic valve in the left ventricle. They are nonrestrictive, and right ventricular pressure is the same as the body’s blood pressure. Only moderate and large defects impose a pressure load upon the right ventricle. 
 
This is the most common congenital cardiac malformations in cats.
 


Symptoms and Types
 
Cats generally present no symptoms of the defect (asymptomatic); however symptoms commonly associated with ventricular septal defects include:


    Difficulty breathing
    Exercise intolerance
    Fainting
    Cough
    Pale gums (only if pulmonary hypertension causes a right to left shunt)
    Increased rate of heart beat

 


Causes
 
The underlying cause for ventricular septic defects are unknown, though a genetic basis is suspected.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, with a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other concurrent diseases.
 
Imaging techniques like thoracic X-rays may help to detect larger VSDs, which would cause a left (or even a generalized) enlarged heart from the increased flow of blood through the heart. High blood pressure in the lungs, chronic heart failure and right to left shunts may be visualized as well. 
 
A two-dimensional echocardiographic study, which uses sonographic imaging to view the activity of the heart, may demonstrate heart enlargement. The right heart will also be enlarged if the defect is moderate-sized or large, or if there are other heart abnormalities in addition to VSD.
 

Treatment
 
Most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. Large shunts may be surgically repaired during a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with moderate or large shunts may also undergo pulmonary artery banding as a palliative (relieves some discomfort but does not cure the disease) procedure. 
 
Living and Management
 
If your cat  is showing signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), its activity should be restricted. Your doctor may also advise you to impose a strict low sodium diet if your cat is diagnosed with CHF, to minimize pressure on the heart. Cats that are diagnosed with overt CHF are generally given 6 to 18 months to live with medical treatment. If your cat has only a small shunt it may continue to have a normal life span if there are no concurrent disease that are posing a direct threat to its health. 
 
Do not breed your cat if it has been diagnosed with ventricular septal defect, as this defect is thought to be genetically transmitted. Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your cat to follow its progress, retake x-ray and ultrasound images, and adjust any medications or therapies as needed."," and Types

527,Deafness in Cats,"Loss of Hearing in Cats



Deafness can be classified as either a complete or partial hearing loss. If your cat is deaf at birth (congenital), it will be apparent to you when the cat is still at a young age. Cats that have white hair and blue irises appear to be particularly prone to congenital deafness. Some of the breeds that tend to be at highest risk for congenital deafness are white Persians, white Scottish folds, Ragdolls, white cornish rex and Devon rex, white oriental shorthair, white Turkish angora, white Maine coone, and white manx.

 

Symptoms




	Unresponsive to everyday sounds
	Unresponsive to its name
	Unresponsive to the sounds of squeaky toys
	Not woken by a loud noise




Causes




	Conduction (sound waves do not reach the nerves in the ear)
	
		Inflammation of the outer ear and other external ear canal disease (e.g., narrowing of the ear canal, presence of tumors, or ruptured ear drum)
		Inflammation of the middle ear
	
	
	Nerve
	
		Degenerative nerve changes
		Anatomic disorders — poor development (or lack of development) in the part of the ear that contains the nerve receptors used for hearing; the condition leads to fluid buildup in specific areas of the brain and damages the part of the brain involved with hearing
		Tumors or cancer involving the nerves used for hearing
		Inflammatory and infectious diseases — inflammation of the inner ear; inflammatory masses that develop in the middle ear or eustachian tube
		Trauma
	
	
	Toxins and Drugs
	
		Antibiotics
		Antiseptics
		Chemotherapy drugs
		Medications to remove excess fluid from the body
		Heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, or mercury
		Miscellaneous — products used to break down waxy material in the ear canal
	
	
	Other risk factors
	
		Long-term (chronic) inflammation of the outer, middle, or inner ear
		Certain genetic conditions, such as white coat color
	
	




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, including any drugs that may have damaged the ear or caused a chronic ear disease. Early age onset usually suggests birth defects (congenital causes) in predisposed breeds.



On the other hand, brain disease is a slow progressive disease of the cerebral cortex, usually caused by senility or cancer – causing the brain to be unable to register what the ear can hear. Bacterial cultures and hearing tests, such as sensitivity testing of the ear canal, may also be used to diagnose any underlying conditions.





Treatment



Unfortunately, congenital deafness is irreversible. But if the loss of hearing is caused by an inflammation of the outer, middle, or inner ear, medical or surgical approaches may be used to attempt a reversal of the deafness. These two methods, however, are dependent on the extent of an existing disease, results from bacterial cultures, sensitivity test results, and X-ray findings. Conduction problems, in which sound waves do not reach the nerves for hearing, may improve as inflammation of the outer or middle ear are resolved. In some cases hearing aids are an option; they have been used successfully with some animals.



Living and Management



Your cat's physical activity should be reduced to avoid any possible injuries. That is, a deaf animal cannot hear the approach of a car or another animal, so it will need to be limited from outdoor activities. Your cat's immediate indoor environment may also need to be controlled for its own safety and protection, and household members and guests will need to be cautious of alarming or unintentionally hurting the cat.



If your cat is diagnosed with an ear disease, your veterinarian may need to see your cat regularly for treatment, or until the condition is resolved.

528,Dark Spots on the Eye in Cats,"Corneal Sequestrum in Cats



Corneal sequestrum occurs when the cat has dead corneal tissue (or dark spots in the cornea). It usually is caused by chronic corneal ulceration, trauma, or corneal exposure. Corneal sequestrum can affect all breeds, but is more prone in Persian and Himalayan breeds. In cats, it usually begins during their middle-aged years.



Symptoms and Types



The dark spots in your cat's cornea may remain unchanged for long periods of time, and then suddenly get worse. Listed below are some other symptoms your cat may experience:




	Discoloration of the affected corneal area (in one or both eyes), ranging from a translucent golden-brown color (early stages) to an opaque black
	Chronic non-healing corneal ulcer
	Abnormal corneal cell formation, which may cause the area to swell and protrude
	Episodes of feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1)
	Dry eyes
	Eyelid twitches and/or ocular discharge; clear to brownish-black mucus or puss
	Blood in the outer surface of the eye and swelling
	Constriction of the pupil




Causes



The exact cause of the condition is unknown; however, the following is a list of potential risk factors:




	Chronic corneal ulceration
	Chronic irritation
	Ingrown eyelashes or entropion (eyelids fold inward)
	Shortened nose and face conformation (i.e, Persian and Himalayan breeds)
	Incomplete blink
	Dry-eye syndrome
	Tear film disorders
	Feline herpesvirus-1 infection
	Topical drug use (i.e., corticosteroids)
	Recent surgery




Diagnosis




	Corneal perforation/iris has moved — protruding iris is fleshy, and its color ranges from yellow to light brown.
	Corneal pigmentation — rare in cats
	Corneal tumor — a benign tumor occurs at the border of the cornea; it is not typically painful
	Corneal foreign body








Treatment



Treatment will depend on the lesion's depth and the degree of ocular pain for your cat. The blemish may spontaneously separate itself from the surrounding tissue (slough), so timing is important. If you decide to wait to proceed with treatment, supportive care is necessary.



Your veterinarian may try to avoid surgery. If the pain persists for months, however, it could lead to corneal perforation. Therefore, some surgical options include: 




	Lamellar keratectomy, which removes thin layers of the corneal tissue. If performed early, it can rapidly relieve pain and promote faster corneal healing. It may also prevent the lesion from affecting the deeper corneal connective tissue.
	Corneal grafting procedures should be performed if more than 50 percent of the corneal connective tissue has been removed
	Postoperative corneal ulcer management with a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic, atropine ointment, and a tear supplement. 




Living and Management 



If the corneal sequestrum is managed with medications, your pet will need to be examined weekly. This is to watch for complications, such as the lesion separating itself from the surrounding tissue. If your cat undergoes the keratectomy procedure, its eye should be re-evaluated every seven to ten days, or until the corneal defect has healed.



There is also a high probability that the condition may spread to the other eye. Cats which produce small amounts of tears, have thick lesions or those that do not have the pigmented corneal tissue removed, may also have recurring problems with this condition."," and Types

529,Cytauxzoonosis in Cats,"What Is Cytauxzoonosis in Cats?
Cytauxzoonosis is a tick-borne (transmitted by tick bites) parasitic disease caused by Cytauxzoon felis, a protozoal (single-celled) organism that infects the blood cells of cats.

The parasite infects white blood cells in the immune system, causing cells to swell. The swollen cell then blocks or clogs blood vessels throughout the body, resulting in inflammation and damage to tissues and organs. A parasite can also infect red blood cells, resulting in anemia that further damages tissues and organs due to a lack of oxygen.

Geographically, cytauxzoonosis has been reported in South America, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Within the United States, Cytauxzoon felis has been identified primarily in the Central, South-central, Southeastern, and mid-Atlantic regions. Cytauxzoonosis is most diagnosed from April to September, correlating with tick season.

Cytauxzoonosis was first reported in the United States in 1976 and is considered an emergency disease. While it is still uncommon in domestic cats, it is reported to affect up to 79% of wild cats in endemic regions.

Symptoms of Cytauxzoonosis in Cats
Clinical signs of cytauxzoonosis in cats start off minor but can quickly progress to a life-threatening illness. Clinical signs typically become apparent 5 to 14 days after infection.

Some common symptoms include:


	
	Fever (90 percent of cats with cytauxzoonosis will have a fever up to 106°F)
	
	
	Anorexia
	
	
	Vomiting 
	
	
	Depression
	
	
	Lethargy  
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Weakness 
	
	
	Paleness
	
	
	Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes)
	
	
	Abdominal pain (enlargement of liver or spleen)
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Increased heart rate and/or respiratory rate
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	


Causes of Cytauxzoonosis in Cats 
Cytauxzoon felis is spread through tick bites—most commonly the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) or the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). It is commonly referred to as “bobcat fever” because the natural host is the bobcat (Lynx rufus). Most bobcats will not show any signs of illness but serve as asymptomatic carriers that infect the local tick population.

The ticks go on to infect other members of the cat family, wild or domestic. Unfortunately, cytauxzoonosis can be deadly to most other types of cats. Cats cannot transmit cytauxzoonosis to each other but must be bitten by a tick for transmission to occur. Additionally, cats cannot acquire cytauxzoonosis from ingesting a tick; the tick must bite the cat.

Cytauxzoonosis is limited to the cat family and cannot infect humans or dogs.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cytauxzoonosis in Cats
Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination to assess for fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Providing your vet with a detailed history of travel and recent tick exposure can be useful when evaluating for cytauxzoonosis. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis may all be recommended for a baseline evaluation.

Ultimately, the diagnosis will likely be made by identifying the parasitic organism under a microscope from a blood smear (a drop of blood on a slide) or fine-needle aspirate of affected organs (such as liver or spleen). Cytauxzoon felis will appear as a signet-ring-shaped body within the red blood cell. It can look similar to—and occasionally be confused with—other parasites such as Mycoplasma hemofelis or Babesia felis.

Early in the course of the disease, the organism will not be visible in the blood, so repeating the test in 12 to 24 hours is recommended if cytauxzoonosis is suspected.

For confirmation, polymerase chain reaction testing for the presence of the parasite Cytauxzoon felis can be performed on blood or tissue samples.

Treatment of Cytauxzoonosis in Cats
Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are needed for successful management of cytauxzoonosis. Without treatment, the death rate in domestic cats is nearly 100%, but this drops to around 40 percent with early, intensive therapy.

Cats will need to be hospitalized for IV fluids to correct dehydration and any electrolyte abnormalities, as well as initiating supportive care treatments such as anti-nausea or pain medications, blood transfusions, and nutrition (including feeding tubes and appetite stimulants). The current treatment of choice for Cytauxzoon felis is antiprotozoal therapy with atovaquone and azithromycin, which has shown a 50-60% survival rate.

Recovery and Management of Cytauxzoonosis in Cats
Cytauxzoonosis is deadly in cats, and even with intensive care, only 60% will survive. Typically, those who succumb to the disease do so within the first 24 hours of admission to the ICU. Most cats will remain hospitalized for 7 to 10 days on IV fluids, supportive care, and the antiprotozoal protocol (Atovaquone/Azithromycin).

Cats that survive will recover over the next two to three weeks and are expected to return to normal lives. Most cats that survive acute cytauxzoonosis will remain chronically infected, but clinically asymptomatic for life. They will not need to stay on medications but will never completely be clear of the Cytauxzoon felis infection. This makes them a natural reservoir source for tick transmission, similar to the natural host of the bobcat.

Given the role of ticks in the transmission of cytauxzoonosis, monthly flea and tick prevention are highly recommended. If you live in an area of high prevalence of cytauxzoonosis, it is ideal to keep your cat indoors only to minimize exposure and risk.

530,Cyanosis in Cats,"What Is Cyanosis in Cats?
Cyanosis is relatively common in cats and causes discomfort. Cyanosis refers to the lack of oxygen in blood, which causes blue discoloration to the mucous membranes and skin.

Hemoglobin is the part of the blood that normally carries oxygen to the tissues throughout the body. In cats with cyanosis, hemoglobin traveling through blood vessels is deprived of oxygen. Oxygenated blood is red in color and deoxygenated blood is blue, which is why cyanosis causes blue discoloration.

Cyanosis is always a symptom of another underlying health issue, most commonly lung or heart disease, but a variety of health conditions can cause it. Certain congenital (present at birth) heart defects make the condition more likely, since blood can bypass the lungs where it would have received oxygen before it is sent elsewhere in the body.

Toxins, blood clots, and low body temperature (hypothermia) are also possible causes of cyanosis in cats.

Cyanosis in cats is a medical emergency that, if left untreated, is fatal.

Cats experiencing cyanosis need immediate veterinary intervention to improve oxygenation of their blood and prevent serious damage to their organs. This condition typically has a poor prognosis, especially if the underlying cause is heart or lung disease.

Symptoms of Cyanosis in Cats
Symptoms of cyanosis in cats can result in several concerning symptoms, including:


	
	Blue discoloration of the skin, gums, lips, and other mucous membranes
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Weakness
	
	
	Restlessness
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Exercise intolerance
	
	
	Collapse
	


Causes of Cyanosis in Cats
Any disease or condition that decreases oxygen in the blood has the potential to lead to cyanosis in cats. Some of the most common causes include:


	
	Congenital heart defect—Heart defects may not allow the body to receive enough oxygen. Examples of heart defects that may cause cyanosis in cats include patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and atrial septal defects. Cyanosis due to congenital heart defects is most common in young cats.
	
	
	Toxin ingestion—When certain toxins are ingested, hemoglobin loses its ability to carry oxygen throughout the body, resulting in cyanosis. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is an example of a medication that is toxic to cats and can lead to cyanosis.
	
	
	Electrical shock—If a cat chews on an electrical cord, electrical shock may occur, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and difficulty breathing.  
	
	
	Trauma or inflammation—Anything that causes trauma or inflammation to the brain, lungs, or chest cavity can result in cyanosis due to the body’s inability to oxygenate the blood appropriately.
	
	
	Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome—Cats with a flat face have structural differences in their upper airways, such as a narrow trachea, which causes them to have poor oxygenation compared to other cats. Burmese, Persian, and Himalayan cats are predisposed to this condition.
	
	
	Saddle thrombus—When a blood clot gets trapped in a major blood vessel it can cut off circulation to the hind legs, resulting in bluish discoloration to the paw pads.
	
	
	Hypothermia—When a cat’s body temperature reaches dangerously low levels, blood vessels in the limbs constrict to allow more blood to reach vital organs, such as the heart and brain. As a result, the cat’s skin can turn blue in various areas, such as the lips and limbs.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cyanosis in Cats
To diagnose cyanosis in cats, a veterinarian will conduct a physical exam, paying special attention to the color of the mucous membranes and skin, as well as assessing the heart and lungs.

Pet parents should provide a detailed history, including when symptoms started, any pre-existing medical conditions, and a list of any medications the cat is taking.

To measure the amount of oxygen in a cat’s blood, a veterinarian may complete the following tests:


	
	Pulse oximetry—This is a simple, noninvasive test where a special device is placed onto a cat’s ear or in between their paw pads to measure the oxygen in the blood. This number is normally at 100%. Cats with cyanosis have levels less than 90%.
	
	
	Arterial blood gas analysis—A sample of blood is taken from the cat’s artery and a machine identifies how much oxygen is present within the blood.
	


Additional tests, such as imaging and bloodwork, can be done to diagnose the underlying cause of the cyanosis.

Treatment of Cyanosis in Cats
Since cyanosis in cats results from another underlying condition, treatment focuses on management of the underlying condition first. Treatment varies greatly because of this.

The most important treatment is oxygen therapy, which is administered at the veterinary hospital to improve oxygenation of the blood and alleviate any respiratory symptoms that may be present.

Other treatments may include the following:


	
	Thoracentesis—If trauma has occurred, fluid may need to be removed from the chest cavity to allow the cat to breathe more effectively.
	
	
	Surgery—If the cat is diagnosed with a heart defect or a blood clot, surgery may be able to correct the problem and improve oxygenation within the blood.
	
	
	Toxin antidote—If toxin ingestion is suspected, specific medications can be given to counteract its effects. For example, n-acetylcysteine is used for treating acetaminophen toxicity in cats.
	
	
	Diuretics—Medications such as furosemide can be given to remove excess fluid from a cat’s lungs to allow for better oxygenation.
	
	
	Supplemental heat—Cats who have dangerously low body temperatures can be safely warmed at the veterinary hospital using warm blankets and intravenous fluids.
	


Additional treatments may be recommended as deemed appropriate by the veterinarian. Most cats with cyanosis are hospitalized for supportive care.

Recovery and Management of Cyanosis in Cats
Recovery from cyanosis in cats depends on the underlying cause.

For example, if severe heart or lung disease is present, the prognosis is poor and most cats succumb to cyanosis quickly. However, if a cat has ingested acetaminophen, early diagnosis and treatment with antidotes can provide a good prognosis in otherwise healthy cats.

Cats who are sent home after being diagnosed and treated for cyanosis should be monitored closely. Pet parents should follow the veterinarian’s instructions for follow-up care and prescription medications carefully during recovery.

Prevention of Cyanosis in Cats
Many causes of cyanosis in cats are not preventable. Certain conditions, such as congenital heart defects, can only be managed with medications or surgery depending on the severity.

However, certain causes of cyanosis can be prevented. Keeping potential toxins safely out of reach and not allowing cats access to extension cords that can be chewed are important preventative measures.

Overall, regular preventive veterinary care is most important for the  health and well-being of cats. These checkups allow veterinarians to catch any health problems early on so that appropriate treatment can be started before they worsen in severity.

531,Cushing's Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism) in Cats,"What Is Cushing’s Disease in Cats?
Hyperadrenocorticism is commonly referred to as Cushing’s disease. It is uncommon in cats, caused by an excessive production of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is naturally released from the adrenal glands in stressful or fearful situations, and is often referred to as the “stress hormone.” The two adrenal glands are located in the abdomen, near each kidney.

Symptoms of Cushing’s Disease in Cats
Excessive cortisol concentrations can cause a variety of changes, including:


	
	Excessive drinking
	
	
	Excessive urination
	
	
	Increased appetite
	
	
	Recurrent urinary tract infections
	
	
	Enlargement of the abdomen (a “potbellied-pig” appearance)
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Muscle wasting and weakness
	
	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Curling of the ear tips
	
	
	Thin and fragile skin that easily tears
	
	
	Bruising
	


Causes of Cushing’s Disease in Cats
Hyperadrenocorticism is caused by high doses of cortisol-like hormones over a long period of time. Usually, these steroids (for example, prednisone) are used to control chronic conditions like allergies and asthma. Cats are less prone to developing the adverse effects of steroids, so this presentation of hyperadrenocorticism is rare.

Naturally occurring excessive levels of cortisol are also uncommon in cats. This condition is diagnosed in middle-aged and older cats (5–17 years old). Female cats are affected more than males, and domestic short- and longhaired cats more than purebreds.

Cats with hyperadrenocorticism may also have diabetes mellitus. The excessive cortisol from the adrenal glands interferes with the effects of insulin, causing diabetes. In fact, hyperadrenocorticism can make it difficult to regulate insulin dosages for a cat with diabetes.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cushing’s Disease in Cats
Since hyperadrenocorticism is uncommon in cats and does not have a single “direct” test, diagnosis requires repeat blood tests, urine tests, and diagnostic imaging, like x-rays or ultrasounds. Tests used in combination to make the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism include:


	
	Baseline Lab Work: This blood test checks liver and kidney values for function and counts red and white blood cell numbers. This helps to rule out more common causes of the clinical signs, after which more specific tests for hyperadrenocorticism are conducted.
	
	
	Urine Cortisol Measurements: This screening test, performed on multiple urine samples, helps to rule out hyperadrenocorticism. High levels alone do not confirm a diagnosis, so further tests are required to support a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism.
	
	
	ACTH-Stimulation Test: This blood test measures cortisol levels before and after an injection of ACTH, the adrenocorticotropic hormone. An injection of ACTH should cause the body to temporarily increase the production of cortisol, then decrease production once the body’s threshold has been met. Consistently high concentrations of cortisol in these samples usually confirm a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism.
	
	
	Dexamethasone Suppression Test: This blood test measures cortisol levels before and after an injection of dexamethasone, a steroid. The injection should decrease the production of cortisol. High concentrations of cortisol (indicating a lack of suppression) in these samples usually confirm a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism.
	
	
	Imaging: X-rays can show other changes to the liver and/or abdomen that may support a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. An ultrasound helps to determine whether one or both adrenal glands are affected. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cat’s head may show a mass on the pituitary gland, which is responsible for the regulation of hormones from the adrenal glands.
	


Treatment of Cushing’s Disease in Cats
With hyperadrenocorticism, treatment involves a controlled gradual withdrawal of the steroid that is being administered. Alternative drugs will be started if still needed, based on the underlying disease the steroid was treating—for example, to manage allergies or asthma.

With naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism, treatment options vary. Control of the abnormal cortisol levels is obtained by:


	
	Medications: Trilostane is best to suppress cortisol production from the adrenal glands. Tablets are given by mouth once or twice daily and are adjusted according to each cat’s response. Clinical signs may improve only minimally, even after the cortisol level is in a normal range.
	
	
	Surgery: An adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of an adrenal gland. If only one adrenal gland is affected, this may be a good treatment. A hypophysectomy is the surgical removal of the pituitary gland (the regulator of the adrenal glands). This is an extremely difficult surgery that carries very high risks and is provided by only a few specialists.
	
	
	Radiation: Radiation is best for pituitary gland tumors and cats with neurological signs such as stumbling, drooling, and seizures.
	


Recovery and Management of Cushing’s Disease in Cats
Cats with hyperadrenocorticism who respond well to the removal of the offending steroid and receive alternate medications will have an improved quality of life.

Naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism does not have a cure, but it can be managed. Prognosis for cats with hyperadrenocorticism varies greatly and relies on their access and response to treatment. Most cats that can receive therapy have an improved quality of life. Cats with the successful removal of adrenal tumors, if present, have the longest survival times, although the surgery itself has a high complication rate.
Cushing’s Disease in Cats FAQsIs Cushing’s disease fatal in cats?Although hyperadrenocorticism is a serious disease, with appropriate treatment a cat can respond well and may have many months or even years with an excellent quality of life. If the underlying cause is a tumor, the prognosis is worse. When untreated, hyperadrenocorticism can be fatal.

532,Cryptococcosis in Cats,"What is Cryptococcosis in Cats?
Cryptococcosis is a type of fungal infection that occurs when a cat inhales spores from a type of fungus that grows in organic material such as soil, decaying wood, or bird guano (especially droppings from pigeons). Spores also can enter the skin through an open wound.

This infection is caused by either Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection in cats and can spread throughout the body. Once infected, spores can spread to the respiratory tract (nasal cavity), central nervous system, eyes, and skin (mostly over the face and neck).

C. neoformans is found worldwide while C. gattii is native to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and Central and South America.

Symptoms of Cryptococcosis in Cats
Because cats typically inhale the spores through their nose, upper respiratory symptoms are the most common:


	
	Sneezing
	
	
	Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose
	
	
	Polyps in the nasal passages, which may cause difficulty breathing
	
	
	Nasal discharge that may be blood-tinged, yellow, clear, or a combination of mucus and pus
	


Less often, the fungus may infect the lungs and cause coughing and rapid labored breathing. Skin lesions are also commonly seen on cats with this fungal disease, appearing as nodules or papules that can be fluid-filled or firm. Sometimes large ulcers that may drain fluid appear on the skin.

 A cat's central nervous system (CNS) may also be affected by the fungal organism, which may lead to the following symptoms:


	
	Depression
	
	
	Behavioral changes
	
	
	Walking in circles
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Muscular weakness
	


Dilated pupils, even when light is directed at the eyes (which may progress to blindness)

Causes of Cryptococcosis in Cats
Cryptococcosis is caused by spores inhaled from Cryptococcus fungus that can grow in soil, decaying wood, and bird guano (excrement). The spores usually enter the nasal cavity and can spread to the lungs by growing into the surrounding tissues.

The spores can then enter the bloodstream and invade other parts of the body, such as the skin, eyes, central nervous system, lymph nodes, urinary tract, spleen, GI tract, or pancreas.

When cryptococcosis spreads throughout a cat's body, this is referred to as a systemic fungal disease. Multiple organs can be harmed and symptoms can vary based on which organ or organs are affected.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cryptococcosis in Cats
There are different ways to test for cryptococcosis:


	Cytology: The nostril is swapped to obtain a sample of the nasal discharge and examined under a microscope. Alternatively, a sample may be obtained by a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or from urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

	 
	Latex agglutination test: This is an antigen test that detects if there is cryptococcal antigen in a cat's serum or CSF. False positive and false negative test results can occur with this test. Test results are usually available in 2-3 days.

	 
	Fungal culture: This is a sample taken from urine, CSF, tissue or FNA. It may be grown on a culture plate to identify the fungus type. Test results can take about 2 weeks.

	 
	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay: This test detects the presence of a Cryptococcus species from a sample taken from the throat, nostril, trachea, or biopsy of a nasal mass. A rectal swab, fecal sample, whole blood, CSF, or a tissue sample can also be used for this test. It takes about 1-4 days to obtain the results.

	 
	Histopathology: Biopsy samples from tissue, organ, or necropsy specimen can be sectioned and stained to scan for the fungus.


Treatment of Cryptococcosis in Cats
Once a cat is diagnosed with cryptococcosis, a veterinarian will prescribe anti-fungal medication. The type of medication that is prescribed will depend upon the severity of the infection.


	Mild to moderate infections may be treated with fluconazole. This medication is typically a 4-month treatment. Itraconazole may be prescribed instead, which usually requires about 9 months of treatment.

	 
	In more severe cases that have central nervous system involvement or widespread infection, amphotericin B (AMB) along with flucytosine may be prescribed.


AMB is a very effective anti-fungal medication for treating cryptococcosis and it also helps to stimulate a cat's immune system to also fight the infection.

Cats undergoing treatment for cryptococcosis need to be rechecked by a veterinarian monthly. They also may need bloodwork and urine tests done periodically to monitor kidney or liver function, depending upon which treatment is prescribed.

Recovery and Management of Cryptococcosis in Cats
Recovery time varies based on the treatment prescribed. For mild to moderate infections, it can take 4 months with fluconazole or 9 months with itraconazole. For severe cases that involve the central nervous system, amphotericin B and flucytosine are prescribed, but these cases generally have a poor prognosis because the infection is widespread.

The length of treatment is based on cryptococcosis titers (concentrations of antigens). When the titer reaches zero, treatment is discontinued and then titers are done every 3-6 months to check for a relapse of infection. If the titer is unchanged after 2 months of treatment a different treatment plan is prescribed.

Cats generally have a good prognosis if they do not have central nervous system involvement. Between 15% and 20% of cats can have a relapse of infection and need to be treated again.

The best way to reduce risk for infection is to keep cats away from pigeon roosting areas and ideally keep them strictly indoors to reduce the risk for them to breathe in spores from Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii.
Cryptococcosis in Cats FAQsIs cryptococcosis in cats curable?Yes, it can be if the infection is treated quickly, and it does not cause neurologic involvement. Some cats can relapse and need to be treated again for cryptococcosis.
Can humans get cryptococcosis from cats? No, humans cannot contract cryptococcosis from cats.
 Is cryptococcosis in cats fatal?Potentially, yes. If a Cryptococcus species penetrates a cat's central nervous system or affects multiple organs, then cryptococcosis can be fatal.
Is cryptococcosis in cats contagious? No cats cannot transmit cryptococcosis to other cats. The spores of the fungus must be inhaled from the environment.

Because cats typically inhale the spores through their nose, upper respiratory symptoms are the most common:


	
	Sneezing
	
	
	Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose
	
	
	Polyps in the nasal passages, which may cause difficulty breathing
	
	
	Nasal discharge that may be blood-tinged, yellow, clear, or a combination of mucus and pus
	


Less often, the fungus may infect the lungs and cause coughing and rapid labored breathing. Skin lesions are also commonly seen on cats with this fungal disease, appearing as nodules or papules that can be fluid-filled or firm. Sometimes large ulcers that may drain fluid appear on the skin.

 A cat's central nervous system (CNS) may also be affected by the fungal organism, which may lead to the following symptoms:


	
	Depression
	
	
	Behavioral changes
	
	
	Walking in circles
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Muscular weakness

533,Corneal Ulcers in Cats,"What Are Corneal Ulcers in Cats?
The cornea is the clear outer membrane that protects the front of the eyeball. It is made up of three layers that are all transparent.

When one or more of these layers is damaged structurally, such as a hole or a scratch, it’s known as a corneal ulcer. It can also be called a corneal abrasion or erosion.

There are varying levels of severity with corneal ulcers in cats, classified to their depths and severity.

Symptoms of Corneal Ulcers in Cats
Corneal ulcers in cats are very painful.

Symptoms and signs of a cat corneal ulcer include:


	
	Rubbing the affected eye with their paw or against furniture or the floor
	
	
	Redness (can be difficult to notice because they will keep their eye squinted)
	
	
	Squinting/tightly shutting their eye
	
	
	Eye discharge may or may not be present
	


Causes of Corneal Ulcers in Cats
Trauma in one form or another is the cause of most corneal ulcers. Trauma can look like a foreign body in the eye, or it can be something much more innocuous.

Tear-production conditions and eyelid abnormalities can also be responsible for corneal ulcers in cats.

How Vets Diagnose Corneal Ulcers in Cats
After the veterinarian’s physical exam and close ophthalmic and neurological exams, the veterinarian will conduct a few tests for the eye.

One test measures tear production, called a Schirmer tear test. The intraocular pressure will also be checked. Tear test breakup team (the rate which the tear film evaporates) may also be checked.

The fluorescein dye application (a fluorescent dye) will be the most effective test at your vet visit when a corneal ulcer is to be blamed for your cat’s squinting eye. With this test, a special dye will be applied, taken up by certain layers of the cornea, and gently flushed out.

The veterinarian will then be able to see if any dye remains as it glows neon green. They will likely be happy to show you the bright green glow, so you can see the corneal scar with your own eyes.

For complex ulcers, advanced samples may be needed for examination.

Treatment for Corneal Ulcers in Cats
The goal of treatment is to stop the loss of the corneal cells and prevent the cornea from further rupturing. Eliminating pain is also a cornerstone of treatment.



Other therapies are aimed at encouraging the cornea to repopulate the damaged cells while minimizing scarring. The topical application of the cat’s own serum (this will be prepared in-house just for your cat) is often helpful to encourage healing.

Any concurrent infection must also be treated. The application of medications will be several times a day in all likelihood.

If the ulcer is complex, surgery may be recommended to promote healing. Many of these procedures can be done by your primary care veterinarian. If the ulcer exceeds 50% or more of the depth of the cornea, or if the ulcer is nonresponsive to treatment, referral to a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist is recommended. Surgery may be necessary.

Recovery and Management of Corneal Ulcers in Cats
Rechecks for corneal ulcers in cats are crucial; if a simple corneal ulcer is not improving in five days, it becomes classified as a complex ulcer, and treatment must ramp up accordingly. Because this is such a short time frame, your veterinarian will likely want to do the first recheck before this period is over.

A recheck within two to three days is not uncommon to ensure the ulcer is improving.
Corneal Ulcers in Cats FAQsCan a cat eye ulcer heal on its own?No. Without treatment, corneal ulcers are at risk for rapidly worsening, and they can “melt” away the affected part of the cornea.
How long does it take for a corneal ulcer to heal in cats?Depending upon severity, one to eight weeks after being treated by a vet. They will not heal on their own.
What does a corneal ulcer look like in a cat?Your cat will have a reddened, painful eye and will be squinting or rubbing at their eye.

534,Corneal Inflammation (Eosinophilic Keratitis) in Cats,"Eosinophilic Keratitis in Cats



Feline eosinophilic keratitis/keratoconjunctivitis (FEK) refers to an immune-mediated inflammation of the cornea -- the external coating of the eye. This medical condition can also be referred to as proliferative keratitis – where keratitis is the clinical term for inflammation of the cornea, and proliferative refers to the rapid and excessive nature of the inflammation of the cornea. Cats that are experiencing this inflammation do not generally experience pain, although there can be some discomfort. The inflammation can occur in one or both eyes.



Symptoms and Types




	Unilateral or bilateral (in one or both eyes)
	Usually little to no pain in the eye despite the inflammation
	Watery to thick mucus discharge from the eye
	Thickening and hyperemia (engorged with blood) of the third eyelid




Causes



The exact causes are unknown, but it is thought that the Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) may be associated with this inflammation.



Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will want to rule out the following medical conditions prior to diagnosing keratitis:




	Chronic corneal ulceration with secondary corneal vascularization (granulation tissue)
	Feline herpesvirus-1 stromal keratitis, which can appear similar to FEK but causes more severe pain within the eye; feline herpesvirus-1 lacks the proliferative component (i.e., the excessive inflammation and tendency to spread quickly), and corneal ulceration is usually present
	Corneal neoplasia (growth of tissue on cornea), which may be one of two types
	Lymphoma - concurrent conjunctival, and/or uveal (middle of the eye) infiltration is common
	Squamous cell carcinoma - rarely involves the cornea in cats
	Chlamydia psittaci - usually a conjunctival disease only; corneal involvement is rare
	Mycoplasma felis - usually a conjunctival disease only; corneal involvement is rare






Treatment



Treatment for this inflammation is usually done on an outpatient basis. There are a variety of topical medications that your veterinarian may be able prescribe to alleviate the symptoms.



Living and Management



Most cats will respond quickly to effective treatment, though it may take several days to several months for the cat to completely recover from the medical condition."," and Types




	Unilateral or bilateral (in one or both eyes)
	Usually little to no pain in the eye despite the inflammation

535,Corneal Disease (Inherited) in Cats,"Corneal Dystrophies in Cats

Corneal dystrophy is an inherited progressive condition which affects both eyes, often in the same way. The cornea, the clear outer layer of the front of the eye, is most affected. The disease is not associated with other diseases, and only rarely occurs in cats.

There are three types of corneal dystrophy, categorized by location: epithelial corneal dystrophy, where cell formation is affected; stromal corneal dystrophy, where the cornea will become cloudy; and endothelial corneal dystrophy, where the cells of the lining of the cornea are affected.

Symptoms and Types

Epithelial 	corneal dystrophy:

    Possible 		corneal spasms
    Vision 		is normal
    White 		or gray circular or irregular opacities or rings on cornea
    Age 		of onset six months to six years
    Slow 		progression

Stromal 	corneal dystrophy:

    Vision 		usually normal, although it may be reduced with advanced diffuse 		opacity
    There 		may be oval or circular opacities: white, gray or silver
    
        Diffuse 			opacity
        Annular 			(doughnut-shaped) opacity
    
    

Endothelial 	corneal dystrophy:

    There 		is a swelling of the cornea with fluid blisters developing on the 		cornea
    Vision 		may be impaired with advanced disease
    Affects 		young animals

Cats breeds that are predisposed:

    Domestic 			shorthairs
    Manx 			(has been found to inherit a similar condition that occurs without the endothelial 			consequences)


Causes

Epithelial

    Degenerative 		or innate abnormalities of the cornea

Stromal

    An 		innate abnormality of the cornea

Endothelial

    Degeneration 		of the lining of the cornea


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including an ophthalmic exam. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.

Slit lamp microscopy will aid significantly in differentiating the type of corneal dystrophy present, and a fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions, and to define the shape of the cornea so that your veterinarian can diagnose the corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye enables visualization of any corneal ulcers that may be present; these types of ulcers occur with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye is inconsistent in its ability to aid in diagnosis of endothelial corneal dystrophy, and is not of much use in the diagnosis of stromal corneal dystrophy, but it can be helpful in the diagnosis of epithelial corneal dystrophy. A tonometer will be used to measure the interior pressure in your cat’s eyes so as to rule out glaucoma as a possible cause of corneal swelling.



Treatment

If your cat has corneal ulcers, they will treated with antibiotic eye medications. Stromal corneal dystrophy usually does not require treatment. Endothelial corneal dystrophy may be treated using contact lenses over your cat's eyes. Also, epithelial corneal tags may be removed. Another possible treatment for endothelial corneal dystrophy is flap surgery of the conjunctiva (the lining of the eyeball and the back surface of the lids). While a corneal transplant may be beneficial, results are inconsistent.

Living and Management

Your cat will probably always have some cloudiness to its eyes after treatment.  However, if you notice that your cat is in pain due to its eyes (e.g., blinking, watering of the eyes) contact your veterinarian, as ulcers may be developing on the cornea. This is prevalent with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy.  Your cat’s vision will most probably remain normal despite corneal dystrophy."," and Types

536,Conjunctivitis in Cats (Cat Pink Eye),"What Is Conjunctivitis in Cats? 
Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the eye’s conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane that lines a cat’s upper and lower eyelids, their third eyelid, and the globe of their eye (the eyeball). 

Conjunctivitis in cats often occurs acutely (as a short-term condition) and is considered painful. It is one of the most common eye diseases affecting cats.

 

Symptoms of Conjunctivitis in Cats 
Signs of conjunctivitis in cats can range from mild redness around the eyes to much more severe disease: 


	
	The conjunctival tissues can be inflamed and swollen, causing excessive blinking, squinting, and the inability to fully open and close the eye. 
	
	
	There may be clear discharge, mucous, or bloody material coming from the eye. 
	



	
	The eyes and the skin around them may be itchy or losing hair. 
	


In addition to seeing symptoms in your cat’s eyes, it’s also common to see signs of an upper respiratory infection. These include: 


	
	Sneezing
	
	
	Nasal discharge (clear or thick mucus) 
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Less energy
	


Causes of Conjunctivitis in Cats 
There are many possible causes of conjunctivitis. To determine a formal diagnosis, veterinarians must first break cases down into infectious or noninfectious. 

Infectious causes include:  

Viral Conjunctivitis—Most cases of conjunctivitis in cats are viral. 


	Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) is the most common cause of conjunctivitis, especially chronic or recurrent cases. The virus hides in the nervous system and activates at times of stress or illness. It’s similar to the human herpesvirus-1, but this family of viruses is species-specific, so FHV-1 cannot infect humans. It is, however, highly contagious to other cats in close contact. 
	Calicivirus is another common virus. It’s primarily shed in nose, eye, and mouth secretions, though it can be found in other body fluids. It is also spread via close contact. While many cats recover, others will become lifelong carriers.


Bacterial Conjunctivitis—Frequently, cats with viral conjunctivitis will experience a secondary bacterial infection. But bacteria can be the primary pathogen as well, although bacterial conjunctivitis is less frequent than viral. The most common pathogens are: 


	Chlamydophila felis 
	Mycoplasma 
	Staphylococcus 
	Streptococcus 
	Bartonella 
	Pseudomonas species 


Note that C. felis can cross species, although this is not common, humans (particularly those with compromised immune systems) can catch it from infected cats. 

Parasitic Conjunctivitis—Outdoor cats are more prone to parasitic infections, which usually cause more systemic disease but can also cause conjunctivitis. These include: 


	Leishmaniasis 
	Thelaziasis 
	Onchocerciasis 


Humans may be susceptible to all three of these, but direct transmission is rare. It is important to be aware of any possible cross-species potential and talk to human-health professionals about any concerns. 

Noninfectious causes of conjunctivitis include:  

Immune-mediated—This uncommon cause of conjunctivitis involves a cat’s immune system attacking itself. 


	Eosinophilic conjunctivitis is idiopathic in origin, meaning veterinarians don’t know why it occurs. However, it may have a link to FHV-1. It causes an infiltration of a certain type of white blood cell to the conjunctiva, causing the inflammation. 
	Lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis occurs when lipids (fats) are deposited along the eyelid margin, glands, and ducts. Veterinarians are uncertain of the cause of this disease. 
	
	Allergies are a cause of conjunctivitis for many cats. They can come from the environment (dust, pollen, weeds, mites, fleas, etc.) or in food. 
	
	
	Physical irritants can range from foreign bodies like grass, sticks, or eyelashes, to harder-to-diagnose irritants like dust, chemicals, smoke, and eye ointments. 
	



	
	Ocular diseases—such as ulcers, glaucoma, eye tumors, or eyelid malformations—can cause secondary conjunctivitis. 
	
	
	Eyelid diseases—such as abnormal eyelid anatomy or cancer—involve frictional irritation or exposure and may cause conjunctivitis. 
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Pink Eye 
Your veterinarian will conduct a complete ophthalmic examination, including: 


	
	A careful eye exam using special instruments and stains to look for other diseases in the eye. 
	
	
	A Schirmer Tear Test is used to assess your cat’s natural tear production by determining the amount of tears produced. 
	
	
	A fluorescein stain test, which is critical to diagnose corneal ulcers. The cornea is the clear dome-like exterior of the eye. With eye and eyelid issues, cats commonly have ulcers or scratches on the cornea. The fluorescein stain allows an ulcer to glow bright green under a black light. 
	
	
	A test of intraocular pressures to look for inflammation or glaucoma. 
	
	
	Blood tests specifically looking for two viruses: feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus. Cats with either virus are immunocompromised and therefore more susceptible to infections. 
	
	
	Blood tests to look for signs of infection and overall organ function. 
	
	
	Radiographs to assess lung pathology, as cats with conjunctivitis frequently have respiratory infections. 
	
	
	Additional tests may include PCR, virus isolation, immunofluorescence antibody testing, and serology to test for other specific bacterial and viral infections. 
	


Treatment for Conjunctivitis in Cats 
The goal of treatment for cat pink eye is eliminating the pain and the infection, as well as treating the underlying cause, if there is one. 

Topical eye drops or ointment may be prescribed, along with topical medications for inflammation and pain. 

When needed, immune-suppressive drugs are prescribed for immune-mediated cases. 

Your veterinarian will go over the proper application of all eye medications, as great care is necessary to avoid further damage to your cat’s eye.

Any other infections will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. 

Recovery and Management of Cat Pink Eye 
Most cases of simple conjunctivitis in cats resolve relatively smoothly with seven to 10 days of topical therapy. 

Longer treatment is warranted for certain infectious agents, and for immune-mediated cases. When complications arise, such as corneal ulceration or sequestration, outpatient surgery may be necessary.

A common cause of conjunctivitis in cats from both rescue and breeder backgrounds is herpesvirus. Herpes infections are sporadic and often first show up during kittenhood. 

Many cats are infected with FHV-1 and do not show any signs of clinical illness. In most cases, herpesvirus conjunctivitis is self-limiting and will resolve within two weeks, though the conjunctivitis should still be treated. 

With cases of herpesvirus conjunctivitis, the signs often appear suddenly and are especially common after stressful situations such as travel, boarding, surgery, or illness. 

When cats do have a flare-up, they are more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, which can be concerning for young kittens.

Prevention of Conjunctivitis in Cats 

Introducing probiotics and maintaining a stress-free environment for your cat can help to prevent viral conjunctivitis flare-ups in cats. Some products your vet may recommend include: 


	Fortiflora™ is a probiotic product made by Purina, can decrease the severity of herpes conjunctivitis by utilizing “good” bacteria in the body. 
	Lysine is an amino acid that supports the immune and respiratory system in cats. 
	Hyaluronate-containing tear ointments or supplements can provide lubrication and support overall proper health of the eye’s tear and glands. Healthy tear films will better clear and manage infections—and the inflammatory issues associated with them. 


Good environmental hygiene, a low number of cats in the home, decreased stress, and early veterinary intervention are also helpful in preventing conjunctivitis in cats. 


	For multi-cat households, Feliway™ is an effective tool that utilizes pheromones to decrease stress, and therefore decrease the chances of the reappearance of viral conjunctivitis. 
	A Thundershirt™ can help cats with anxiety by using calming, gentle pressure, similar to swaddling a baby. 
	Prozac and similar prescription medications may be helpful for cats who suffer from more severe anxiety. 


While there is no cure for most causes of conjunctivitis in cats, there are many treatments and solutions to effectively manage the condition and allow cats to live their best life.

537,Congenital Heart Defect (Pulmonic Stenosis) in Cats,"Pulmonic Stenosis in Cats
 
Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital (present at birth) defect characterized by the narrowing and obstruction of blood through the heart's pulmonary valve, which connects the right ventricle (one of the heart's four chambers) to the pulmonary artery. Depending on the severity of the obstruction, it can cause anything from a murmur to an arrhythmia to congestive heart failure. However, it is rather uncommon in cats, especially as an isolated defect.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
There are three types of pulmonic stenosis: valvular pulmonic stenosis (occurring in the valve), subvalvular pulmonic stenosis (occurring below the valve, and supravalvular pulmonic stenosis (just inside the pulmonary artery). Valvular pulmonic stenosis is the most common form seen in cats.
 
If the stenosis is mild, no clinical symptoms may be present, whereas severely affected patients may collapse with exertion or suffer from congestive heart failure (CHF). Other visible signs of pulmonic stenosis include:



    Abdominal distention
    Difficulty breathing
    Inability to exercise normally

 
Causes 
 
Congenital (present at birth).
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal. Some cats may also be revealed to have polycthemia, a condition which causes an abnormally high number of red blood cells.

Other diagnositc procedures include thoracic X-rays (which may show heart enlargement), abdominal X-rays (which may show abnormal accumulation fluid in abdominal cavity (ascites), and echocardiography (which may show increase in size of right ventricle and other abnormalities related to ventricle). A more advanced version of echocardiography, Doppler Echocardiography, may be used to measure the speed of blood flow. Angiography, on the other hand, is an imaging technique used to visualize the inside of blood vessels and heart chambers, which can help identify the precise structural abnormalities before surgery.


 


Treatment
 
The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the severity of the valve obstruction. If the cat undergoes congestive heart failure (CHF), it will require immediate hospitalization. Balloon catheter dilation is relatively safe and common procedure that involves passing a catheter at the site of obstruction and inflating a balloon to dilate the obstruction. A more advanced surgical technique involves incising the obstructed cardiac valve to relieve the obstruction (valvuloplasty). However, the prevalence of complications and mortalities are much higher with this technique as compared to performing a balloon catheter dilation.
 
Living and Management
 
If long-term treatment is required, you must follow all the veterinarian's instructions and administer medication at the proper dosage and time. The cat will also need to rest in a stress-free environment -- away from children, pets, and noise -- to avoid putting undue stress on the heart. Diet restrictions often involve restricting foods with high salt content.
 
Cats with a mild form of pulmonic stenosis can life a normal lifespan, whereas patients with moderate and severe forms of the disorder have a more guarded prognosis, especially if congestive heart failure (CHF) has developed.
 
In addition, due to the genetic nature of this disorder, your veterinarian will typically recommend against breeding cats with pulmonic stenosis."," and Types

Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital malformation of the heart in which the opening of the tricuspid valve (on the right side of the heart, between the right atrium and the right ventricle) is displaced toward the apex of the right ventricle of the heart. It is accompanied by various degrees of tricuspid insufficiency, such as stenosis – an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel, or rapid heart rhythms caused by an abnormal accessory pathway. A murmur can be detected with a stethoscope in young animals, though it can be much more difficult to hear irregular heart movements if there is stenosis. There is no breed or gender predilection toward this abnormality in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Cats 	with mild tricuspid insufficiency or stenosis will typically be 	asymptomatic.
    Moderate 	insufficiency, or stenosis, will often show as an intolerance for 	exercise
    Severe 	insufficiency, or stenosis, will lead to congestive heart failure 	(CHF), with fluid in the chest or abdomen (swelling in the abdomen 	or chest may also be observed)
    There 	may be some fatigue or dizziness associated with this condition, due 	to increased pressure on the heart to function


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms.

Your veterinarian will order an x-ray of the chest, and will look for evidence of right atrial and ventricular enlargement, as well as an enlarged kidney. Echocardiography can also be used to examine the heart and chest, by showing an ultrasound image of the size, motion and composition of the heart and surrounding structure. An electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity and pressure within the heart will be necessary for verifying a definitive diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly.

  

Treatment

There is no cure for Ebstein's anomaly, so medical management is the only practical approach available. Surgical replacement of the tricuspid valve can be successfully performed at some institutions. Your veterinarian can counsel you on the potential benefits of such an operation, and where you can go for medical care. If right heart failure develops sodium intake will need to be reduced. There are some medications for treating this disease, you will need to work closely with your veterinarian to work out a treatment and medication plan that is appropriate for your cat.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for monitoring your cat's progress. As part of the ongoing after care, echocardiogram images will need to be taken from time to time to measure your cat's condition and to adjust treatment methods accordingly, and activity will be encouraged for strengthening the heart. Your veterinarian can advise you on what activities will be best for your cat."," and Types

539,Congenital Heart Defect (Atrial Septal Defect) in Cats,"Atrial Septal Defect in Cats

ASD, also known as atrial septal defect, is a congenital heart anomaly that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum (the separating wall). Typically, the blood will shunt into the right atrium, causing a volume overload to the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary vasculature, which can sometimes lead to pulmonary hypertension. However, if right-sided pressures are too high, shunting may occur right to left, causing generalized cyanosis.

ASD is more common in cats (9 percent of congenital heart defects) than dogs (0.7 percent), though a recent study from France suggests a higher incidence, with ASD accounting for 37.7 percent of congenital cardiac defects in pooled data from dogs and cats.

Symptoms and Types

ASD occurs in one of three locations: lower atrial septum (ostium primum defect, which is the most common), near the fossa ovalis (ostium secundum defect), or craniodorsal to the fossa ovalis (sinus venous defect). Common signs associated with ASD include:


    Exercise 	intolerance
    Fainting/loss 	of consciousness (syncope)
    Trouble 	breathing (dyspnea)
    Coughing
    Heart 	murmur
    Bluish 	skin (cyanosis)
    Fluid 	buildup in the abdomen (ascites) if right-sided heart failure 	develops 


Causes

The underlying cause of atrial septal defect is currently unknown.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel.

X-rays and electrocardiograms will typically show right-sided heart and lung vessel enlargement in patients with large defects, while an echocardiogram may reveal right atrial and right ventricular dilation and the actual hole (a septal dropout). Arrhythmias and intraventricular conduction disturbances may also be visible using these diagnostic procedures. To document the blood flow through the hole and high ejection velocity through the pulmonary artery, doppler echocardiography is useful.

  

Treatment

Cats with congestive heart failure should be hospitalized until they are stable. Open heart surgery may be necessary to repair the defect, but this is often very expensive. Consult with your veterinarian the best and most affordable course of treatment for you and your pet. For some secundum-type defects, an amplatzer device may be implanted to close the hole.

Living and Management

The prognosis in cats with ASD depends on the size of the defect and coexisting abnormalities, though it is often guarded to poor. Small, isolated defects, for example, are unlikely to progress, while primum-type defects are typically larger with a worse prognosis."," and Types

540,Common Cat Skin Conditions,"A cat’s skin acts as a barrier between their body and the outside world. If a cat has a skin condition, that barrier can be impaired. It weakens their body’s defenses, and in many cases, generates a severe amount of discomfort.

Since a cat’s skin is one of the few organs we can see pretty easily with the naked eye, cat skin disease is easy to spot. However, there are hundreds of causes of skin disease in cats, so the only way to know for sure is by taking your cat to the vet.

Cat Skin Conditions: Signs and Possible Causes

A bump, a rash, a scab, a patch—there are almost as many words to describe cat skin disorders as there are skin issues themselves. Unfortunately, the way a particular skin disease shows up does not neatly align with the underlying cause. That’s why it’s not usually possible for a vet to make a diagnosis based on just a picture of your cat’s skin.

And to further complicate things, there’s usually more than one symptom present at a time. Microscopic and laboratory testing are usually recommended to determine the underlying cause of cat skin disease.

However, it’s still a good idea to take pictures of the problem, especially over time. These pictures can be useful in at least narrowing down the underlying cause of your cat’s skin condition.

Although achieving a diagnosis can often be time-consuming, it is ideal to figure out the cause of your cat’s symptoms so that the treatments can be targeted toward that cause.

Here are some of the most common cat skin conditions, signs to look for, and possible causes.

Hair Loss

One of the most common and most obvious signs of feline skin disease is hair loss. Pet parents are quick to notice when their cat is developing a bald patch or two.

Hair loss can be divided into two distinct symptoms: alopecia and barbering.

Alopecia

Alopecia refers to a thinning or total loss of hair at the level of the hair follicle. With alopecia, if you run your hand over the area of hair loss, it will usually feel smooth because the remaining hair is normal.

Alopecia can be the result of almost any cat skin disease—allergies, infections, parasite infestations, nutritional disorders, endocrine disease, and even certain cancers.

Barbering

Barbering is a self-induced thinning of the hair that occurs when a cat bites the hair shafts in two. With barbering, if you run your hand over the area of hair loss, it will feel prickly because of the sharp, bitten ends of the hair shafts.

Barbering is a trickier symptom to evaluate. When cats overgroom and barber their fur, it can be caused by itchiness, pain, or stress. If the cause of barbering is itchiness, the list of possible causes very similar to the causes of alopecia.

It is not uncommon, however, for owners to bring their cat to the vet for hair loss on the belly, expecting a diagnosis of skin disease, only to discover that the cat has a painful UTI. Pain in the abdominal cavity from pancreatitis, foreign body obstruction, tumors, or UTIs will often cause cats to groom and barber their undersides in a futile attempt to reduce the pain. Barbering along the back can be caused by spinal pain.

Barbering can also be psychogenic, meaning that neither pain nor itchiness are the cause of your cat’s overgrooming. Instead, stress can cause cats to exhibit all sorts of behavioral changes, including barbering their fur. What’s stressful to a cat can be much milder than what a person would consider stressful.

There’s at least one case report of a cat developing a stress-induced UTI after all the curtains in the house were changed. So if you bring your cat into the vet for barbered fur, it’s important to mention any potentially stressful changes at home, such as new pets or roommates, nearby construction, or any other changes to the typical sights and sounds your cat encounters at home.

Itchy Skin (Pruritus)

A symptom that is often related to hair loss is itchy skin. Itchiness, which veterinarians call pruritus, occurs when skin irritation creates inflammatory molecules that send signals to the brain, inducing the sensation of itch. Although many pet parents will change their cat’s food to minimize the itching, food allergies account for only one in five cases of itchy cats. That’s why it’s best to go to the vet for a correct diagnosis.

Letting your veterinarian know whether your cat’s skin condition seems to be itchy or not itchy can help narrow down the list of possible causes. Although the most common skin diseases in cats are generally itchy, non-itchy skin diseases include certain types of bacterial and fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorders, and endocrine diseases. As with fur barbering, it can be difficult to tell whether a cat’s licking and scratching is due to itchiness or pain.

Miliary Dermatitis

Miliary dermatitis is a common class of feline skin disease in which numerous small, grainy bumps appear on the surface of the cat’s skin. Miliary dermatitis, named for the way the texture of the skin resembles millet seeds, is considered a symptom, not a specific disease.

The most common cause of miliary dermatitis in cats is a hypersensitivity to flea bites, even in indoor-only cats. However, bacterial infections, ringworm infections, other parasitic infestations, autoimmune disease, and certain cancers are also possible causes.

Other allergies such as adverse food reactions or atopy commonly cause this symptom as well.

Scabs

Scabs occur after something—usually trauma—opens the skin enough to cause bleeding. When the blood clots and closes the injury, a scab is formed. Veterinarians actually have two words for scabs: crusts and excoriations.

An excoriation is self-induced, usually from scratching at an itchy skin condition, whereas a crust can be caused by any condition that ruptures the protective layer.

Examining the cells or the fluid beneath a crust microscopically is sometimes useful for achieving a diagnosis. Otherwise, leaving crusts alone is usually recommended.

Sores

Skin injuries are often precursors to scabs. While defects in your cat’s skin might be quite obvious, distinguishing the types—abrasions, ulcers, lacerations, punctures, abscesses—is a job for your veterinarian.

Since open wounds create an ideal environment for bacteria and other infectious microbes, preventing access to the wound is ideal. Your veterinarian may close the wound if possible, although only fresh wounds can be stitched closed.

Covering the wound is sometimes useful, but more often, these types of skin conditions are left open to heal. Veterinarians will often recommend application of a product containing antibiotics, antifungals, and anti-inflammatories. Always seek the advice of your veterinarian before initiating treatment.

Rashes

""Rash” is another extremely broad term that can encompass everything from hives to pustules to fresh bruising.

In general, people use the term rash to describe cat skin conditions that are flat and red and encompass a medium to large area of skin. Rashes are typically associated with inflammation, which can either be a primary problem (like allergies) or a secondary problem (like infections).

As with sores, it is important for your veterinarian to visually inspect any rashes on your cat. Tests may also be necessary before a diagnosis and treatment recommendation can be made.

Red Spots

As with rashes, red spots are common in cats and not indicate a specific disease, but instead can be caused by a wide variety of conditions.

As always, testing and visual inspection by your veterinarian will likely be required to achieve a diagnosis if your cat has red spots.

Dry, Flaky Skin (Scale)

Since the treatment for human dandruff is often as simple as a shampoo change, you might assume that a medicated shampoo that promises to “moisturize the skin” is all that’s needed to correct a cat’s dry, flaky skin, or what veterinarians call “scale.”

Medicated shampoos can often help alleviate this symptom, but you should have your cat checked out to determine the cause. Let your veterinarian know of any other symptoms, even those not related to the skin, that your cat has exhibited.

While cat dandruff can be caused by primary skin conditions, especially infections, it can also be secondary to other problems like nutritional imbalances, obesity, or conditions that can cause your cat to feel too sick to groom.

Oily Skin/Fur

Like dandruff, oily fur is a condition that encourages pet parents to transfer their knowledge of human hair care onto that of cats. When our hair looks greasy, most of us would take a shower to wash away the excess oil in our hair.

Cats, however, should be able to self-maintain the appearance of their fur coat. When the fur becomes greasy or oily in appearance, some step in the process of oil production and removal has been disrupted.

Oily fur is commonly seen in cats with miliary dermatitis, but it can also be the sole symptom. As with dandruff, oily fur can be caused primarily by skin disease, or can be attributable to other problems, especially obesity and thyroid disorders.

In many cases, medicated shampoos can help, but testing is needed to get the right diagnosis to determine the best course of treatment.

Infections

Although microbial infections can’t be seen with the naked eye, the associated symptoms can often point to cat skin infections:


	
	Miliary dermatitis (small, grainy bumps)
	
	
	Pustules (small, fluid-filled bumps)
	
	
	Epidermal collarettes (flaky skin encircling an area of reddened or darkened skin)
	
	
	Yellow, green, or chunky discharge coming from your cat’s skin
	
	
	Skin conditions with a strong smell
	


In many cases, however, feline skin that becomes infected does not look very abnormal at all. Itchiness, along with perhaps one or two of the symptoms mentioned above may be the only signs that a skin infection is present.

Your veterinarian may need to take a sample of the cells on the surface of the skin with a piece of clear tape to see whether bacteria or yeast are present in the skin cells. If no clear answer is identified, a biopsy may be needed to achieve a diagnosis.

In cats, skin biopsies are done with sedation or general anesthesia rather than using local anesthetic and allowing the cat to be awake while the sample is taken.

Treatment involves antibiotics and/or antifungal medications, given topically or by mouth, depending on the infection and the available products.

Parasites

Parasites love cats. A flea’s idea of heaven is drinking your cat’s blood while she naps in a sunbeam. For cats and for us, however, the idea of unwelcome guests occupying our skin doesn’t sound quite so lovely. Mites, ticks and other ectoparasites can live on or in your cat’s skin, where they create discomfort, spread secondary diseases, generate allergic responses, and potentially infect the humans in the family.

Sometimes, you might see one of these parasites with the naked eye. In most cases, though, these infestations are surprisingly subtle; you may only notice your cat scratching intermittently, or perhaps a rash or bumps along your cat’s back.

Because many cats live indoors only, pet parents can be quite skeptical that a parasitic infection is the cause of their cat’s symptoms. You can imagine their surprise when I run a flea comb through their cat’s fur and show them the flea dirt.

Parasite infestations remain one of the most common causes of skin disease in cats, so it’s always a good idea to take your cat to the vet as soon as you suspect skin disease. Your veterinarian will be able to perform a more thorough visual inspection, in addition to other tests like skin scrapes.

Treatments for parasitic infections are generally straightforward, but keeping your cat on monthly preventatives is the surest way to minimize the risk.

Bumps, Lumps, Skin Tags, and Tumors

There are many words for abnormal growths on the skin, and their definitions are often interchangeable.

The good news for cat owners is that, unlike dogs, cats’ bodies do not typically turn into skin tumor factories after a certain age. While a geriatric dog is certain to be littered with skin tags, soft fatty tumors, and warts, a cat’s skin is just not as prone to developing growths in the same fashion. Therefore, when you notice a growth on your cat’s skin, it is highly recommended to have the growth evaluated by your veterinarian.

Microscopic testing is almost always recommended. Collecting cells from the growth with a fine needle aspirate (FNA) and examining them under the microscope (cytology) is an important first step in deciding whether a growth is concerning or not.

Sometimes, the growth will need to be removed and sent out for a biopsy, where a pathologist will see exactly what the cause of the growth is. Then they can determine which treatments are needed, if any. In older female cats, especially, firm lumps under the skin of the belly should be examined immediately to check for mammary tumors.

Questions Your Vet Will Ask About Your Cat’s Skin Condition

Giving your veterinarian a thorough history of your pet’s health will be critical in getting your cat’s skin back to normal. Here are a few questions you should be prepared to answer when you go to your veterinarian:


	
	When did you first notice your cat’s skin condition?
	
	
	Is the problem getting worse over time, or better, or is it about the same?
	
	
	Does the skin issue keep coming back at a certain time each year?
	
	
	Have you tried any treatments at home? (not recommended, but your vet will want to know)
	
	
	Is your cat on a flea/tick preventative?
	
	
	Is your cat on any medications?
	
	
	What food is your cat eating?
	
	
	Is your cat indoor/outdoor, indoor-only, or outdoor-only?
	
	
	Has your cat ever been outdoors?
	
	
	Are there any sources of stress in your cat’s environment (even a minor change in the home)?
	
	
	Does your cat have any chronic medical conditions? (Even if you think it’s “in his file,” it never hurts to remind your veterinarian at the time of the appointment.)
	
	
	Are any other cats in your house affected?
	
	
	Are there any factors that seem to worsen your cat’s skin condition?
	
	
	Has your cat traveled with you to other parts of the country or the world?
	


How to Prevent Cat Skin Conditions

They say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Here are some ways you can help support your cat’s skin health.

Feed Them a High-Quality Cat Food

The first step in keeping your cat’s skin healthy is to ask your veterinarian to recommend a high-quality diet. Poor-quality diets often result in poor-quality skin and a dull hair coat.

Keep Your Cat at a Healthy Weight

Keeping your cat at an appropriate “body condition score,” meaning not underweight or overweight, will allow them to continue grooming for the duration of their life.

Use Flea and Tick Control

Flea and tick preventatives are very important, even in indoor cats.

I treat itchy New York City apartment cats on a near-daily basis. When I mention parasites as a contributing cause of itch, nearly all owners are in disbelief. I hear things like, “How can my cat get fleas if he hasn’t left the apartment in 3 years?” or “I haven’t seen any mites,” and yet the parasites are there, far more often than you’d think.

Manage Your Cat’s Stress Levels

Minimizing stress for your cat can minimize the risk of psychogenic skin issues like overgrooming. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations for stress-relieving products such as cat pheromone diffusers.

Assist With Grooming When Needed

Although “assisted grooming” can be an appropriate treatment in cats that have difficulty doing the job themselves, especially cats that are older or overweight, you should not bathe or groom your cat too much, as this can cause its own set of problems. You can help your cat groom by using tools such as a damp rag and a rubber grooming brush.

541,Colonic Ulcer in Cats,"Histiocytic Ulcerative Colitis in Cats

Histiocytes are large white blood cells that reside in the normal connective tissue, where they ingest infectious microorganisms and foreign particles. They are an essential component of the immune system. Histiocytic ulcerative colitis is an uncommon disease characterized by ulcers in the lining of the colon, and inflammation with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive histiocytes. The origin and pathogenic mechanism for this disorder is unknown; however, an infectious cause is assumed. Histiocytic ulcerative colitis may also have a possible genetic basis, but the cause is unknown. This is a rare condition in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Bloody, mucoid diarrhea with increasing frequency of defecation
    Tenesmus (a feeling that one needs to defecate).
    Weight loss and debilitation may develop later in the disease process


Causes

There is no known cause or predisposing factors.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need to rule out other causes for the colitis. there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Causes that will be confirmed or ruled out in this process include nonhistiocytic IBD, infectious colitis, parasitic colitis, and allergic colitis.

Other diagnoses that may become apparent include cecal inversion, where the first portion of the large bowel is turned in on itself; ileocolic intussusception, where one part of the bowel passes into the next one; neoplasia, such as lymphoma or adenocarcinoma - a type of cancer that originates in a gland; a foreign body; rectocolonic polyps; and irritable bowel syndrome. Differentiation can be made by examination of fecal flotations, direct smears, bacterial culture for pathogens, abdominal imaging, and colonoscopy with biopsy.

A colonoscopy of the intestines may reveal patchy red foci (pinpoint ulcerations), overt ulceration, thick mucosal folds, areas of granulation tissue, or narrowing of the intestine. Multiple biopsy specimens will need to be taken to obtain a diagnosis.

  

Treatment

Your cat's outpatient medical management will include changing its diet to include moderately fermentable fiber supplementation. Your veterinarian will advise you of the possibility of progressive disease and recurrence and may prescribe antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory drugs.

Living and Management

Clinical signs and body weight should be monitored every week to two weeks initially. Depending on the outcome, your cat may need ongoing antibiotic therapy."," and Types

542,Collection of Fluid in the Lungs (Not Due to Heart Disease) in Cats,"Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema in Cats



Noncardiogenic edema is caused by an increased permeability (or the ability to pass through, as by osmosis) of the blood vessels of the lungs. This increased permeability results in the leakage of fluid into the lung, causing edema, or swelling. This increased permeability results in the leakage of fluid into the lung, causing edema, or swelling. When this becomes severe, the edema may be accompanied by an inflammatory response and an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung.



There are several factors which can cause changes in the permeability of the lung’s blood vessels. Cats that have edema as a result of brain disorder, electric cord bite, or upper airway obstruction might experience a systemic release of catecholamines (neurotransmitters and hormones). This release would lead to a causative effect, with systemic constriction of blood vessels shunting blood into the lungs and overloading the blood vessels of the lung, damaging them, and leading to inflammation and swelling of the lungs.



Manifestation of a generalized inflammatory response in the lungs develops in patients with a bacterial infection of the blood, or with pancreatitis, and will often worsen over the 24 hours following the initial episode. The most seriously affected patients may progress from apparently normal health to a fatal condition only hours after the incident.



Symptoms and Types




	Difficulty breathing
	Increased breathing rate
	Standing in unusual positions to breathe better
	Pale, or bluish gums
	Spitting up pink, frothy saliva, or bubbles of saliva
	Increased rate of heart beat




Causes




	Upper airway obstruction
	
		Paralysis of the larynx
		Mass in the lung
		Abscess of the lung
	
	
	Acute neurologic disease (brain disorders)
	
		Head trauma
		Prolonged seizures
	
	
	Systemic inflammatory response syndrome
	
		Bacterial infection in the blood (bacteremia)
		Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
	
	
	Electric cord bite injury
	Smoke inhalation
	Aspiration pneumonia (sucking fluid back into the lungs)
	Severe allergic reaction




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms.





He or she will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Arterial blood gas measurement, and pulse oximetry will also be performed, along with coagulation testing (to determine whether the blood is clotting normally). Radiograph images of the thoracic (chest) cavity are also essential for making a definitive diagnosis. An echocardiogram may also be performed to rule out, or confirm, pulmonary (lung) edema caused by heart disease.





Treatment



If your cat is experiencing severe respiratory dysfunction it will be hospitalized until its breathing has stabilized. If your cat is affected with a moderate to severe form of the disease it will be given oxygen therapy and cage rest in a quiet environment to minimize stress, since anything that can bring on anxiety for the cat will cause the production of stress hormones. If your cat is having too much of a problem breathing on its own it may be put on a mechanical respirator until it is able to breath normally again.

 

Living and Management



Often, cats with noncardiogenic edema will worsen before improving. Cats that have progressed to a severely form of pulmonary edema tend to have a poor prognosis. However, mild to moderately ill patients stand a good chance of full recovery, and the long-term prognosis is excellent for recovered patients.



One of the ways you can prevent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in your cat includes preventing it from chewing on electrical wires. Another way is to get immediate veterinary treatment for your cat at the first sign of seizures."," and Types

543,Collapse of the Wind Pipe in Cats,"Tracheal Collapse in Cats

Tracheal collapse may affect the part of the trachea that is located in the neck (cervical trachea), or it may affect the lower part of the trachea, located in the chest (intrathoracic trachea). The trachea is the large tube that carries air from the nose and throat to the small airways (bronchi) that go to the lungs, and collapse of the trachea describes a condition in which the tracheal cavity (lumen) has narrowed during breathing, making the process of breathing difficult to accomplish.

Though tracheal collapse is rare in cats, it can affect cats of any age or gender.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of tracheal abnormalities seem to be aggravated by heat, excitement, exercise or obesity. The following symptoms are commonly observed in affected animals:


    Dry honking cough
    Difficult breathing
    Retching, attempting to vomit
    Abnormally rapid breathing
    Abnormal breathing sounds
    Unable to perform routine exercises
    Bluish colored membranes
    Spontaneous loss of consciousness


Causes


    Congenital - existing at birth

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your cat. The routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count may show an abnormally high number of white blood cells (WBCs), indicative of infection.

Diagnostic imaging is an essential part of the diagnostic process, since the lungs and trachea will need to be examined as completely as possible. Chest X-ray remains a valuable tool, and may reveal a collapsed trachea as well as to help your veterinarian find the location of collapse. In some cases, enlargement of the right side of the heart may also be found. 

Fluoroscopy, another advanced diagnostic technique, but one which can provide real time, active images of the internal body, may also be used for your cat. Fluoroscopy works by using an X-ray device placed in front of a fluorescent screen, with the patient on the other side of the screen, so that the physician can see the internal structure in motion, allowing for a more refined image and a more accurate assessment and diagnosis.

Your veterinarian may also take a tissue sample from the inside of the trachea for laboratory testing. This sample will be used to grow the bacteria in the tissue in order to determine if there is any harmful bacteria present in the tracheal tube, and conduct culture testing to see the types of cells that are present in the sample.



In order to grade the severity of the collapse, another technique called bronchoscopy can also be used. In this procedure, the bronchoscope, a tubular instrument with a camera attached, is threaded into the trachea and the images are retrieved and relayed onto video equipment where they can be reviewed and assessed in the process of making the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is a more invasive method than the standard X-rays, but it can give a much more detailed view of the various abnormalities present in the tracheal tube, including foreign bodies, bleeding, inflammation, or tumors inside the airways. Bronchoscopy can also allow for estimating the degree of narrowing in the trachea, which may range from a grade-1 to grade-6 degree, measured on the basis of increasing severity. The bronchoscope can even be used to collect tissue and fluid samples from deeper within the tracheal canal for laboratory testing.

Treatment

Hospitalization will be required if your dog is having severe symptoms  and is not able to breathe properly. To compensate for respiratory  problems oxygen therapy is administered. It is also typical to heavily  sedate cats with a collapsed trachea. This is so that they are not suffering, but also so that they are not fighting against the physical restrictions caused by the disease and against the treatments that are being used. Activity needs to be kept as minimal as possible until the cat has stabilized.

There are several drugs that can be used in the treatment of tracheal collapse. Cough suppressant medication can be used to minimize the stress related to the continuous coughing that is commonly associated with tracheal collapse, and your veterinarian will also give medication to dilate the small airways to facilitate normal breathing.  Other drugs for reducing inflammation in the trachea will also be started to reduce the symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be required, especially if obstruction is a problem. However, complications are common in these patients after surgery.

Living and Management
 
Though complete rest is recommended for these patients during recovery, gently exercise and adherence to a healthy diet is highly advised for reducing weight on a long-term basis. Weight reduction plays an important role in relieving symptoms, and most cats respond well to a well planned weight reduction program. Talk to your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist about a weight-loss program that is best suited to your cat's weight, age, health condition and breed.

Overexcitement is discouraged in these animals, as it may precipitate a crisis for their already compromised lung function. Gentle exercise is best, so you will need keep your cat indoors as much as possible, but still provide enough space for the cat to move freely so that it is getting a sufficient amount of physical exercise. The prognosis for remission from the disease is good if proper treatment and weight loss can be achieved."," and Types

Symptoms of tracheal abnormalities seem to be aggravated by heat, excitement, exercise or obesity. The following symptoms are commonly observed in affected animals:


    Dry honking cough
    Difficult breathing
    Retching, attempting to vomit
    Abnormally rapid breathing
    Abnormal breathing sounds
    Unable to perform routine exercises
    Bluish colored membranes
    Spontaneous loss of consciousness

544,Coccidioidomycosis in Cats,"What Is Coccidioidomycosis in Cats?
Coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever, is a disease caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis. Cats get infected with this disease after inhaling the spores from the air. It is transmitted to many species of animals, including cats and people, but dogs seem to be the most severely affected.

Since this infection enters the body by inhalation, it goes directly to the cat’s lungs, causing a local infection in the respiratory system. From the lungs, it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body, which is called a disseminated infection. Disseminated infections are much more serious, but either form of coccidioidomycosis can be fatal in cats. Approximately 50% of infected cats appear to have disseminated disease.

This fungus is found in the soil predominantly in the U.S. Southwest, in a very dry region known as the Lower Sonoran life zone. It has also been reported in Northern Mexico, Central America, and South America in regions with the same arid and semi-arid climates. Recently it has been reported as far north as Washington State.

Symptoms of Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
Clinical signs tend to develop within a few weeks after spores are inhaled into the lungs. If the fungal spores escape the lungs and travel throughout the body, it can take several months after the initial cough for other signs to develop. Sometimes the initial cough can be mild, and infection can go undetected until the animal is very ill.

Other areas of the body commonly affected in cats with disseminated coccidioidomycosis are the skin, muscles, bones, brain, spinal cord, and eyes. It’s very important to have your cat examined by their veterinarian at the first sign of any illness or abnormality, even if it does not seem significant at the time. A cough in cats should always be taken seriously, as it can be an indication of a medical emergency.

Causes of Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
As noted, coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, occurs after cats inhale fungal spores. This illness can occur in a cat that has inhaled fewer than 10 microscopic fungal spores. Coccidioidomycosis is a dimorphic fungus, which means it can exist both as yeast (single cell) and mold (multicellular). This fungal organism grows deep in the soil and can survive at high temperatures and low moisture in desert regions.

During the rainy season, this fungus will return to the surface of the soil and produce spores, which are spread rapidly by wind. Cats are most often infected after the soil has been disturbed, such as after rainfall, a dust storm, an earthquake, a crop harvest, or during construction.

Most cats infected with valley fever are young, as these are the cats that tend to be most active outdoors. Cats that dig in the dirt or that live in areas where they are in or around dust storms may also be at greater risk for exposure. For cats living in areas where Valley Fever has been reported, keeping them indoors, especially during the rainy season or when major weather events occur, is highly recommended. Rapid spread of this fungal disease may occur when rainy periods are followed by drought, resulting in dust storms.

In general, valley fever is not contagious among cats, between cats and dogs, or between cats and people. However, in one case from 2008 in which a veterinary technician was bitten by a cat, the wound was diagnosed as coccidioidomycosis.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
An important aspect of diagnosing a valley fever infection is to know if your cat frequents the type of place that harbors the fungal organism, so providing your veterinarian with a detailed history of your pet’s activities is critical. A complete physical examination will also be performed, and full bloodwork (chemistry panel, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel) including urine testing is usually ordered to assess body function and to rule out other conditions that might cause similar signs.

Diagnosis of valley fever can be very difficult in cats and is usually made through visualization of fungal organisms under the microscope. However, coccidioidomycosis should be considered in cats with consistent clinical signs within the endemic region — a particular area where a disease outbreak is known to have occurred.

A special blood test called a titer is also important in making the diagnosis for valley fever. If your cat has lesions on the skin or other organs of the body, a biopsy may be needed to collect cells or remove a piece of abnormal tissue to test for the coccidioidomycosis-causing organism. These lesions can be found during physical examination as skin abscesses, on radiographs as lung nodules, or even using advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI for advanced lung disease or when other body systems are affected.

In cats that are coughing with or without lung disease evident on the initial chest x-rays, an airway wash (tracheal wash or tracheal lavage) is typically ordered. This procedure requires your cat to be heavily sedated so that lung fluid samples can be collected for analysis. It is possible that your vet can see the fungal spores in this analysis, which would confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment of Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
Most cats with coccidioidomycosis are treated at home rather than in the hospital. Treatment for cats with valley fever involves an extended course of oral antifungal medication, usually fluconazole. Hospitalization is highly dependent on how severely affected your cat is. Cats that are having breathing issues or are not eating are more likely to be hospitalized. Other supportive care may be necessary to help with symptoms, including oxygen therapy for those having trouble breathing, IV fluids, anti-inflammatories, appetite stimulants, or liver protectants.

Antifungal medications often have side effects on the liver and gastrointestinal system. For this reason, it is important that your vet monitor your cat’s liver enzymes and other body functions with bloodwork and urine testing done routinely during and after treatment.

Aggressive antifungal therapy is usually required from several months to over a year. The decision to stop antifungal medication will be determined after your cat’s clinical signs have resolved and after two blood tests are negative for active infection.

Recovery and Management of Coccidioidomycosis in Cats
If illness is limited to the lungs and treated with appropriate medication, the prognosis is good and the recovery rate approaches 90%. Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for cats with disseminated coccidioidomycosis is guarded, as relapse of the disease is common following initial treatment.

Many cats will improve with oral antifungal medication. However, relapses are common, especially if therapy is not completed as prescribed or is shortened unnecessarily. Recovery without treatment is not typical, but it is possible for an animal to develop an immunity to the infection and recover from it. Asymptomatic infections may occur, in which cats are exposed but develop immunity without experiencing the signs of the full-blown disease.

545,Coccidia in Cats,"What Is Coccidia in Cats?
Coccidia are single-celled (protozoan) parasites that nearly all cats are exposed to in their lifetime. The parasite travels into the intestinal lining cells of the cat, where it matures over about two weeks into oocysts, rupturing the cells and causing intestinal damage. These oocysts then pass through the intestines into the stool to finish their life cycle, become infective (sporulate), and spread into the environment. It takes no more than 16 hours for a passed oocyst to sporulate into an infective state. Once in that state, they can survive for up to year in temperate environments.  

There are many species of coccidia that infect many different animals, but almost all these parasites are host-specific, meaning a cat cannot transmit an infection to a dog or human, they can only transmit it to other cats.

Symptoms of Coccidia in Cats
An infection with coccidia does not always mean an illness is present. Many cats will eliminate the parasite on their own while others may shed oocysts in their stool without ever showing symptoms (asymptomatic). When illness (coccidiosis) does occur, it is often in young kittens or older cats with poor immune systems. 

As the life cycle of these parasites occurs in the intestines, signs of illness are related to the digestive system. Diarrhea is most common and may be associated with weight loss. Cats can become dehydrated (especially young kittens), and reluctant to engage in normal, playful behaviors. Only in rare cases will there be vomiting and loss of appetite. These symptoms may be aggravated by stressful environmental changes like adoption, weaning, or living in an animal shelter.

Causes of Coccidia in Cats
Most cats, particularly those who spend time outdoors, pick up this parasite from their environment, grooming it off their fur and feet.

Mice, rats, and other common prey species are known as transport hosts because they can carry certain life stages of coccidia, which then infect the cats who hunt them. Cats who share a litterbox with an infected cat risk picking up the parasite themselves, even if they do not hunt or go outside.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Coccidia in Cats
A veterinarian will take into consideration the cat’s history, symptoms, and use a microscope to determine if oocysts are present.  

Coccidia is diagnosed through a stool sample. In this testing, fecal matter is mixed with a special solution that allows the oocysts to float to the surface, where they can be collected on a slide and examined under a microscope. Each species of coccidia has a unique oocyst appearance that can be identified.  

Treatment of Coccidia in Cats
Coccidia is usually eliminated in cats with an oral antimicrobial medication. Sulfadimethoxine (Albon®) is the most commonly used product, though there are other medications that may be recommended. 

Depending on the severity of the cat’s illness, antimicrobial treatment is often combined with medications to help alleviate symptoms, such as probiotics, low residue diets, anti-nausea medications, and fluid therapy.

Recovery and Prevention of Coccidia in Cats
Cats that are properly treated and supported typically make a full recovery from coccidiosis.  

Daily removal of feces from the litterbox, routine cleaning of the environment, and treating all cats in contact with the infected cat are recommended to prevent the spread of disease.

Cats with outdoor access and cats who like to hunt should have fecal flotation tests completed annually to look for asymptomatic infections.
Coccidia in Cats FAQsCan cats get rid of coccidia on their own?Asymptomatic cats frequently eliminate coccidia infections on their own.

Cats with signs of illness may recover without intervention, but they will likely be in significant discomfort. It is not recommended that infected cats recover without medication as it will prolong illness and they are likely to spread the infection to other cats.
What happens if coccidia goes untreated?Untreated clinical coccidiosis can lead to dehydration, weight loss, lack of appetite, and even death.
How long can coccidia live in carpet?Certain life stages of coccidia can live for months in the environment, including carpeting.
How do you get rid of coccidia in your home?It is important to clean litterboxes daily to prevent maturation of coccidia oocysts. Mature or sporulated oocysts are more resistant to most common disinfectants. Treating infected animals and keeping the environment clean are the most important steps.
Is coccidia contagious to other pets?Coccidia is host-specific, meaning the specific species that infects cats can only infect cats. There is no risk to other kinds of household pets.
Is coccidia contagious to humans?Humans are not susceptible to infection from feline coccidiosis.
Are there home remedies for coccidia in cats?Coccidiosis should only be treated under the supervision of a veterinarian with FDA-approved medications.

546,Clotting Disorders of the Platelets in Cats,"Thrombocytopathies in Cats
 
Thrombocytopathic animals are those which typically have normal platelet counts on examination, but have spontaneous or excessive bleeding due to a failure of the platelets to bind to each other, or clot normally. Thrombocytopathies are defined as disorders of the blood platelet and abnormal functioning of the platelets. Bleeding from the mucous membranes – nose, mouth ears, anus – is the most common sign. Thrombocytopathies may first become apparent in young animals when excessive bleeding occurs with the loss of baby teeth.
 
Thrombocytopathies can be acquired or hereditary; they affect the main functions of platelets: activation, adhesion and aggregation. That is, they lack the ability to group together and adhere to each other, an important function for sealing wounds. This can result in severe bleeding from even the smallest wound. Animals having a low blood platelet count with concurrent thrombocytopathia will bleed more excessively than expected for the existent platelet count. Any breed of cat can be affected by acquired thrombocytopathies.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Spontaneous bleeding
    Nosebleeds (epistaxis)
    Bleeding is often from mucosal surfaces (nose, mouth, gums, etc.)
    Prolonged bleeding in some animals during diagnostic or surgical procedures

Hereditary thrombocytopathy

    von Willebrand disease
    Aggregation (platelet clumping) defect
    Chediak-Higashi syndrome 

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat after taking a full medical and background history, and a description of the onset of symptoms from you. Your veterinarian will order a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The complete blood count may show a condition of anemia if bleeding has been severe.  Platelet counts are often normal in cats with inherited thrombocytopathies.
 
A von Willebrand disease assay can be performed if your cat is suspected of having this disease. Platelet function testing can also be done in select laboratories. Coagulation tests (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) should be ordered to eliminate coagulopathy (a disease affecting the blood's ability to clot) as a cause of the excessive bleeding. 
 
Mucosal bleeding time can be measured by making a small incision on the inside of the cheek (buccal) in the mouth. The amount of blood and length of time it takes for the incision to be sealed with a clot of blood will either confirm or rule out a clotting disorder.
 
Treatment
 
Patients may be given a platelet transfusion to increase the number of platelets. This is also appropriate treatment if the underlying cause is von Willebrand disease. Patients should be transfused with platelets as a preventative measure or if it is noted that they are bleeding out. If your cat is anemic, whole blood or packed red cells should be transfused.
 
Patients with prolonged buccal mucosal times should be given special preparation before any surgery to prevent excessive bleeding during procedures. In addition, veterinarians should minimize injections to the patient and apply extended pressure after intravenous injections, intravenous catheterization, and invasive procedures.
 
Animals with acquired thrombocytopathies should have the underlying cause of the disease treated. This means withdrawing them from certain medicines if necessary.
 
Living and Management
 
Thrombocyopathic pets may bleed at home, but it is very rare that they will bleed to death. Restrict your cat's activity during a bleeding episode to minimize the amount lost, and try to avoid feeding  hard foods to your cat, as some foods may cause friction to the gum tissue, resulting in bleeding. If a hereditary disorder is found to be underlying the clotting disorder, it is advisable to have your cat fixed so that it cannot breed."," and Types

547,Clotting Deficiency (Liver Related) in Cats,"Coagulopathy of Liver Disease in Cats

The liver is vital for the synthesis of anticoagulant, coagulation, and fibrinolytic proteins. In fact, only five blood clotting factors are not produced there. Therefore, liver diseases that cause clotting issues in cats can be very serious and sometimes life-threatening.

Symptoms and Types


    Black 	feces due to digested blood (melena)
    Bright 	red blood in the feces (hematochezia)
    Vomiting 	or spitting up blood (hematemesis)
    Prolonged 	bleeding after drawing blood, urine, or from recent surgical wounds
    Spontaneous 	bruising (rare)


Causes

The causes of coagulopathy of liver disease are abundant, including:


    Severe 	liver failure
    Acute 	viral liver disease
    Cirrhosis 	(hardening and shrinking of the liver with loss of functional 	tissue)
    Extrahepatic 	bile duct obstruction (EHBDO)
    Vitamin 	K deficiency linked to severe intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis 	(blockage of the bile ducts) or steatorrhea (fat in the feces due to 	trouble digesting fat since enzymes the liver makes are lacking).
    Portosystemic 	Vascular Anomaly (PSVA), causing insufficient blood flow to the 	liver


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte panel.

Hemostatic tests like prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin clotting time (TCT), and Proteins invoked by Vitamin K Absence (PIVKA) are useful for measuring the severity of the cat’s inability to clot normally.  Tests can also be performed to detect low coagulation/anticoagulant factor (antithrombin (AT) and protein (C) activity. X-rays, meanwhile, are used to identify liver abnormalities, fluid in the abdomen, abnormal intestinal motility and thickening in affected areas.
 
  

Treatment

In many cases, invasive procedures are unnecessary unless there is severe hemorrhaging. Fresh whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or platelet-rich plasma are viable options to treat hemostatic disorders.

However, If the cat has fluid buildup in the abdomen, a sample should be taken to determine if it is due to a hemorrhage or ascites. This must be done with extreme care to avoid exacerbating the problem.

Living and Management

A vitamin-rich, well-balanced diet is vital for a quick recovery. Deworming your pet of parasites can also help prevent future intestinal bleeding."," and Types

548,Clotting Deficiency (Inherited)) in Cats,"Coagulation Factor Deficiency in Cats

Coagulation takes place when blood transforms from a free flowing liquid into a thickened gel like state. In this state the gelled blood is called a clot, and it is through clotting that a wound begins to seal. This process is critically important for healing to take place. When your pet is injured and continues to bleed uncontrollably, this may be symptomatic of a defect in one or more of the processes that bring about coagulation. A complex series of enzyme reactions are involved in turning blood from a fluid to a gel, and a failure in one of these processes can cause prolonged hemorrhaging after an injury, and will result ultimately in blood loss anemia. The failure of blood to coagulate can also result in internal hemorrhaging. Knowing the symptoms to watch for is crucial. 
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms of coagulation factor deficiency can include prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, an obvious external symptom. Some of the less obvious symptoms that can be indicative of a coagulation deficiency are related to blood loss anemia and internal bleeding. With blood loss anemia, symptoms can present as weakness, lethargy, short breath, irregular heart beat, confusion, and a condition known medically as pica -- a compulsive eating behavior that is often intended to balance a lack of minerals or vitamins in the blood; in this case, iron deficiency from loss of blood. The animal will crave and eat non-food items, such as stones, dirt, and feces, amongst other things.
 
Internal bleeding may present as bloody vomit or stools, bleeding from the rectum or vagina, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart rhythm, swollen or hard abdomen, and excessive thirst.
 
Causes
 
Several factors can determine the probability that your pet is suffering from coagulation factor deficiency. An underlying disorder, such as vitamin K deficiency, can affect the functioning of the liver, one of the primary sites for synthesizing the enzymes necessary for coagulation. Other problems with the liver can also affect the process of enzyme synthesization. The underlying cause for coagulation deficiency can also be predisposed by hereditary traits. An example of this is Hemophilia. Both the A and B forms of hemophilia are x-linked recessive traits, where males bleed excessively and the females carry the trait and pass it on. Hemophilia is characterized by an abnormally low amount of the protein needed to bind blood platelets into a clot. This protein process is one of the coagulation factors that the body utilizes for clotting external and internal wounds. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, and is not always inherited. It can also develop when the body forms antibodies that block the coagulation factor processes. Severe deficiency of coagulating factors will usually become apparent by four to six months of age. Milder deficiency may show up after an injury or after surgery.
 
In addition, external environmental circumstances may play a role in the incidence of coagulation factor deficiency. Ingestion of rat poison, or a snake bite, can affect the body's ability to process enzymes and proteins normally. Medically prescribed medications can affect the blood's ability to clot as well. Long term use of antibiotics can cause complications, and the use of prescription Heparin as an anti-coagulant (used for breaking up blood clots in the veins) can result in an accidental overdose.
 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian may first want to rule out external factors, such as access to rodent poison, or recent contact with a snake or a lizard. A complete blood test will be ordered, and an assay of the blood's ability to coagulate will be used to determine the source of the disorder. If your pet shows signs of increased red blood cells (RBC), an indication of regenerative anemia, it will signal the possibility of internal blood loss.

If blood loss is severe, your pet will be hospitalized and will receive blood and plasma transfusions. In fact, repeated transfusions may be necessary to control or prevent further hemorrhaging. Your veterinarian will probably also prescribe vitamin K, especially if your pet has ingested rodent poison or is experiencing other conditions that deplete this vitamin.
 
Living and Management
 
Your doctor will continue to test your cat's blood on an ongoing basis to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation, if it has been prescribed. It should begin to normalize 24 to 48 hours after the beginning of therapy. The only way to test whether a hereditary deficiency has been treated successfully is by factor analysis; whether the hematomas (collections of clotted blood) have been resolved, and most importantly, whether the bleeding has stopped. Transfusion sometimes causes immune reactions when antibodies resist the new blood. If transfusion is a decided treatment, your pet will need to be monitored for symptoms of rejection.
 
There is no particular breed that is more susceptible than another, so there is nothing that can be done to prevent it unless it is known to be in the genetic makeup of your cat's family line. If it is determined that a hereditary factor is responsible for the coagulation factor deficiency, it is best not to breed this animal."," and Types
 
Symptoms of coagulation factor deficiency can include prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, an obvious external symptom. Some of the less obvious symptoms that can be indicative of a coagulation deficiency are related to blood loss anemia and internal bleeding. With blood loss anemia, symptoms can present as weakness, lethargy, short breath, irregular heart beat, confusion, and a condition known medically as pica -- a compulsive eating behavior that is often intended to balance a lack of minerals or vitamins in the blood; in this case, iron deficiency from loss of blood. The animal will crave and eat non-food items, such as stones, dirt, and feces, amongst other things.
 
Internal bleeding may present as bloody vomit or stools, bleeding from the rectum or vagina, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart rhythm, swollen or hard abdomen, and excessive thirst.

549,Cleft Palate in Cats,"Feline Cleft Palate 



Cleft palate is an abnormal opening in the roof of the mouth. It is caused by failure of the two sides of the palate (roof of the mouth) to come together and fuse during embryonic development. A cleft palate results in an opening between the nasal passages and the mouth.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms expected with a cleft palate include:




	Runny nose
	Coughing
	Aspiration pneumonia (pneumonia caused by milk and food contents entering the cleft and infecting the lungs)
	Respiratory difficulty (caused by aspiration pneumonia)
	Difficulty sucking and nursing (in the kitten)
	Slow growth
	Weight loss
	Lack of appetite




Causes



Cleft palate is most often a congenital disorder, likely inherited, and there is a breed predilection in Norwegian forest cats, ocicats, Persians, ragdolls, savannahs, and Siamese.



Cleft palates can also be caused by exposure of pregnant female cats to teratogenic chemicals (chemicals that interfere with normal embryo development). These chemicals include griseofulvicin and excessive vitamin A and vitamin D. In these cases, the kittens may be born with cleft palates.



Diagnosis



Diagnosis is made by a visual examination of the cleft palate.







Treatment



Treatment is surgical repair of the defect. Surgical correction is usually postponed until 3-4 months of age, if possible. More than one surgery is often necessary for complete closure of the opening in the palate.



Living and Management



Kittens with cleft palates should be fed with a long nipple, which brings food into the oro-pharynx (the part of the mouth behind the palate but in front of the voice box), or with a feeding tube inserted into the stomach until the defect can be surgically repaired."," and Types



Symptoms expected with a cleft palate include:




	Runny nose

550,Claw and Nail Disorders in Cats,"Nail and Nailbed Disorders in Cats

 

Nail and nail bed disorders may refer to any abnormality or disease that affects the claws or the surrounding area. The disorders are generally known as dystrophies. One type of nail disorder, paronychia, is an infection that causes inflammation of the tissue around the nail or claw. Onychomycosis, or fungal infection, can also occur in and around the nail bed.

 

Cats may exhibit extremely brittle nails (onychorrhexis), or have nails that separate, peel, and slough excessively (onychomadesis). Most nail or nail bed disorders have an excellent treatment prognosis and can be remedied in a relatively short amount of time.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Common signs of nail or nail bed disorders can include:

 


	Licking at the paws
	Lameness, difficulty walking
	Pain in the feet
	Swelling or redness of the tissues surrounding the nails
	Nail plate deformity (the part of the nail that overlays the nail bed)
	Abnormal nail color


 

Causes

 

Some of the most common causes for nail or nail bed disorders can include:

 


	Infection
	Bacteria or fungus
	Tumor or cancer
	Trauma
	Immune system (immune-mediated) diseases
	Excessive levels of growth hormone
	Disorders present at birth (congenital)
	Cutting the nails too close to the nail bed (making them susceptible to infection)
	Neoplasia


 

Diagnosis

 

In the event that your cat is suffering from a trauma to the nail bed, you will want to check to see if it has affected only a single nail. If multiple nails are being affected, a serious underlying medical condition is the more likely cause for the disorder. A skin scraping may be taken to determine what type of a skin condition your cat is experiencing, and a bacterial or fungal culture may also be taken for further analysis.

 

 

 



Treatment

 

Treatment will be dependent upon the particular underlying medical condition that is causing the nail or nail bed condition. If the nail area is inflamed, surgical removal of the nail plate (the hard portion) may be necessary to encourage drainage of the underlying tissue. Antimicrobial soaks can also be effective for reducing inflammation and encouraging the healing process. If the condition is related to a bacteria or a fungus, topical treatments and/or ointments are often administered to the affected area.

 

Living and Management

 

In most cases, application of the topical treatment or ointment will clear up any nail issues. While there are typically not many serious complications that can arise from these disorders, it is important to observe your cat's recovery and to act promptly if healing does not progress in a positive direction.

 

Prevention

 

One way to protect your vat from suffering a nail injury or disorder is to avoid cutting too close to the nail bed (the quick) when trimming the nails. Nicks to the skin can occur, opening your cat to infection as it goes about its normal routine (i.e., using the litter box, exploring). It is essential to look closely at your cat's nails before cutting them, so that you can determine exactly where the quick of the nail is – that is, the part of the nail bed that overlays the tissue and blood vessels. You do not want cut into that part of the nail; only the free edge that extends past the nail bed should be trimmed. Researching the proper way to cut your cat's nails, paying close attention, and promptly cleansing the area when an inadvertent injury does occur will go a long way toward protecting your cat from a painful nail disorder or trauma."," and Types

 

Common signs of nail or nail bed disorders can include:

 


	Licking at the paws

551,Cirrhosis and Fibrosis of the Liver in Cats,"Put simply, cirrhosis of the liver is the generalized (diffuse) formation of scar tissue. It is associated with regenerative nodules, or masses, and deranged liver architecture. Fibrosis of the liver, on the other hand, involves the formation of scar tissue that replaces normal liver tissue. This condition can be inherited or acquired.

Symptoms and Types


    Seizures
    Blindness

    Lack 	of energy
    Loss 	of appetite (anorexia)

    Cats:
    
        Fluid 		build-up in the abdomen (ascites) uncommon
        Drooling 		(known as ptyalism)
    
    
    Possible 	bleeding tendencies (uncommon)
    Skin 	lesions with superficial, ulcerative inflammation (superficial 	necrolytic dermatitis)


Causes


    Long-term 	(chronic) liver injury
    Long-term 	(chronic) inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
    Drug- 	or toxin-induced liver injury - copper-storage liver disease 	(copper-storage hepatopathy); medications to control seizures (known 	as anticonvulsants); azole medications to treat fungal infections; 	medication to treat intestinal parasites (oxibendazole); antibiotic 	(trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 	drugs (NSAIDs); long-term (chronic) food-borne toxin (aflatoxins)
    Infectious 	disease
    Long-term 	(chronic) inflammation of the bile ducts and liver (known as 	“cholangiohepatitis”) in cats
    Long-term 	(chronic) blockage of the extrahepatic or common bile duct 	(extrahepatic bile duct obstruction) - lasting more than six weeks


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out other causes of disease are also standard examination procedures.

A fine needle aspirate should be taken from the liver for a sample to be sent for cytologic analysis. A liver biopsy taken via laparoscope may also be necessary to form a definitive diagnosis.



Treatment

Patients with minimal signs can be treated on an outpatient basis as long as they are still eating normally. Patients with more severe signs should be hospitalized, given fluid therapy if necessary and have a feeding tube inserted if they are showing symptoms of  anorexia. Electrolytes may be supplemented while administering fluids, and some patients respond well to B-complex vitamins.

If there is abdominal fluid build-up, the fluid will need to be tapped and removed, and sodium restricted in the diet until the cause of the build-up has been resolved.

Cats displaying signs of hepatic encephalopathy (ammonia buildup in the blood causing neurologic signs) will need to have food withheld, as should cats that are vomiting and/or suffering from inflammation of the pancreas. Such patients should have individualized protein portions suited to their level of hepatic dysfunction.  Albumin levels should be maintained.

If surgery is being considered, a clotting profile will need to be performed. This is due to a concern that patients with longer clotting times will have an increased chance of bleeding, even during minor surgeries.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule regular check-ups with you for your cat.  At these visits, blood work will be done, including monitoring of total serum bile acids. Your veterinarian will also observe your cat’s overall body condition and observe to see if fluid is building up in the abdomen. Contact your veterinarian if your cat appears to have a larger than normal abdomen, is behaving strangely, or seems to be losing weight."," and Types

552,Chylothorax in Cats,"Chylothorax in Cats

Chyle is a milky to slightly yellow fluid made up of lymph and fats from the intestines and transferred to the circulation through the thoracic duct (the main trunk of the lymphatic system, which crosses the chest near the spine and empties into the circulation system), and lymph is a watery fluid that is produced by the tissues of the body and which contains white blood cells, which are essential for protecting the body. Chylothorax is a medical condition that results from the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural (chest) cavity where the heart and lungs reside, with the main culprit being chyle.

Chyle is a digestive fluid that is formed in the small intestine and conveyed by the thoracic duct to the veins. En route to the veins, chyle can leak into the chest cavity, accumulating there and causing excessive pressure on the chest and its organs. Lymph travels through the lymphatic vessels, transporting lymphocytes (white cells that function specifically for cellular immunity) and fats from the small intestines to the blood stream. Commonly, when chyle has accumulated in the chest cavity, blockage or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels will occur, causing the vessels to dilate and affecting the tissue that covers the lungs and lines the inner chest cavity. This tissue becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, narrowing the space and constricting the lungs. Severe breathing problems may result.

In cats, Asian breeds such as the Siamese and Himalayan seem to have a higher number of cases than other breeds. Any age can be affected, but aging cats are more likely to develop the condition, and the condition is suspected of being associated with cancer.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms can vary according to the underlying cause, how rapidly the fluid has accumulated, and the volume of fluid present. Struggling with breathing is the first sign of a problem, but if fluid has accumulated gradually, the condition may have existed before the appearance of breathing problems. There are several other attendant symptoms that can be taken into account when looking for the underlying cause of the breathing problem. Your cat may present some, or all, of these symptoms:


	Coughing
	Rapid breathing
	Increased lung sounds
	Muffled heart and lung sounds
	Irregular heartbeat
	Heart murmur
	Inability to exercise
	Depression
	Anorexia and weight loss
	Pale gums and mucous membranes
	Bluish discoloration of the skin


Causes

The cause of chylothorax is usually unknown, but some of the instigators that have been found to cause it have been masses in the chest cavity (tumors), nodular lesions caused by a fungal infection, blood clots in veins, heart surgery, heart disease, and heartworm disease. There may also be a congenital element in the formation of this disease, and is suspected to be the case for some breeds. But in general, the cause is typically idiopathic (of unknown origin).

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need to draw some fluid from the chest. If chyle is found in the fluid, it will help your doctor to draw a firm conclusion as to the cause. Before fluid is withdrawn, your doctor may want to perform an ultrasound examination on the chest to check for masses in the internal chest cavity, and to check the heart and its structural condition to ensure that the correct diagnosis is made. X-ray imaging of the chest, before and after fluid has been removed, will present your veterinarian with a clear direction in which to progress. Further imaging may include a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan using a dye injection that will provide a visual point of reference as it travels through the system to reveal more accurately any blockages or obstructions.

 

Treatment

Treatment will depend on the underlying cause, but a pleural tap to remove fluid from the chest cavity and improve breathing will be one of the primary actions.

If the fluid has accumulated rapidly as the result of a trauma, chest tubes will be used to quickly relieve the pressure from the chest organs and prevent dilation of the lymphatic vessels. If accumulation of fluid continues, your veterinarian will need to continue the use of tubes to keep the chest clear, and will probably recommend surgery. The most common and effective surgical treatment is to bind the thoracic duct, and remove a part of the membranous sac that envelopes the heart. Continued use of chest tubes after surgery is likely until your doctor is confident that the chest cavity will remain clear on its own.

Also, depending on the underlying cause, your veterinarian may prescribe medications for treatment, post-treatment, or maintenance.

Living and Management

Ongoing care and maintenance will include periodic pleural taps to remove fluid from the chest cavity. Even if your cat recovers, you will want to have it evaluated from time to time for several years. Asking your veterinarian to do this during routine exams should be sufficient, unless your are advised to do otherwise. You will need to monitor your pet carefully for breathing problems or for the recurrence of attendant symptoms (see description of symptoms above). Chylothorax will sometimes resolve spontaneously, or after surgery, but for some animals there is no effective treatment that will resolve it."," and Types

553,Chronic Vomiting in Cats,"What Is Chronic Vomiting in Cats?
As a cat parent, it doesn’t take long to realize that cleaning up vomit is a common occurrence.  Occasional vomiting is normal in cats, but if it happens regularly, then it often has an underlying cause and should be investigated. 

Vomiting in cats usually follows drooling, excessive swallowing, retching, nausea, and a lack of appetite. Occasional vomiting or acute vomiting (lasting more than 7 days) can often be a normal reflex to hair buildup in the cat’s stomach or as a protective mechanism.

Chronic vomiting (persisting more than 3 weeks) is caused by many conditions and diseases. It can often be a true medical or even surgical emergency. If you think your cat suffers from chronic vomiting, seek the advice of your veterinarian immediately.

Symptoms of Chronic Vomiting in Cats
Besides vomiting, which may contain blood, cats with chronic vomiting often have other symptoms including:


	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Foul breath
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Decreased appetite

	Palpable thickened intestines
	
	
	Palpable masses in abdomen
	
	
	Diarrhea (bright-red bloody or black tarry stools)
	


Causes of Chronic Vomiting in Cats
Vomiting has many causes that may or may not be related to the gastrointestinal tract, which makes determining the specific cause frustrating for veterinarians.

Your veterinarian considers your cat’s age, lifestyle, and environment to help narrow down the cause of their chronic vomiting. For example, given their inquisitive and playful nature, kittens may ingest foreign objects causing gastrointestinal obstruction and vomiting, and cats allowed outdoors may have chronic vomiting due to bacterial or parasitic infections. 

Medium- and long-haired cats vomit more often because they ingest hair while grooming themselves. Excessive grooming causes a buildup of hair (hairballs) in the stomach. These hairballs are often passed undigested in the cat’s feces, or they are occasionally vomited.

You can minimize your cat’s excessive grooming behavior by routinely grooming and brushing them, feeding them a special diet, giving them hairball medication, and keeping them on a strict flea control medication schedule.

Other more serious causes of chronic vomiting in cats include:


	
	Infections (bacterial, viral, parasitic)
	
	
	Endocrine disorders (diabetes, hyperthyroidism, liver or kidney disease)
	
	
	Pancreatitis
	
	
	Electrolyte disturbances
	
	
	Obstruction (due to ingestion of a foreign object, cancer, or intestinal obstruction
	
	
	Certain medications or toxins
	
	
	Food allergies or intolerance
	
	
	Gastrointestinal disorders
	
	
	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
	
	
	Psychogenic disorders (due to chronic fear or stress)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Chronic Vomiting in Cats
Your veterinarian usually performs a physical exam to determine the type of care your cat needs,

Additional testing may include:


	
	Stool testing and urinalysis
	
	
	Bloodwork
	
	
	X-ray and ultrasound imaging
	
	
	Biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract or mass (through endoscopy, laparoscopy, or exploratory surgery)
	


Test results in cats with a chronic vomiting diagnosis may show signs of:


	
	Anemia (low red blood cell count due to chronic blood loss or inflammation)
	
	
	Erythrocytosis (high red blood cell count due to dehydration)
	
	
	Low proteins (albumin, cholesterol)
	
	
	Electrolyte disturbances
	
	
	Increased liver enzymes (ALT, ALKP)
	
	
	Increased kidney enzymes (CREA, BUN, phosphorous)
	
	
	Organ size (presence of tumors or foreign bodies)
	
	
	Increased thickness of the intestinal walls; changes in intestinal function
	


Further tests may include PLI/TLI/folate/cobalamin to determine absorption ability and markers of pancreatic inflammation, as well as stool cultures or PCR panels to determine the presence of infectious agents.

Also, if food intolerance or allergy is a known cause, your veterinarian may recommend a food trial for diagnostic and treatment purposes. This may entail a novel protein diet (consisting of less common sources of protein, such as fish, duck, rabbit, venison, or kangaroo) or a hydrolyzed diet, where the protein is chemically broken into pieces so the immune system is less likely to react. In some cases, this may be effective as the sole therapy. 

Treatment of Chronic Vomiting in Cats
The primary goal of treatment is to identify the real cause of chronic vomiting so that targeted treatment can be prescribed. For example, hyperthyroidism in cats can be treated with medications, diet, radiation, and even surgery. Surgery is often done when there is a known ingestion of a foreign object, evidence of an obstruction, or evidence of certain cancers.

Supportive care measures, such as IV fluid therapy or pain and antiemetic medications, are often prescribed. Medications such as maropitant citrate, metoclopramide, and ondansetron are used to treat the vomiting, help with nausea, and increase gastrointestinal motility. 

Appetite stimulants such as mirtazapine or capromorelin, vitamin B12 injections, or deworming agents may also be recommended.

It is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions throughout the treatment, as a combination of medications is typically required to treat your cat’s chronic vomiting.

Recovery and Management of Chronic Vomiting in Cats
The prognosis of cats with more significant or severe disease is often guarded until the underlying cause is determined. Specific treatment to alleviate symptoms and increase comfort can improve your cat’s quality of life. 

Conditions caused by infections or foreign body obstructions offer a much better prognosis and often need only short-term medications and care. Endocrinopathies, such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes, can be managed, but treatments often require lifelong supplementation and monitoring. 

Cancer often carries a much more serious prognosis, and while some cancers can be cured, other types can only be managed until euthanasia is suggested. Certain reasons for vomiting, such as foreign body obstructions, are preventable. So veterinarians advise pet parents to be vigilant and block their cat’s access to trash, hair ties, string, and other small objects.
Chronic Vomiting in Cats FAQsWhen should I be concerned about my cat's vomiting?If your cat has thrown up excessively, if the vomit contains blood or any unusual objects, or if your cat is showing any other symptom as noted above, seek veterinary care immediately.  Also, if your cat has a chronic condition such as diabetes or kidney disease, any vomiting should prompt a conversation or a visit with your veterinarian.

554,Chronic Renal Failure in Cats,"What Is Chronic Renal Failure in Cats?
Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) are medical terms used to describe when the kidneys are unable to perform their required tasks at a normal level of efficiency.

Kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. A cat has two kidneys located on each side of the abdomen. The kidneys serve to regulate the body’s balance of fluids, minerals, and electrolytes. They conserve water, protein, and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin.

CRF is classified into four stages, based on the severity of clinical signs and laboratory values. These are often progressive, though the timeline may vary:


	
	Stage I: Clinical signs are usually not apparent
	
	
	Stage II: Some clinical signs are noted
	
	
	Stage III: Many clinical signs are noted, and cats often appear to feel sick
	
	
	Stage IV: A majority of clinical signs are noted and cats are in crisis
	


CRF is often diagnosed later in a cat’s life, but it can develop at any time. Certain breeds—such as Persians, Abyssinians, Siamese, Ragdoll, Burmese, Russian Blue, and Maine Coon—are predisposed. CRF, if diagnosed at an earlier age, is often associated with a heritable condition. It can also occur secondary to an acute kidney injury, such as ingesting a lily plant.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Chronic Renal Failure in Cats
Clinical signs are often related to the severity of the CRF stage, meaning there are additional, more severe signs noted within stages III and IV rather than with stages I and II. Cats often exhibit symptoms including:


	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Intermittent vomiting
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Sores in the mouth
	
	
	Foul breath
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	


Causes of Chronic Renal Failure in Cats
The term chronic, as in chronic renal failure, means that the process has been ongoing and progressive, and cannot be reversed.

For some cats, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury or from a severe infection (including feline infectious peritonitis, feline immunodeficiency virus, and pyelonephritis). It can also occur due to ingestion of a toxic substance like antifreeze or lilies, or certain medications.

For others, CRF could be inherited, as with polycystic kidney disease (a specific type of renal kidney disease) and amyloidosis (a rare organ disease), seen in breeds like Persians and Abyssinians.

CRF could also be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, clotting disorders, and cancer like lymphoma.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Chronic Renal Failure in Cats
CRF is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis, looking specifically at kidney markers such as:


	
	Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a by-product of protein metabolism. Higher values can often indicate kidney failure.
	
	
	Creatinine (CREA) measures how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood,
	
	
	Phosphorous in elevated levels typically indicate kidney damage.
	
	
	Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) often fluctuate between high and low levels
	
	
	Calcium at elevated levels may be seen with kidney failure.
	
	
	Red blood cell count may indicate kidney failure, when low.  
	
	
	Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is an additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present. It can be used for early detection of kidney disease.
	
	
	Urine specific gravity is a marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually, the higher the number, the more concentrated the urine, and the greater the ability of the kidneys to conserve water.
	


Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including:


	
	A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine.
	
	
	A urine culture for cats in chronic kidney disease (CKD), as they are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections.
	
	
	A blood pressure evaluation because cats in CKD are more likely to suffer from hypertension (high blood pressure).
	
	
	Radiographs or an abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones or infarcts (areas of dead tissue).
	


Treatment of Chronic Renal Failure in Cats
Kidney removal is not an option since cats need their kidneys to survive. Dialysis in cats is an extremely uncommon treatment option. However, with early intervention, including routine lab work and annual exams, treatment of chronic renal failure is possible.

CRF can be managed with a combination of medications and proper diet. Your vet will be able to determine which treatment plan is most beneficial, depending on the stage of the disease. It’s important to note for all stages of kidney disease, water should always be available.

Since CRF affects a cat’s hydration, if any additional disease or illness hinders the cat’s hydration, it’s important to treat it promptly with IV fluids.

Recovery and Management of Chronic Renal Failure in Cats
Chronic renal failure is not curable and often progressive (although the timeline is variable). Cats diagnosed early enough can benefit from nutritional management and more frequent veterinary attention, which may include more frequent checkups and blood work.

Cats in stages I and II may be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a prescription diet specifically geared to help the kidneys by limiting the amount of work they have to do. Many cats can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months to years. 

Cats in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance:


	
	If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections can be given at the direction of your veterinarian.
	
	
	Dietary supplements may be prescribed to help with low potassium.
	
	
	Phosphorus binders may be prescribed to treat high phosphorus levels.
	
	
	Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can be given to cats with a poor appetite, vomiting, or nausea.
	
	
	Fluids given either intravenously—or underneath the skin—can help with dehydration. Your veterinarian can show you how to administer these fluids at home.
	

Chronic Renal Failure in Cats FAQsCan a cat recover from renal failure?There is no cure for CRF. However, if CRF is caught early and managed correctly, most cats that experience kidney disease can live a relatively normal life with some changes and long-term management.
What is the life expectancy of a cat with renal failure?Cats that have developed CRF have a much more favorable prognosis than cats suffering from acute kidney injury. Depending on the stage at diagnosis, cats in CRF can go on to live for several more years.
Is chronic renal failure in cats painful?CRF in cats is not a painful condition, but it can be quite debilitating.

555,Chronic Inflammation of the Bronchi in Cats,"Bronchitis, Chronic (COPD) in Cats

Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis occurs when the mucous membranes of the bronchi (the airways that transport oxygen from the trachea to the lungs) become inflamed. Typically, this leads to a chronic cough that lasts two months or longer -- a cough that is not attributable to other causes like heart failure, neoplasia, infections, or other respiratory diseases.

Despite extensive diagnostic efforts by your veterinarian, the specific cause of the inflammation is rarely identified. In addition, breeds such as the Siamese and domestic shorthair are found to be predisposed to this chronic disease.

Symptoms and Types


    Gagging
    Abnormal lung sounds (i.e., wheezing, crackles, etc.)
    Inability to perform routine exercises
    Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
    Spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope)


Causes

Chronic airway inflammation is initiated by a variety of causes.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count. Although the findings for these tests depend on the underlying cause of the brain injury, often the biochemistry profile may indicate abnormalities in the blood glucose level. Blood gases are also measured to confirm oxygen deficiency in the blood.

When fractures involving the skull are suspected, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are extremely useful to evaluate the severity of the brain trauma. These diagnostic tools also help in determining the presence of bleeding, fractures, foreign bodies, tumor, and other abnormalities involving brain. The ECG (electrocardiogram), meanwhile, is used to evaluate heart functions and rhythm.

Lastly, your veterinarian may collect cerebrospinal fluid sample to determine the level of inflammation and to confirm possible infections.



Treatment

Unless life-threatening symptoms develop, most cats do not require hospitalization. Otherwise, your veterinarian will typically recommend medication and oxygen therapy to be administered at home. Corticosteroids and bronchodilators, for example, are commonly employed to reduce airway inflammation and dilate the airway passage to facilitate breathing, respectively. Antibiotics, meanwhile, are usually prescribed to cats in case of lung infections.

Living and Management

Unfortunately, there is no cure yet available for COPD, but, with proper management, some symptoms may be kept in check. For example, weight control, a balanced diet, and proper compliance with medication will control the severity and progression of the disease.

Exercise is particularly important, as it helps clear the secretion present in the airways, thereby making it easier for the cat to breath. However, exercise must only be implemented gradually, as it can also cause excessive coughing. Additionally, a balanced diet will help keep the cat fit, thus improving its breathing, attitude and exercise tolerance.

Watch for excessive coughing and call your veterinarian immediately if it persists, as it may lead to a spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope)."," and Types

556,Chronic Diarrhea in Cats,"What Is Chronic Diarrhea in Cats?
The color, consistency, and frequency of your cat's bowel movements are indicators of their digestive health and overall well-being. Stool in a cat should appear brown and well formed, easily scooped but not too firm. 

When the food your cat eats doesn’t spend enough time in the intestines, the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water is diminished and it results in stool that is soft, mushy, liquid, or watery. This softer stool is called diarrhea.
Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea that reoccurs frequently over time. It is stool that is consistently softer than normal and continues for several weeks or longer.

Chronic diarrhea affects cats of all breeds and ages and can have many causes. Kittens, senior cats, and cats that are immunocompromised are most susceptible to serious complications of chronic diarrhea and should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

Small intestinal (small bowel) diarrhea and large intestinal (large bowel) diarrhea are two terms used to indicate what portion of the intestines is affected.

In small bowel diarrhea, there is a larger volume of stool than normal. If blood is present in the stool, it will look black or tarry.

In large bowel diarrhea, stool is usually smaller than normal, and frequency is increased. If blood is present in the stool, it will look bright red. Cats with this type of diarrhea may appear to strain to defecate.

Symptoms of Chronic Diarrhea in Cats
Symptoms of chronic diarrhea depend on the cause. If your cat has diarrhea (this may be soft-to-watery in consistency) that lasts longer than 24-48 hours, or if they are showing any of the following symptoms, they should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.


	
	Abnormal stool color (dark, tarry stool)
	
	
	Fresh blood in the stool
	
	
	Straining to defecate
	
	
	Increased frequency of defecation
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Increased or decreased appetite
	
	
	Decreased energy level
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Increased flatulence

Causes of Chronic Diarrhea in Cats
Chronic diarrhea in cats is caused by:


	
	Disease that affects the intestines or gastrointestinal system
	
	
	Disease that affects another part of the body, and diarrhea occurs as a result
	


Intestinal Disease


	
	Inflammatory Bowel Disease
	
	
	Intestinal parasites (Tritrichomonas foetus, giardia, worms, cryptosporidium, coccidia)
	
	
	Bacterial infections (E. Coli, Salmonella, Clostridium)
	
	
	Viral infections (feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus)
	
	
	Food allergies
	
	
	Vitamin deficiencies
	
	
	Partial obstructions (foreign material, intussusceptions, or masses)
	
	
	Abnormal digestion of food (protein losing enteropathy or pancreatic insufficiency)
	
	
	Triaditis
	


Nonintestinal Disease


	
	Hyperthyroidism
	
	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Liver disease
	
	
	Diabetes
	
	
	Cancer (lymphoma, mast cell tumors, adenocarcinoma, polyps)
	
	
	Pancreatitis
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Chronic Diarrhea in Cats
Keeping a detailed history of your cat's bathroom habits can be very helpful in diagnosing their diarrhea. This should include the length, appearance, and frequency of the diarrhea, and anything that seems to improve or worsen it.

The following tests may be used to diagnose your cat’s diarrhea:


	
	Complete blood count/blood chemistry test: looks at red and white blood cell counts, electrolytes, and internal organ function
	
	
	Thyroid test: checks your pet’s thyroid hormone levels; thyroid helps regulate metabolism
	
	
	Fecal test: checks for intestinal parasites and infectious organisms
	
	
	Urinalysis test: looks for bacteria, protein or glucose in the urine
	
	
	Infectious disease test: checks for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus
	


Depending on your cat’s symptoms and results of previous testing, your veterinarian may conduct more tests, such as:


	
	Fecal PCR test: checks for DNA of specific intestinal parasites, bacteria, and protozoans
	
	
	Absorption test: a blood test that checks how well the intestines absorb cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate (vitamin B9), and feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI), which ensures the pancreas is producing the digestive enzyme trypsinogen
	
	
	X-rays: are most often used for partial intestinal obstruction
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound: evaluates the intestines, lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, and spleen
	
	
	Endoscopy/colonoscopy: a camera-tipped tube is inserted from the throat or rectum to look at the surface of the digestive tract (stomach and upper intestines or colon). A sample of your pet's stomach or intestinal wall may be sent to the laboratory for testing. This test requires anesthesia.
	
	
	Biopsies: samples of your pet’s lower intestinal tract are obtained surgically. This procedure requires anesthesia.
	


Treatment of Chronic Diarrhea in Cats
Treatment of chronic diarrhea in cats greatly depends on its cause. Your vet will identify any underlying causes and will recommend specific treatments for nonintestinal-related diseases such as hyperthyroidism or diabetes, as well as those that are intestinal-related. Your cat may need digestive support medications or supplements such as probiotics or vitamin B12.

Depending on your cat’s condition, your vet may recommend a diet trial. Novel or hydrolyzed proteins are often the best option for this type of diet. (A novel protein diet is a diet containing only proteins that your pet has never eaten before). A prescription diet may also be needed.

A diet trial typically lasts from 3 to 8 weeks. Pets should only eat that diet during this time. Currently available blood tests for food allergies in cats are not as reliable as a diet trial.

What Should I Feed a Cat with Chronic Diarrhea?

Depending on test results, there are two main treatment options for cats with chronic diarrhea:


	
	Low-fat/high-fiber diet:  recommended for cats with uncomplicated pancreatitis, infections, mechanical obstructions, or thyroid disease
	
	
	Novel protein/hydrolyzed diet: recommended for immunocompromised cats, and those with inflammatory bowel disease, triaditis, and vitamin deficiencies
	


Ask your veterinarian what type of diet is best for your cat.

Recovery and Management of Chronic Diarrhea in Cats
Recovery time depends on the primary cause of your cat's chronic diarrhea. In some cats, general changes in diet and digestive support may improve fecal firmness. Cats with diarrhea caused by specific issues such as intestinal parasites, unregulated diabetes, or thyroid disease can have their diarrhea resolved within weeks of treatment, while others may need lifelong therapy to control their symptoms.

Are There Home Remedies for Cats with Chronic Diarrhea?

Cats with a chronic disease, senior cats, kittens, and pregnant cats should all be examined by a vet immediately after chronic diarrhea is noted. Also, if your cat’s diarrhea contains blood and is accompanied by vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, or lack of appetite, take them to a vet as soon as possible.

For those cats that continue to eat well, have a good weight, and have normal energy levels, a few options are available for you to try at home:


	
	Diet trial using an over-the-counter “sensitive stomach” food
	
	
	Fiber supplement or canned pumpkin
	
	
	Feline-specific probiotics
	


If these options do not help your pet's stool return to normal in a few days, or if additional symptoms arise, take your cat to your primary care veterinarian as soon as possible.

Never give your cat over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications for humans, like Pepto Bismol and Imodium, without first asking your veterinarian. These medications can have severe side effects in pets if not used properly.

557,Chorioretinitis in Cats,"Inflammation of the Choroid and Retina in the Eye of the Cat

Chorioretinitis is a medical condition which affects the eyes of cats. The term refers to inflammation of the choroid and retina, a layered membrane that lines the inner eyeball and which contains the light-sensitive rods, cones, and cells that convert images into signals and send messages to the brain to allow for vision. The choroid is located immediately under the retina and is part of the middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels. The choroid is also called the posterior uvea, which is the entire middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels.

Spreading inflammation may result in separation of the back part of the eye (retina) from the underlying, vascular part of the eyeball (choroid); a condition known as retinal detachment. Chorioretinitis may be a sign of a generalized (systemic) disease. Therefore, appropriate diagnostic testing is important. Secondary glaucoma, in which the pressure within the eye is increased secondary to inflammation in the eye, can also be a complication related to inflammation, and will also require treatment.

Chorioretinitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Chorioretinitis is not usually painful except when the front part of the eye, including the iris, is affected. Some of the symptoms that may point to chorioretinitis include vitreous abnormalities, which can display as tearing, bleeding, or will show evidence of the vitreous becoming liquefied (the vitreous is the clear, gel-like material that fills the back part of the eyeball between the lens and the retina). A condition sometimes seen in cats is invasion of the eye by fly larvae. Tracts from migrating larvae may be seen when the eye is examined with an ophthalmoscope.

Changes in the appearance of the retina when examined with an ophthalmoscope may include change in color, darkened or lighter areas, scars, and changes in the contour/surface of the retina. A close examination may show few, or small, lesions.

Causes

As you can see in the list below, the conditions that can lead to chorioretinitis are varied. Your veterinarian will need to consider biological, chemical, and genetic causes, just to name a few. There is also the possibility that a cause for the condition will not be found, in which case it will be classified as idiopathic (of unknown origin) in nature.


    Parasites
    Fungal      infections
    Bacterial      infection (e.g., Bartonella)
    Viral      infections (e.g., feline      leukemia, feline      AIDS, feline      infectious peritonitis)
    Protozoal      infection
    Autoimmune      disease
    Genetic      predisposition
    Metabolic
    Cancer
    Generalized      infection, such as blood poisoning or bacteria in the blood
    Toxicity      (e.g., antifreeze      poisoning, or adverse reaction to medications)
    Physical      trauma


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will use diagnostic tools that are both invasive and non-invasive in order to make a correct diagnosis of chorioretinitis. The non-invasive methods will include measuring your pet's blood pressure; screening a large area of the retina with indirect ophthalmoscopy (an instrument used for viewing the interior structure of the eye by use of a light reflecting mirror), or using direct ophthalmoscopy for closer examination of the affected areas of the eye. If results are not conclusive at that point, the need for invasive procedures will become a factor in pinpointing the cause for the chorioretinitis.

Your veterinarian may be able to make a diagnosis by examining a fluid specimen from the eye, which will be a fairly simple procedure, or there may be a need for a deeper examination, in which case your doctor will want to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (also called spinal fluid, the liquid that bathes the brain and spine) to look for infection, or for an indication of central nervous system disease or optic neuritis. Cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a procedure called a spinal tap, where a needle is inserted into the vertebrae of the spine and the fluid is allowed to collect into a vial. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing. It is a fairly quick procedure, but your pet would have to be sedated and might be affected for the rest of the day afterward.



Treatment

Treatment will be dependent on the physical condition of the cat, but is usually outpatient.

Living and Management

The possible long-term complications of chorioretinitis include permanent blindness, cataracts, glaucoma, and chronic eye pain. In the worst cases, death can occur secondary to a systemic disease.

The expected course and prognosis for chorioretinitis is guarded to good for retaining vision, depending on the amount of retina affected and on the underlying cause. Visual deficits or blindness may be a permanent complication if large areas of the retina were destroyed. Focal and multifocal diseases do not markedly impair vision permanently, but do leave scars on the animal's eyes."," and Types

558,Chiggers on Cats,"Chiggers in Cats
Chiggers are mites belonging to the Trombiculidae family. The larval form of this mite can affect your cat’s skin and cause itching, redness, and sores. They are also known as harvest mites, red bugs, red mites, or berry bugs.



Most infestations in the United States occur in the southeast and south-central regions, mainly in the summer and fall. Only the larvae (immature animals) are parasitic; the adults live in the soil and leaf litter. Chiggers will feed on a pet for less than a week before falling off. 

Causes of Chiggers in Cats
Cats can get chiggers through contact with mites which can be present in low-lying vegetation, such as grass, weeds, low bushes and plants, and leaf litter. The larvae crawl onto the cat, pierce the skin, inject enzymes, and suck up the digested contents. The larvae fall off the skin 3-5 days later, beginning the next stage of development in the environment. 

Symptoms of Chiggers in Cats
The most common symptom of chiggers in cats is itching. This may be accompanied by: 


	
	Skin redness
	
	
	Skin lesions 
	
	
	Crusty skin 
	
	
	Hair loss 
	


Some cats infested with chiggers may have no symptoms. 

 

Diagnosing Chiggers in Cats 
When your vet closely examines your cat’s fur, chiggers will show up as small orange specks. These are the mites or clumps of mites. Microscopic examination of these specks from skin scrapings or adhesive tape will provide a definitive diagnosis. 

Chiggers prefer to infest the face and base of the ears, but they can appear on any part of your cat’s body. 

Treatment of Chiggers in Cats
There is no specifically approved treatment for chiggers. However, most flea and tick products should be effective. Reinfestation may occur if cats have access to infested areas. 

Recovery and Management of Chiggers in Cats
Chigger infestations should resolve within a few weeks after appropriate treatment. Routine application of flea/tick products should prevent reinfestation. Once chiggers have attached to a cat, they cannot be spread to people.

559,Cherry Eye in Cats,"What Is Cherry Eye in Cats?
Cats have three eyelids and “cherry eye” is a term used to describe a prolapse (slipping) of the third eyelid. The two main eyelids are responsible for holding the eye in the socket and covering the cornea. The third eyelid, also known as the nictitating membrane, sits in the corner of the eye and covers the eye diagonally. This third eyelid is responsible for producing 30 percent of the tear film for the eye. The other part of the tear film is produced by the outer eyelids and the conjunctiva (the membrane on the inside of the eyelids).

The third eyelid is held in place by fibers, and for some cats, if these fibers are weak, the tear gland will protrude (stick out). This is often referred to as a cherry eye. Cherry eyes can occur in any breed of cat but are more common in Persian and Burmese cats.

Symptoms of Cherry Eye in Cats
As a pet parent, you may notice a thin film—or a small pink swelling—in the corner of your cat’s eye. In some situations, you may also notice some clear or mucus-like discharge from the eye. If this is causing your cat discomfort, it will rub the affected eye.

Causes of Cherry Eye in Cats
The protrusion of the third eyelid in cats typically occurs from a weakness in the fibers that attach the third eyelid to the inside of the globe. There are other conditions including the cartilage of the eyelid rolling out, or third eyelid mass that could look similar in appearance to cherry eye. It’s important to consult with your veterinarian to confirm the specific condition.  

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cherry Eye in Cats
To diagnose this condition, your veterinarian will do a thorough ocular (eye) examination. They will confirm if the structure that is enlarged is the third eyelid and rule out other issues such as an ocular mass, swelling or protrusion of the conjunctiva.

Common ocular tests performed include:


	
	Tonometry: This is a diagnostic test that involves checking the pressure of the eye. Your veterinarian will usually apply an eye drop to numb the surface of the eye and then a small pen is gently tapped against the surface to measure the pressure inside the eye.
	
	
	Schirmer’s test: This is a test that helps determine if your cat has developed dry eye secondary to the cherry eye. The test involves your veterinarian placing a small test strip of paper in the eye and measuring the tear production in each eye over the course of a minute.
	


Treatment of Cherry Eye in Cats
The treatment for cats with cherry eye is surgical correction. If a diagnosis of cherry eye is made and is found to be secondary to weakened attachment fibers, the sooner it is corrected surgically, the better chance the gland has to maintain its normal function. The longer the cherry eye is present, the more concerned your vet will be about inflammation and further trauma your cat can cause to the gland.

One of the surgical techniques involves creating a pocket in the conjunctival tissues to place the tear gland inside and sew the pocket closed to keep the third eyelid in place.

If dry eye is diagnosed, secondary to the presence of cherry eye, your veterinarian may prescribe eye medications to help with this or to manage any conjunctivitis (pink eye) that may also be present.  

Recovery and Management of Cherry Eye in Cats
Recovery time following surgery is approximately one week. There may be some mild swelling following surgery, but after a week it should disappear. The most common complication is that the third eyelid gland may become prolapsed again. It is important to let your veterinarian know right away in case a second procedure is required, or if a referral to a veterinary eye specialist is needed.
Cherry Eye in Cats FAQsDoes cat cherry eye go away?Cherry eye usually does not go away if it is due to weakened attachment fibers. Once your vet has ruled out other medical conditions contributing to protrusion of a third eyelid, the solution is a surgical correction.
What is the cost for surgery for cherry eye in cats?The cost of any surgery is always variable based upon the clinic you take your cat to, but the average cost of cherry eye repair for one eye can be from $300-$500. Always consult with your veterinarian for appropriate treatment estimates.
Is cherry eye in cats contagious?Cherry eye in cats is not contagious.
What happens if cherry eye in cats is left untreated?If the cherry eye is left untreated there is the potential for issues with tear production in the affected eye, and a condition called KCS (dry eye) may develop. If this condition occurs, then your cat will need eye products to help lubricate the eye and medications to try to stimulate the tear gland.

560,Chemical Imbalance of Urine in Cats,"Hyposthenuria in Cats

Hyposthenuria is a clinical condition in which the urine is chemically imbalanced. This may be due to trauma, abnormal hormone release, or excessive tension in the kidney.

The normal concentration and regulation of urine normally depends on an elaborate interaction between antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the protein receptor for ADH on the renal tubule (the tube that plays a  role in the filtering, reabsorption, and secretion of solutes in the  bloodstream), and excessive tension of the tissue within the kidney.

Abnormalities may also occur due to interference with the synthesis, release, or actions of ADH, damage to the renal tubule, and altered tension (tonicity) of the tissue within the kidney (medullary interstitium).

Symptoms

 Symptoms will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Some of  the more common ones include:


    Excessive thirst  (polydipsia)
    Excessive urination (polyuria) 
    Occasional urinary incontinence


Causes

Any disorder or drug that interferes with the release or action of ADH, damages the renal tubule, causes medullary washout, or causes a primary thirst disorder.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, with emphasis on determining the urine specific gravity.

The latter test reveals the functional capability of the kidney in its capacity to eliminate waste molecules without eliminating excess nutrients or water. These tests may confirm a urinary condition, with a low urine specific gravity of 1.000 to 1.006 g/ml, and excessive amounts of alkaline phosphates (ALP) in the blood serum, which would suggest hypoadrenocorticism or primary liver disease. High cholesterol is another common finding in cats with hyperadrenocorticism.

In cats suffering from pyometra (a disease of the uterus) or pyelonephritis (urinary tract infection), leukocytosis, a type of white blood cell, will be raised and will be present in the urine sample, along with abnormal amounts of protein in the urine, a condition called proteinuria. Proteinuria is common in patients with pyelonephritis, pyometra, and hyperadrenocorticism. If an underlying condition of pyelonephritis is present, the urinalysis will also show inflammatory sediment or bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). 



Other laboratory tests your doctor may want to conduct are adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level checks in order to determine the cause of the hyperadrenocorticism, if found. That is, your veterinarian will want to distinguish a pituitary dependent versus an adrenal tumor. Visual imaging, using X-ray, may also be included to determine if the kidneys or surrounding urinary tract organs are damaged in any way. An intravenous pyelogram is the most accurate diagnostic technique for a visual examination of the kidneys, ureter, and urinary bladder. This is a minimally invasive procedure which uses an injection of contrasting material into the bloodstream, where it then collects in the kidneys and urinary tract and illuminates  them on the X-ray.

An ultrasonography can be used to assess adrenal size, kidney and liver size and architecture, and uterine size (abnormal findings in the size of one or more of these organs may confirm an infection or reaction to infection). In addition, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to assess a pituitary or hypothalamic (which links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland) mass, which can be an associated cause of central diabetes insipidus or hyperadrenocorticism.

Treatment

Treatment for the hyposthenuria will depend on the underlying disorder. Even if your cat is urinating excessively, or is having trouble making it to the litter box in time, do not restrict your cat's water intake unless it is appropriate to the definitive diagnosis and has been recommended by your veterinarian.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits to monitor your cat's urine specific gravity, hydration status, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. Dehydration is a possible complication with hyposthenuria, and can quickly become a life threatening condition, so care must be taken to ensure that your cat is properly hydrated at all times.","

 Symptoms will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Some of  the more common ones include:


    Excessive thirst  (polydipsia)
    Excessive urination (polyuria) 
    Occasional urinary incontinence

561,Chediak-Higashi Syndrome in Cats,"Chediak-Higashi Syndrome in Persian Cats



Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects Persian cats with a dilute smoke-blue coat color and yellow-green irises (though it can also affect some white tiger Persians and arctic foxes), which causes the cats to bleed excessively immediately after an injury or minor surgery. Cats with this syndrome may also have an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia).



Despite the affects brought on by Chediak-Higashi syndrome, affected cats usually have a normal lifespan.



Symptoms and Types



A cat with Chediak-Higashi syndrome will bleed for an abnormally long period, often due to minor surgery or injuries. The cat's eyes will reflect a red eyeshine when exposed to light; excessive blinking and eye watering may also occur.



Causes




	Genetic inheritance




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam and take a background medical history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.



Other diseases will need to be ruled out, but if your cat fits the genetic type, your veterinarian will do a smear test for Chediak-Higashi syndrome using a sample of the blood that was taken.







Treatment



Your veterinarian will give your cat vitamin C to improve blood cell and platelet function and help decrease bleeding time. If your cat is having trouble with prolonged bleeding, a transfusion of platelet-rich plasma (from healthy cat blood) will be given to your cat to temporarily normalize the bleeding time.



Living and Management



You will need to remain aware of your cat's condition and maintain an environment that prevents accidents as much as possible so that your cat does not suffer an injury that would cause bleeding. Any scrapes or cuts could become a life-threatening issue, so it is best to try to avoid them. You will also need to keep this in mind when seeking veterinary care for your cat, making sure that the caregiver knows of your cat's disease so that precautions can be taken to prevent prolonged bleeding after having blood drawn.



Because this is a genetically acquired condition, it is strongly advised that cats that have been diagnosed with Chediak-Higashi syndrome be neutered or spayed immediately to prevent it from being passed on to offspring."," and Types



A cat with Chediak-Higashi syndrome will bleed for an abnormally long period, often due to minor surgery or injuries. The cat's eyes will reflect a red eyeshine when exposed to light; excessive blinking and eye watering may also occur.

562,Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats,"What Is Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats?
Cerebellar hypoplasia is a condition where a kitten’s brain does not finish growing and remains in an immature state due to a viral infection in the mother cat. The infection causes a pause in the unborn kitten’s brain development, specifically to the area called the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinated movement and balance.

The severity of symptoms highly depends on how developed the kitten is at the time the mother is infected. It is not a contagious disease, so if your cat is exposed to another cat with cerebellar hypoplasia, your cat is not at risk for developing any symptoms. The condition does not worsen over time to those cats that are born with cerebellar hypoplasia.

Symptoms of Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats
Kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia experience problems with movement and mobility.

If you think your kitten may have this condition, look for neurological problems like the following:

· Wobbling or swaying when walking

· Uncoordinated movements

· Abnormal gait (walking, trotting)

· Tremors

· Overstepping or “goose-walking”

· Difficulty going from a sitting position to standing, or vice versa

The brain damage is permanent but does not get worse with age.

Causes of Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats
The virus that causes cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens is called feline panleukopenia virus. If a mother cat with no history of vaccination is exposed to the virus during pregnancy and becomes infected, she will pass it to her unborn kittens, who are then at risk for developing cerebellar hypoplasia.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats
The diagnosis of cerebellar hypoplasia in cats is typically based on clinical signs.

Your veterinarian will assess a kitten’s well-being by performing a physical exam and studying the movements when the kitten tries to walk or change position. Your vet may also rule out other diseases by running certain tests, such as blood work.

Although there is no specific test to confirm cerebellar hypoplasia in cats, sometimes a brain scan or MRI can show a small cerebellum.

Treatment of Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats
There is no treatment for cats diagnosed with this condition because it is due to the brain failing to develop properly Most kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia will live a normal lifespan and can overcome any limitations the virus may have caused to brain development.

Recovery and Prevention of Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats
A cat with cerebellar hypoplasia can live a normal life with a normal lifespan. Most overcome their limitations and find their own way to navigate the world.

To prevent cerebellar hypoplasia in any future kittens, it is very important to make sure that your female cat is always up to date on vaccines your vet recommends.

The panleukopenia virus is commonly covered by core feline vaccines and can be given to cats before breeding. It is important to bring cats to the vet prior to breeding to make sure they are protected against this avoidable disease.
Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats FAQsIs cerebella hypoplasia contagious to other kittens in a litter?Since the mother is infected with the panleukopenia virus while pregnant, kittens within a litter are all at risk of developing symptoms. However, in some cases, only one kitten in a litter has cerebellar hypoplasia.
How long do cats with cerebella hypoplasia typically live?Kittens infected in utero with cerebellar hypoplasia tend to have a normal lifespan. They grow up to navigate around their limitations.

563,Cauliflower Ear in Cats,"The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy.


What Is Cauliflower Ear in Cats?
Cauliflower ear in cats is a condition that affects the ear flap, or pinna. It is a wrinkled-looking scarring of the ear flap cartilage that occurs after a hematoma, which is a blood-filled swelling caused by a broken blood vessel.

Since ear infections are a primary cause of hematomas, stray cats and cats that regularly spend time outdoors may be more at risk for ear hematomas and cauliflower ear.

Symptoms of Cauliflower Ear in Cats
If you suspect a hematoma or cauliflower ear in your cat, watch for the following signs:


	
	Soft swelling of the ear flap that may feel like a water balloon
	
	
	Narrowed ear canal opening due to swelling of the ear flap
	
	
	Wrinkled ear flap
	
	
	Scratching of the ears with or without odor or discharge
	


Causes of Cauliflower Ear in Cats
The causes of cauliflower ear in cats depend on the underlying issue, but they most commonly occur due to ear infections. Other causes may include:


	
	Infection, especially with ear mites
	
	
	Wounds to the ear caused by blunt trauma or fight wounds
	
	
	Persistent, intense scratching of ears by the cat
	
	
	Allergies that cause itchy ears
	
	
	Bleeding or clotting disorder
	
	
	Foreign body in the ear canal, causing increased scratching of the ear
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cauliflower Ear in Cats
Diagnosis of cauliflower ear is made by looking at the ear during a physical exam. If an infection is present, any ear discharge will be examined or cultured to determine the cause. An example of the discharge may be examined by placing it in immersion oil on a slide and looking microscopically to check for the presence of ear mites.

The discharge may be cultured if a bacterial infection is suspected. This is done by collecting a sample of the discharge with a special swab and sending it to a lab for testing or running a culture in the veterinary clinic. Finding the exact cause of infection ensures that the right medication is used for treatment.

Blood tests that check clotting function and platelets may be done to see if there is a bleeding disorder.

If allergies are suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a hypoallergenic diet or allergy testing.

Treatment of Cauliflower Ear in Cats
Treatment of cauliflower ear includes relieving the swelling caused by the hematoma by repeated draining or by doing surgery. Surgical options include making a small incision at each end of the swelling and placing a drain tube or cutting and opening the skin over the entire hematoma to allow it to drain.

If the hematoma is very small or the cat is not a good surgical candidate because of anesthesia concerns, repeated draining of the hematoma is a more likely treatment. Surgery would be preferred if there is concern that the ear canal could be closed off by scarring of the ear flap.

While a hematoma can resolve on its own if left untreated, the cat will be in pain as the ear heals, and the scarring and the resultant cauliflower-shaped ear may obstruct the ear canal. After the scarring has developed, it cannot be reversed.

It is also very important to treat any underlying infection or other condition that led to the hematoma in the first place. This may include oral or topical antibiotics, medications to get rid of ear mites, and pain medication.

Recovery and Management of Cauliflower Ear in Cats
It is important to prevent ear infections in your cat to decrease the chance of a hematoma forming. Preventing access to the outdoors will help avoid ear mites. There are also topical products to help prevent ear mites, such as Revolution, Revolution Plus, and Seresto.

If you notice any redness, discharge, or itchiness in your cat’s ears, contact your veterinarian so they can exam your cat. Permanent scarring of the ear flap often results from ear hematomas, but the damage can be minimized with prompt treatment. Not treating an ear hematoma can result in significant discomfort for your cat and could potentially result in scarring that closes off the ear canal and seals in any infection that may be present.

If you own or adopt a cat that has permanent scarring due to a previous ear hematoma, make sure to monitor them for any signs of an ear infection that may need treatment. Signs of an ear infection can include increased scratching of the ears or shaking the head, or redness, odor, or discharge coming from the ears.

Make sure to get your cat examined by your veterinarian if you note any of these signs. Otherwise, cats with the scarring of cauliflower ear usually do not have any long-term health issues related to the condition.
Cauliflower Ears in Cats FAQsDo cauliflower ears in cats hurt?The swelling and inflammation associated with cauliflower ear can be quite painful. In addition, the underlying cause may also create discomfort and should be treated to minimize pain.

564,Cat Tooth Abscess,"What Is a Cat Tooth Abscess?
A cat tooth abscess is an inflammatory reaction to infection from a dead tooth. This infection around the root of the tooth leads to destruction of the bone. The painful bony infection and inflammation can spread to the soft tissues of the face and create a swelling of the cheek or chin. The swelling may break open, and blood-tinged liquid or pus may drain out. 

Here are some definitions that can help you understand what your vet has to say about cat tooth abscess: 


	
	Abscess: an area of inflamed and infected tissue, usually due to a bacterial infection 
	
	
	Pulp: the collection of nerves, blood vessels, and soft tissue that live inside a tooth 
	
	
	Tooth root apex: the end of a tooth root that connects the pulp’s nerves and blood vessels to the rest of the body 
	
	
	Canine tooth: the larger, sharper tooth in the front of the mouth that is used for grabbing and biting. Though the name may make you think of dogs, cats have four canine teeth.

Symptoms of a Cat Tooth Abscess
Many cats with fractured teeth have no obvious symptoms and fractured teeth are found in a routine veterinary exam. 

The following symptoms may occur for a cat with a tooth abscess: 


	
	Facial swelling 
	
	
	Dropping of food while eating 
	
	
	Difficulty picking up food 
	



	
	Preferring soft food over kibble 
	


Causes of Cat Tooth Abscesses
The most common cause of a tooth abscess is a fractured tooth. When a tooth breaks and the pulp is exposed, it becomes inflamed and dies due to an invasion of bacteria from the mouth. While it is true that not all fractured teeth lead to abscesses, they all require treatment from your vet.

Teeth have an enamel covering on the outside that acts as a hard shield to protect the pulp. Cat enamel is very thin, only 0.1-0.3mm thick—much thinner than humans. Any fracture of a tooth is likely to cause exposure of the tooth pulp. Canine teeth are the most commonly fractured in cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose a Cat Tooth Abscess
Your vet may suspect a cat tooth abscess if there is a fractured tooth, facial swelling, or a draining sore on the gumline. To make the diagnosis, the vet will put your cat under anesthesia to perform a tooth-by-tooth exam of the whole mouth and take X-rays of each tooth above and below the gumline. 

Technically, sampling the tissue around the root is the only way to confirm a tooth abscess. But dental X-rays combined with the tooth exam allow your veterinarian to evaluate the mouth and make a diagnosis.4 

In the end, all fractured teeth are dead and require treatment by your vet to prevent an abscess from forming and your cat from being in pain.

Treatment for Cat Tooth Abscesses
Treatment for a cat tooth abscess with depend on the diagnosis. The most common treatment for this condition will be tooth extraction. Tooth extraction will most likely include:


	
	Pain medications to relieve your cat’s pain while waiting for tooth extraction 
	
	
	Antibiotics to treat the infection 
	



	
	Extraction with anesthesia and a local nerve block to numb the area, with stitches to hold the site together while the gum heals 
	


Recovery and Management of Cat Tooth Abscesses
After anesthesia for extraction of the infected tooth, your cat will be on soft, canned food for about 14 days. This is to prevent hard food from disrupting the stitches during the healing period. You will need to keep toys, hard treats, and other chew objects away from your cat during this time to prevent healing complications. 

The best way to prevent future abscesses is to have your cat’s mouth evaluated under anesthesia with a tooth-by tooth-oral exam and full mouth dental X-rays every year or as directed by your vet.5 Since cats don’t generally let us know when their mouth hurts, this allows your veterinarian to work with you to make sure your cat isn’t hiding any potentially painful areas. Young cats with fractured canine teeth can be treated with root canal therapy to maintain the structure and use of the tooth.

Other diseases that can affect cats and cause oral pain include 


	
	Tooth resorption 
	



	
	Gingivitis 
	
	
	Periodontal disease 
	


These are all more common in older cats and are also diagnosed with dental X-rays and an oral exam under anesthesia.  
Cat Tooth Abscess FAQsHow do I know if my cat has a tooth abscess?If your cat has a tooth abscess, you may notice a swelling suddenly developing on her cheeks or chin. These swellings can drain blood-tinged or pus-like fluids.
Can a cat tooth abscess heal on its own?Unfortunately, a cat tooth abscess cannot heal until the dead tooth is removed by your vet.
How can I treat cat tooth abscess at home?A tooth abscess requires veterinary care and cannot be treated at home. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication to keep your cat comfortable before the tooth is pulled, but that procedure will need to be done in the vet’s office under anesthesia.

566,Cat Skin Allergies,"Cats, just like dogs, can suffer from skin disease caused by allergies. Cat skin allergies can cause profound itching and pain in cats.

Finding the source of the allergy is fundamental to helping your cat’s skin heal and relieving their discomfort. And once the source of the allergy is found, it is important to continue to manage your cat’s allergy to help prevent the skin disease from returning.

Signs of a Skin Allergy in Cats

The most common signs of cat skin allergies are:


	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Scabs
	
	
	Ulcers and open sores
	
	
	Intense itchiness, which will appear as frequent scratching or overgrooming
	


Sometimes cats will also have ear infections, so they may scratch their ears a lot, have black debris in the ears, or shake their head. These cats will sometimes be extremely uncomfortable or in pain. Their skin may twitch, or they might hiss, growl, or move away when you pet them or try to pet them.

What Causes Cat Skin Allergies?

An allergy at its root is caused by the immune system reacting inappropriately to things that are not viruses or bacteria. When your cat has an allergy, their immune system thinks that a benign protein is a virus or parasite trying to attack it, which causes inflammation.

There are three triggers for skin allergies in cats:


	
	Flea bites / flea allergies
	
	
	Food allergies
	
	
	Environmental allergies
	


Many cats that go to the veterinarian for skin problems may have mites or ringworm fungus as a cause for their disease, so your veterinarian may recommend testing to rule these out.

Many cats also have bacterial infections on their skin from constantly damaging the skin, which will slow healing. Your veterinarian may recommend testing for infection and if so, will treat your cat with antibiotics.

Cat Flea Allergy Dermatitis

A flea allergy is triggered by a reaction to a flea’s saliva. Cats who live exclusively indoors are just as susceptible to fleas as cats who go outside because fleas can live anywhere in the environment.

If you are currently using flea prevention on your cat and your veterinarian can’t find any sign of fleas, that would suggest that your cat has an allergy to a food or something in the environment.

Cat Food Allergies

Most food-allergic cats are allergic to the protein in the food, not the grain source. This means that corn and wheat aren’t typically a problem for cats. The most common food allergies in cats are to chicken and fish.

Environmental Allergies

Environmental allergies are commonly triggered by pollens, molds, dust spores, and dander. These are all substances that can be found on the ground and in the air. We commonly call an allergy to substances in the environment “atopic dermatitis.”

How Do You Treat Cat Dermatitis?

Treating cat skin allergies involves several steps: relieving itchiness, reducing inflammation, treating bacterial infections, and finding the cause.

Reduce the Inflammation and Soothe the Itch

All cats that suffer from allergic skin disease are very itchy. At the first visit, your veterinarian may prescribe corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to alleviate the itch and inflammation in the skin.

For all skin diseases, bathing your cat can help to reduce inflammation and soothe their skin. Since most cats don’t like baths, you may want to try a product like a mousse or a dry shampoo for cats that can clean your cat while avoiding water. Ask your veterinarian to recommend the right product for your cat.

Treat Bacterial Infections

Many cats also suffer from secondary bacterial infections, so they will often receive antibiotics to treat the infection. Your veterinarian may also recommend putting an Elizabethan collar on your cat to prevent them from scratching their face or overgrooming.

Find the Cause of Your Cat’s Skin Allergies

If you only treat the itching, scabs, and infections without knowing what caused your cat’s skin allergies, you will end up back at the vet’s office again. Finding out the cause and then treating the underlying condition is the key to breaking the cycle.

How Does Your Vet Determine the Cause of Your Cat’s Skin Allergies? 

It is important to note that figuring out the cause of your cat’s skin allergy will require multiple visits to your veterinarian. Typically, your veterinarian will want to see your cat every two to three weeks until your cat gets better. These are the steps your vet will take to determine why your cat has skin allergies.

Checking for Signs of Flea Allergies

Flea allergies are quite common for cats. Your veterinarian will check your cat for fleas at the appointment. Interestingly, because allergic cats overgroom, they may remove all or most of the fleas present, so your veterinarian might not see any fleas on your cat. But just because fleas are not seen does not mean they are not the cause for your cat’s skin disease.

Your veterinarian will ask if you are using monthly flea prevention. If you are not, they will recommend a product that you will apply to your cat’s skin monthly. Using an effective flea prevention and assessing your cat’s response to it will help to figure out if your cat is allergic to fleas.

It is especially important to use a veterinarian-recommended flea prevention every month to control fleas. This will not only treat and prevent a cat’s flea allergies, but it will also reduce any itching caused by fleas.

Testing for Cat Food Allergies

If your cat is still itchy after treating their infection and using a monthly flea preventive, the next step is to test for a food allergy. Unlike people, there is no blood test for food allergies in cats. To figure out if your cat has an allergy to food, your veterinarian will prescribe either a novel protein diet or a hypoallergenic diet.


	
	A novel protein diet is one with a protein source that your cat has never had before. Venison, rabbit, and duck are common novel protein sources.
	
	
	A hypoallergenic diet is a food in which the protein source is broken down into small molecular pieces so that the body can no longer recognize it as a protein. Think of a puzzle that has an image of a pirate ship. When you take the puzzle apart, you can no longer see the pirate ship.
	


To diagnose a food allergy, your cat will need to be on the prescribed diet for a minimum of two months without eating anything but that diet. If the diet trial is effective, the next step is to add a new protein source to the food for one to two weeks.

If there is no reaction, we can assume that protein is not causing the allergy; if there is a reaction, we know that your cat is allergic to that protein and it must be avoided. Occasionally, some cats must stay on the prescription diet for life to manage their food allergy.

Managing Atopic Dermatitis in Cats

Atopic dermatitis (environmental allergies) is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that your cat has consistently been on flea preventatives, has completed a food trial, and is still very itchy. At this point, the treatment options include:


	
	Continuing to use corticosteroids
	
	
	Using an immunomodulatory medication like Atopica
	
	
	Blood testing for allergies to start immunotherapy (allergy shots)
	


Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatories, which means that they reduce the inflammation associated with cat skin allergies. Commonly used corticosteroids are prednisolone and triamcinolone.

Possible side effects include increased thirst and kidney injury. In cats, corticosteroids are usually quite safe, but they must be used at a dose that is as low as possible while still controlling your cat’s skin disease.

Atopica

Atopica, also called cyclosporine, suppresses the immune system cells that are associated with allergies so there is less inflammation. Possible side effects of cyclosporine are stomach upset and diarrhea, but it is generally considered safe in cats.

Allergy Shots

The final possibility for atopic dermatitis is immunotherapy, or allergy shots. Immunotherapy means that we are trying to change how the immune system sees the antigens (the proteins that cause an immune reaction) so that it no longer reacts.

This starts with a blood or skin test to figure out exactly what environmental antigens your cat is reacting to. Once the test has shown what your cat is allergic too, a laboratory makes a serum of the antigens.

You will give your cat an allergy shot several times a week. The goal is to vaccinate your cat against the antigens that your cat is reacting to. Immunotherapy takes about one year to see how effective the therapy will be.

It is important to note that there are no cures for allergic skin disease, and that many cats have multiple allergies. All therapies associated with allergies in cats are meant to control and manage the amount of inflammation caused by the allergy, as well as prevent infections and discomfort.

567,Cat Scratch Fever in Cats,"What Is Cat Scratch Fever?
For many of us, “cat scratch fever” brings to mind Ted Nugent’s ’70s rock classic. But cat scratch fever is more than just a catchy song; it’s a condition called bartonellosis. The responsible bacteria, Bartonella henselae, is most commonly spread to humans by a cat scratch and often results in a fever.

Bartonella henselae is very common in cats, especially young cats and kittens with fleas. Other animals, like dogs and rabbits, can also be infected. Cat scratch fever, or cat scratch disease, does not result in illness in most cats that come into contact with the bacteria. However, it can pose a risk of disease to humans through bites and scratches.

Symptoms of Cat Scratch Fever
Most cats with cat scratch fever are asymptomatic, meaning they have no clinical signs and appear normal. Very rarely, a cat may have signs of disease, including:


	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Transient fever, lethargy, and/or anorexia
	
	
	Reproductive failure
	
	
	Bacterial heart infection
	


Remember, most cats with cat scratch fever are not sick and do not show signs of disease. Humans, on the other hand, more frequently manifest symptoms of cat scratch fever. These are the most commonly reported:


	
	Pustule on the site of the scratch
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	


Causes of Cat Scratch Fever
Cat scratch fever is caused by a bacteria spread in the feces and digestive products of fleas, called flea dirt. Cats become infected when they have a flea infestation and scratch themselves with claws contaminated with the Bartonella bacteria from flea dirt. The same bacteria has been found in ticks.

Humans become infected with cat scratch fever when they are bitten or scratched by cats and that wound is contaminated with infected flea feces. Cats with fleas will often scratch and chew on themselves, getting the bacteria on their claws and in the mucus membranes of their mouths.

 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Scratch Fever
Cats are very rarely tested for cat scratch fever, as most infected cats never show signs of the disease. Occasionally, a cat that is going to be a blood donor may be tested.

Most veterinarians will make a presumptive diagnosis based on history of exposure. If they decide to test for cat scratch fever, they may recommend repetitive testing intervals to increase the likelihood of capturing the bacteria while the cat is shedding it in its blood.

What To Do If Your Cat Is Diagnosed with Cat Scratch Fever

If your doctor has diagnosed you or a family member with cat scratch fever, it is important to remember that while cats are likely the source of the infection, they are unlikely to become sick themselves. Most infected cats’ immune systems will handle the infection on their own and do not require a veterinary visit for intervention.

While most cat scratches do not result in cat scratch fever, it is important to clean any and all cat scratches and/or bites thoroughly. If you or your child are scratched by a cat and develop a bump on the site of the scratch, followed by swollen lymph nodes and/or a fever 1-3 weeks later, talk to your medical provider about next steps.

Treatment of Cat Scratch Fever
Cat scratch fever rarely requires treatment in a cat. Most cats' immune systems will manage the infection on their own without any intervention.

In rare instances where cats become sick with the disease, they may be treated with antibiotics. Sometimes treatment is pursued when cats that have been diagnosed with the disease are living with immunocompromised humans. Antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice, for a minimum of 3 weeks. Treatment can be challenging, as the Bartonella bacteria often develops resistance to antibiotics.

Treatment of Cat Scratch Fever in Humans

Most cases of cat scratch fever are self-limiting and resolve on their own without treatment. Some cases require antibiotic therapy. Uncommonly, some people may develop a more chronic serious form of the disease. These patients tend to be immunocompromised with an underlying disease that affects how well their immune system is able to function.

If you believe you may be suffering from cat scratch fever, talk to your medical provider about recommended next steps.

Recovery and Management of Cat Scratch Fever
Most cats affected by cat scratch fever show no signs of the disease and recover uneventfully on their own. The relatively few cats that develop a mild fever and/or swollen lymph nodes may require a few days of rest before their immune system manages the infection. If your cat is put on antibiotics for cat scratch fever, be sure to complete the course prescribed. Antibiotic therapy may last for several weeks.

Humans infected with cat scratch fever will generally recover on their own over a period of 2-8 weeks. However, lymph node enlargement may persist for several months. Individuals whose immune systems are compromised may develop more serious infections and experience more complications with longer recovery periods.

Prevention of Cat Scratch Fever

The best way to prevent cat scratch fever in your pets and yourself is to keep your cat on regular flea and tick prevention. Cat scratch fever is spread primarily by cat scratches and bites where the claws and/or mouth are contaminated with flea dirt. Eliminating fleas will dramatically decrease your cat’s and your own risk of becoming infected with cat scratch fever.

Should you be scratched or bitten by a cat, it is important to clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Even if your cat is not infected with cat scratch fever, there are many other bacteria species that can live in a cat’s mouth or claws.

Individuals who are immunocompromised by cancer, HIV, or other immune system diseases should still be able to have a pet cat. To prevent cat scratch fever, follow these simple steps:


	
	Keep all pets in your household on regular flea and tick prevention year round.
	
	
	Avoid letting cats go outside, where they have increased exposure to fleas and the Bartonella henselae bacteria
	
	
	Try not to encourage rough play with your cat that increases your risk of being bitten or scratched.
	
	
	In the event that you do receive a bite or scratch from your cat, clean the wound thoroughly with soap and water.
	
	
	Keep your cat’s claws trimmed so they are less likely to break skin in the event of a scratch.

568,Cats and Motion Sickness,"Gastrointestinal Distress Related to Motion in Cats

 

Humans are not the only species to get car sick. Cats also get a queasy stomach when traveling in the car (or even by boat or air).

 

Symptoms and Types

 

Cats show their uneasiness in various ways. The first signs of motion sickness may be:

 


	Excessive drooling (ptyalism)
	Crying out in distress
	Immobility, or acting afraid to move
	Vomiting or regurgitation
	Urinating or defecating


 

Causes

 

There are several potential causes of motion sickness in cats. One possible cause of motion sickness can be emotional (behavioral), and linked to a bad travel experience in early life. Many cats feel insecure when taken out of their indoor environment infrequently.

 

Diagnosis

 

Once neurologic, behavioral and other causes of vomiting are ruled out, the diagnosis of motion sickness can be easily made by the cat's veterinarian. The history of the cat's reaction to traveling usually points to the problem.

 



Treatment

 

Treatment of this condition may be as simple as making your cat familiar with going for rides in the car. If time and training do not help the situation, various medications are available. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) have a sedative action to slightly calm the pet during travel, as well as to reduce drooling. Other over-the-counter (OTC) medications that may be useful include meclizine and dimenhydrinate. These drugs don’t cause sedation, but can reduce nausea and vomiting.

 

Ginger is a holistic treatment used for nausea. It can be found in pill form (in health food stores), or even in cookie form. Ginger snaps and pills reportedly calm a nervous stomach when given about 30 minutes to an hour before travel. Consult with your veterinarian before feeding ginger to your cat in any form, to be sure that there are no indications that the ginger would be harmful to your cat, and to make sure that you are giving your cat the appropriate amount. In severe cases, stronger sedative drugs such as acepromazine may be prescribed.

 

A veterinarian should be consulted before any drugs are given (either OTC or prescription) just to be sure the cat is healthy, the dosage is correct, and that the medication won’t harm the cat.

 

Living and Management

 

Providing a safe, comfortable environment for your cat may lead to a better overall attitude toward travel. Opening the windows in the car slightly may help reduce air pressure inside the vehicle and allow for better ventilation. No food should be given for a few hours prior to getting in the car. Toys may help distract and entertain a high-strung cat. Taking frequent breaks may also help on long trips.

 

Prevention

 

Time and acclimation may go a long way to prevent motion sickness. You may need to stock up on certain medications to help calm your cat if and when it gets nervous. Your veterinarian can suggest safe and effective drugs to ensure that travel goes smoothly each and every time.

570,Cat Mammary Gland Tumors,"What Are Cat Mammary Gland Tumors?
Cat mammary gland tumors are formed by an abnormal mass of cells in the mammary (breast) glands. They can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Mammary gland tumors are most common in middle-aged and older female cats, but they can occur in younger female cats, as well as male cats.

Symptoms of Cat Mammary Gland Tumors
The most common symptom of a cat mammary gland tumor is a lump or swelling along the cat’s mammary chain, which is the line of breast tissue and nipples along your cat’s belly.

The mass may be soft or firm, widespread or clearly defined. You may also see ulceration (sores) as well as discharge from the nipples.

In cases of metastasis, where the tumor has spread, you may see other signs of illness, such as difficulty breathing when cancer is also in the lungs. Your vet may also see lymph node swelling.

In the later stages of malignant disease, cats lose weight, and a weakened immune system can lead to systemic infections. 

Causes of Cat Mammary Gland Tumors
The reason why a particular cat may get a mammary gland tumor is not entirely understood. Some cats have a genetic predisposition to develop cancer.

The risk of cancer also increases with age and exposure to carcinogens, which are cancer-causing agents like pesticides.

While we aren’t always able to fully control our cat’s environment and genetics, we can control the largest single factor that increases our cat’s risk of developing mammary tumors. That factor is exposure to the sex hormone estrogen.

Early spaying reduces your cat’s exposure to hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. Too many of these hormones can cause the abnormal growth of mammary tumors in cats.

When your veterinarian surgically removes your cat’s ovaries and uterus by spaying at an early age, it significantly decreases the risk that your cat will develop mammary cancer.

However, spaying is not a treatment for cat mammary gland tumors if cancerous disease has already spread throughout your cat’s body. This makes early spaying—before your cat’s first heat cycle—so important.

How Vets Diagnose Mammary Gland Tumors in Cats
Your veterinarian will be suspicious of this tumor based on appearance alone, but accurate diagnosis of cat mammary gland tumors requires microscopic examination of tissue.

A fine-needle aspirate (collection of fluid from the tumor) and cytology (test for abnormal cells) are noninvasive procedures performed in the vet’s office that yield quick answers.

However, these are not reliable diagnosis tools for this type of tumor, so a biopsy (tissue sample) will be required regardless of the cytology results. A pathologist (doctor who studies disease) will interpret the tissue after your veterinarian submits it to a specialized laboratory.

This biopsy report typically tells the veterinarian the following information:


	
	The type of the tumor – malignant or benign
	
	
	The origin of the tumor – what cells the tumor started from
	
	
	The grade of the tumor –  how normal its cells appear, with a higher grade being more cancerous
	
	
	The stage of the tumor – its size and spread
	


The stage of the tumor is also determined by further diagnostic testing, such as chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasound, and occasionally lymph node needle sampling. These tests investigate if the primary tumor has spread to other parts of the body.  

Treatment for Cat Mammary Gland Tumors
Almost all cat mammary gland tumors are potentially or already malignant when detected. That’s why prompt surgery to remove all affected tissue is critical in preventing the cancer from metastasizing, or spreading, to other parts of the body.

On top of that, while one mass may stay benign, another may have already become cancerous, so picking and choosing which mass to remove won’t do any good.

The veterinary surgeon may even recommend removing the whole mammary chain, along with the accompanying lymph nodes. 

Recovery and Management of Cat Mammary Gland Tumors
After surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be recommended. If a cure is the goal, chemotherapy following complete surgical removal is likely to be the best course, but it is important to realize that this type of tumor is rarely cured once it has become malignant.

Recurrence or metastasis (spread) is likely, and survival times are usually not longer than a year.

Spaying before the cat’s first heat cycle is the single best way to prevent the possibility of your cat developing mammary cancer.
Cat Mammary Gland Tumors FAQsHow long can cats live with mammary cancer?Most cats with malignant (cancerous) mammary gland tumors will experience recurrence of the tumor, despite surgical removal.

High-grade (more aggressive) tumors are associated with shorter survival time, which can range from weeks to around one year. Benign and low-grade (less aggressive) tumors can be cured.
Is mammary cancer painful in cats?Yes, it can be, as the tumors can grow large and ulcerate (make sores). Furthermore, metastasis (spread) to the lungs can make breathing difficult.

571,Cat Lipomas,"What Is a Cat Lipoma?
Lipomas are classically known as the “fatty tumor” of the animal world, and there is much truth to this nickname.

They arise from fat cells and are benign, slow-growing, noncancerous tumors.

While lipomas are common in dogs, they are encountered far less frequently in cats. When they are seen in cats, the patient is typically middle-aged or older.

Symptoms of Cat Lipomas
Although only one mass may be present, cats that do develop lipomas will often develop more than one.

The lesion is most likely found on a cat’s chest, abdomen, neck, back, and upper legs, though no location is off limits. They are found most often in the subcutaneous tissues beneath the skin, though they can grow on internal organs as well.

To the touch, lipomas in cats are most often soft and somewhat moveable, but they can also be firmer and more adhered to the nearby tissues.

They should be the same temperature as the nearby skin, and the skin above them should appear normal and without lesions.

When they grow quite large, which happens less in cats than dogs, they can outgrow their blood supply and become necrotic (tissue death).

Causes of Cat Lipomas
We don’t fully understand why cats get lipomas, and why dogs get so many more than cats.

Obese and overweight cats are more likely to develop lipomas than those with healthy body conditions.
How Vets Diagnose Cat Lipomas
Any new or changing mass on a cat should always be evaluated by your veterinarian, and a suspected lipoma is no different.

Your veterinarian will likely recommend a test called a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) and cytology. Most veterinarians will perform this test in-house, though it may be sent out to a reference laboratory.



For this test, the veterinarian inserts a needle into part of the mass to obtain a sampling of cells. The cells are “smeared” onto a microscope slide, stained, and prepared for microscopic examination.

Lipomas are often easily diagnosed by classic appearance under the microscope. For a confirmative diagnosis, a larger tissue simple called a biopsy is necessary. This is a slightly more invasive procedure requiring a brief surgery, though it’s still extremely safe.

Treatment for Cat Lipomas
Most lipomas only require monitoring. There is usually no reason for treatment of cat lipomas, as they pose no threat unless they are uncomfortable due to large size or an awkward location.

The growth of most lipomas is quite slow, which gives you time before making a hasty decision to have a lipoma surgically removed if you are on the fence.

Lipomas that are larger, fast-growing, or invasive into surrounding tissue may be appropriate candidates for surgical removal. Invasive lipomas make surgical removal more challenging, and they are likely to recur.

It is important to have an accurate diagnosis so you know that the mass is indeed a lipoma and not a malignant liposarcoma, as their treatments are radically different.

Recovery and Management of Cat Lipomas
Overall, the prognosis after a diagnosis of a cat lipoma is generally good and not a cause for alarm.

If you make the choice for a conservative approach—with the approval of your veterinarian—closely monitor the size and growth rate of your cat’s lipoma on a regular basis.

Record this information every three months. Documenting any changes in shape, firmness, or skin lesions is also important. Changes can indicate a need to reevaluate the mass with a biopsy.
Cat Lipomas FAQsDo cat lipomas go away?Lipomas in cats do not resolve or go away on their own, though they can shrink with weight loss.
Are lipomas dangerous for cats? Lipomas themselves are benign and do not metastasize to other locations in the body as some dangerous cancers do. This makes them rarely problematic for cats, though it is of importance to realize that lipomas themselves are far less common in cats than dogs.

It is dangerous to assume that a mass, even a squishy one that feels like a classic cat lipoma, is indeed a lipoma, as it may be a malignant tumor.
What does a lipoma look like on a cat? Lipomas are growths that are typically found underneath the skin. A cat can have one mass or multiple. Lipomas are somewhat round, and the skin above them is usually normal and healthy.

572,Cat Flu,"H1N1 Influenza Infection in Cats



The H1N1 variant of the influenza virus, previously known somewhat inaccurately as “swine flu”, is contagious to cats as well as to people. In addition, this virus is also known to be able to infect dogs, pigs, and ferrets. Though the spread of this particular influenza virus is no longer considered to be an epidemic of emergency proportions, it does continue to spread worldwide.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms may range from very mild to extremely severe and some infected cats may show no signs of disease at all.



The most common symptoms seen include:




	Coughing
	Sneezing
	Lethargy
	Lack of appetite
	Runny eyes
	Runny nose
	Fever
	Labored breathing




Some cats infected with H1N1 influenza have not survived, but the majority of infected cats suffer mild to moderate symptoms.



Causes



The H1N1 influenza virus is the virus responsible for the flu strain originally known as ""swine flu"" which first surfaced in 2009. The infection has been diagnosed throughout the world.



Diagnosis



The presence of flu-like symptoms in a human member of the household may prompt the suspicion of an H1N1 infection in a sick cat with similar symptoms.



A physical examination will reveal a pet with flu-like symptoms.



Definitive diagnosis in pets is usually obtained through PCR testing on swabs collected from the nose or throat or fluid collected from the trachea. This is a molecular test that detects the presence of RNA from the virus. Additional blood testing to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms may be necessary as well.



Chest X-rays may be recommended to evaluate the lungs for signs of pneumonia or other changes.







Treatment



There is no cure for influenza and treatment is symptomatic in nature. Nursing care may be required to keep the eyes and nose clean and clear of discharges. Infected cats may need to be enticed to eat or even hand-fed.



Antibiotics may be necessary to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections. Fluid therapy may be necessary to combat dehydration as well.



Prevention



Attention to good hygiene is the best way to prevent H1N1 influenza. Wash your hands thoroughly and often. Encourage children in the household to do so also.



Avoid contact, if possible, with people or other animals who appear to be ill."," and Types

573,Cat Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI in Cats),"What Is Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Cats?
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in cats affects a cat’s pancreas and occurs when most of the cells that produce digestive hormones don’t function normally.

The pancreas is a small organ located under the stomach, alongside the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum).

A cat’s pancreas has two vital functions:


	
	Producing insulin—the hormone that moves sugar from the bloodstream into cells.
	
	
	Producing digestive hormones—including lipase to break down fat, proteases to break down protein, and amylase to break down starch.
	


Different cells within the pancreas perform these different functions. So when these cells start to malfunction or stop functioning, cats can get sick in different ways. For example, when enough insulin-producing cells are damaged, cats develop Type I diabetes. And when the cells that make the digestive hormones aren’t working properly, cats suffer from EPI.

Is EPI in Cats Curable?

Unfortunately, there is no cure for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cats.

Once the pancreas is damaged to the point that symptoms of EPI develop, you must give your cat pancreatic enzyme supplements and other appropriate treatments for the rest of your cat’s life. But the good news is that dedicated pet parents can expect that—with appropriate treatment—their cat will go on to enjoy a long and happy life.

Symptoms of Cat EPI
A study published in 2016 details the most common symptoms of cat EPI and the percentages of cats in the study that showed these symptoms1:


	
	Weight loss (91%)
	
	
	Unformed feces (62%)
	
	
	Poor hair coat (50%)
	
	
	Anorexia (45%)
	
	
	Increased appetite (42%)
	
	
	Lethargy (40%)
	
	
	Watery diarrhea (28%)
	
	
	Vomiting (19%)
	


The frequency of these symptoms is somewhat different than what we’ve seen in the past and what is commonly seen in EPI in dogs.

The same study also found that most cats (58%) suffered from at least one other health problem in addition to EPI. When this is the case, additional symptoms are also possible. For example, a cat with both EPI and diabetes mellitus could lose weight, have soft stools, and drink and urinate more than normal.

Causes of Cat EPI
Anything that damages a large part of the pancreas can cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cats.

Chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is by far the most common cause of EPI in cats.

Other possible causes include:


	
	Birth defects
	
	
	Cancer affecting the pancreas
	
	
	Obstruction of the duct that connects the pancreas to the intestinal tract
	


Cats who eat grasshoppers can be infected with a pancreatic fluke (a type of parasite) that, in severe cases, can damage enough of the pancreas to result in EPI.

Genetics does not appear to play a big role in whether a cat develops EPI. No cat breeds are at higher risk than others, and the disease can affect cats of any age.2

How Vets Diagnose Cat EPI
The symptoms that are commonly associated with EPI in cats are also seen with many other diseases. To diagnose EPI, a veterinarian will need to run some laboratory tests.

Blood Chemistry Tests and Complete Blood Cell Count

Blood chemistry tests and a complete blood cell count will give a picture of the cat’s overall health and are used to look for problems, like anemia (a low red blood cell count), that are sometimes associated with EPI. Over half of cats with EPI also suffer from another disease, so a general health workup is necessary to reach a complete diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment.1,3

The Trypsin-Like Immunoreactivity (TLI) Test

The best test specifically for EPI in cats is the trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) test. Trypsin is a digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas that is normally present at low levels in the bloodstream.

In cats with EPI, blood-trypsin levels are significantly lower than normal.

The test is easy to perform by drawing blood, but cats cannot eat for 8-12 hours before the sample is taken.

Vitamin Levels

Deficiencies in vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) and alterations in folate levels (another type of B vitamin) are very common in cats with EPI. Your veterinarian will also send a sample to the lab to measure blood levels of these (and possibly other) important vitamins.

Treatment for EPI in Cats
Treatment for EPI centers around replacing the cat’s missing digestive enzymes, giving cobalamin supplements, and managing any other abnormalities. Some cats will also need folate supplements and antibiotics.

Pancreatic Enzyme Supplements 

Pancreatic enzymes should be added to every meal.

Powdered pancreatic enzyme supplements like PancrePlus Powder for dogs and cats, Thomas Labs Bio Case Pancreatic Enzyme Powder dog and cat supplement, and PanaKare Plus Powder for dogs and cats are easy to use and usually effective.

Tablets are also available, but they don’t seem to work as well as the powders.

Tips for Administering Pancreatic Powder Supplements to Cats

The powder should be mixed thoroughly into your cat’s food because it can irritate their mouth. Some pet parents say that letting the food sit for a period of time to allow “predigestion” improves their cat’s response to treatment.

Research doesn’t seem to back this up, but it doesn’t hurt to try if your cat’s condition isn’t improving as expected.

Initially, you will follow the dosage instructions on the label or provided by your veterinarian, but once your cat’s symptoms are well-controlled, the goal is often to find the smallest amount of enzyme supplement that works for your cat.

Pancreas Meat

Another source of pancreatic enzymes is … pancreas meat from another animal.

Pet parents can purchase the organ meat from butchers, raw pet food suppliers, and other sources, but the handling and feeding of raw animal products increases the risk of foodborne illnesses like salmonellosis for everyone in the house.

A commonly recommended starting dose for pancreas meat is 1 ounce mixed with each meal, but follow your veterinarian’s recommendation, because it will be based on the specifics of your cat’s case.

Tips for Administering Raw Pancreas to Cats

Pancreas meat can be ground up and frozen in appropriate portions and then thawed before being mixed thoroughly with each meal.

Whether they are delivered in powder form or via pancreas meat, most pancreatic enzymes are broken down in the stomach. A medication that decreases stomach acid, like omeprazole, may be used if this is a concern.

Cobalamin (Vitamin B12)

Most cats with EPI need injections of cobalamin (vitamin B12) every few weeks at the beginning of treatment. As their condition stabilizes, injections can usually be spaced further apart. Switching to an oral supplement may also be possible.

Folate Supplementation

Folate supplementation is sometimes necessary, at least in the short term. Your veterinarian will monitor your cat’s vitamin levels on a regular basis to make sure they don’t become deficient again.

Antibiotics 

Some cats with EPI also develop an overgrowth of bacteria in their intestinal tract, which can be managed with antibiotics (often Tylosin). Many cats only require antibiotic treatment for a month or two as their condition improves, but some may benefit from long-term therapy.

Recovery and Management of Cat EPI
After proper treatment is started, most cats with EPI start feel better quickly. Their symptoms usually improve over the course of a few days to weeks. If that’s not the case for your cat, discuss other treatment options with your veterinarian.

If your cat continues to respond poorly to treatment, it’s possible that they could be suffering from more than one health problem, and additional diagnostic testing may be necessary. Your veterinarian may recommend other treatments based on a cat’s symptoms and additional health concerns.

You can also ask your veterinarian if switching to a different diet makes sense.

EPI Cat Food Diets

There is no one type of diet that benefits all cats with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Because many cats with EPI also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease4, switching to a hypoallergenic diet like Hill's Prescription Diet z/d Original Skin/Food Sensitivities canned cat food may be worth a try.

A study published in 2016 details the most common symptoms of cat EPI and the percentages of cats in the study that showed these symptoms1:


	
	Weight loss (91%)
	
	
	Unformed feces (62%)
	
	
	Poor hair coat (50%)
	
	
	Anorexia (45%)
	
	
	Increased appetite (42%)
	
	
	Lethargy (40%)
	
	
	Watery diarrhea (28%)
	
	
	Vomiting (19%)
	


The frequency of these symptoms is somewhat different than what we’ve seen in the past and what is commonly seen in EPI in dogs.

The same study also found that most cats (58%) suffered from at least one other health problem in addition to EPI. When this is the case, additional symptoms are also possible. For example, a cat with both EPI and diabetes mellitus could lose weight, have soft stools, and drink and urinate more than normal.

574,Cat Ear Infections,"What Are Cat Ear Infections?
Otitis externa, commonly referred to as an ear infection, is an inflammation (swelling) of the outer ear canal. This inflammation may be acute (more recent) or chronic (long-standing). Otitis externa is a common condition in cats, less common in dogs, and it has a variety of causes.

The cat’s ear is divided into three main sections:


	
	The outer ear
	
	
	The middle ear
	
	
	The inner ear
	


The eardrum separates the outer ear canal from the middle and inner ear, which houses very sensitive structures involved in hearing and balance. Chronic and severe outer ear infections can eventually become more serious infections of the middle or inner ear.

The outer ear includes the pinna, or the cartilaginous triangle part of the ear that is covered by skin, and the external ear canal. The pinna is shaped like a funnel to help sound waves get into the ear, down the ear canal, and into the parts of the ear that process sounds. Cats have very sensitive hearing, partly because of a larger canal as compared to humans. A deeper canal allows better processing of sound. However, a deeper ear canal may get more dirt and wax, contributing to infection and irritation.

The ear canal is lined by skin and has varying degrees of hair. The deep part of the ear canal is a dark, often moist environment that can be a breeding ground for yeast and bacteria.

Symptoms of Cat Ear Infections
Cats with ear infections may experience differences in severity and length of infection. Most often, cats will have these symptoms:


	
	Head shaking
	
	
	Scratching the ears
	
	
	Head tilt
	
	
	Ear discharge and odor
	
	
	Swollen, red, and possibly ulcerated (having sores) pinna
	
	
	Ear pain
	


Depending on the cause, ear infections may affect one or both ears. It is more common for both ears to be affected.

As the infection and inflammation progress to the inner and middle ears, cats may show signs of incoordination and vestibular issues. The vestibular system is involved in balance, motion, and orientation. Problems with the vestibular system are similar to vertigo in humans. They may also injure the pinna to the point of developing an ear hematoma (pool of blood).

Causes of Cat Ear Infections
Otitis externa has many causes. Predisposing factors, such as abnormal ear shape (like in Scottish fold cats) may increase the risk of ear infections. Cats with too much wax production, lots of ear hair, or abnormally small ear canals may also be predisposed.

Ear mites are common causes of ear infections in cats. Kittens and outdoor cats are more susceptible, because mites can spread between cats and dogs.

Allergies are also a common cause of ear inflammation and infection in cats. Cats may have an allergic reaction to food, the environment, or both. Cats typically have signs of skin disease with allergies and, because the ear canal is lined with skin, the ears can also be affected.

Bacteria and yeast are typically secondary and opportunistic infections. This means the primary problem is not the yeast or bacteria, but these pathogens take advantage of the weak and damaged ear canal in order to replicate, thereby causing additional disease.

Healthy ear canals can fight off and defend against bacterial and yeast overgrowth, but that ability is lost when it becomes diseased. The secondary infections are some of the most common types of ear infections.

The other causes of ear inflammation, and things likely to create secondary infections include:


	
	Foreign bodies (grass awns or hair)
	
	
	Polyps
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Disorders of the skin
	
	
	Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease)
	
	
	Immune-mediated disorders
	
	
	Sebaceous gland disorders
	
	
	Aggressive ear cleaning
	
	
	Inappropriate treatments or medications not intended for the ear, such as hydrogen peroxide or alcohol can cause inflammation. Even some medications designed for use in the ear may cause problems if not prescribed by a vet, so it’s always important to check with your vet before using any medication on your cat. 
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Ear Infections
Veterinarians will suspect an ear infection based on a cat’s ear exam and the clinical signs. The ear canal and eardrum are checked for signs of inflammation, debris, masses, or other abnormalities. In more severe cases, the eardrum can rupture, which may change the treatments.

Veterinarians can diagnose ear inflammation and debris based on a physical exam alone, but more tests may be needed to confirm the presence of bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections.

These include:


	
	Cytology is the gold standard to diagnose ear infections. A swab is inserted into the affected ear to collect cells, debris, and discharge. These cells are then examined under a microscope for the presence of mites, bacteria, yeast, or inflammatory abnormal cells.
	
	
	Culture of the affected ears involves inserting a sterile swab into the affected ear to obtain a sample of bacteria. These bacteria are then grown in a laboratory setting and tested against other different strains of bacteria to see which type your pet is most sensitive to.
	
	
	Imaging and other tests may be necessary for chronic or cases that don’t respond to treatment.
	


Treatment of Cat Ear Infections
Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause of the infection, as well as treating any secondary infections. Cold laser therapy is often used, along with medications to help treat pain and decrease inflammation.


	
	Ear mites: Topical antiparasitic medications, like Revolution, are often used to treat ear mites. Some topical antiparasitic drugs may also be placed directly into the ear canal as well.
	
	
	Allergies: There are many ways to treat allergies, but the first step is to figure out if it is an environmental allergy or a food allergy. Diet trials may be used as well as specialized testing to find potential allergens. The goal with allergy testing is to produce an allergy vaccine with an allergen profile specific to the pet patient.
	
	
	Bacterial and yeast infections: These are typically secondary to an underlying cause, but they still require treatment. Most often, medications containing an antibiotic, an antifungal, and an anti-inflammatory all in one are put into the affected ear canal. Some otic (ear) preparations are intended to stay in the ear canal for 1 to 2 weeks. Others may need to be administered daily, or twice daily by pet parents.
	


Ear cleaning is an important part of treating otitis externa. Debris left in the ear canal can continue the infection and make treatment more difficult.

To clean the ear, fill the canal with the cleaner and gently massage, wiping out what you can feel in the vertical part of the ear (feels like an ice cream cone). You could do damage if you try to go deeper.

For appropriate and accurate treatment, make sure to talk to your veterinarian about the correct way to give medication and clean your cat’s ears. Many veterinarians recommend Epi-otic for cleaning, but always check with your vet before starting any medications or supplements. 

In more severe cases, oral anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids or NSAIDS) may be needed to decrease inflammation and treat pain. Oral antibiotics and antifungals may also be needed in severe, chronic, or recurrent cases of otitis.

Surgery may be needed for tumors, foreign bodies, or polyps in the ear canal.

Home Remedies for Cat Ear Infections

Ear cleaning at home can be an important part of helping your cat’s ears stay healthy and finding problems early.

While there are many over-the-counter products that claim to treat ear issues, the ear is a very sensitive organ. Many products are toxic to the ear and may result in pain, hearing loss, ulcerations (breaks in the skin), and even neurologic signs. It is always best to have your veterinarian diagnose and treat any ear issues.

Recovery and Management of Cat Ear Infections
Cats usually start feeling better within a few days of treatment. Once they seem to recover, it could be tempting to stop treatment, or cancel follow-up appointments. However, all medications should be used for the full treatment length (usually 7 to 14 days) and a recheck exam with cytology should be scheduled. Common causes of treatment failure include treatment that’s not long enough and inadequate therapy. It is important to learn how to clean and medicate your cat’s ears to ensure the product reaches the deep part of the ear canal.

The recheck cytology and veterinary exam is important because it may show one or more of the following things:


	
	The ear infection is better, but not fully resolved (even if the pet is feeling completely fine).
	
	
	The ear infection is resolved, and treatment can be stopped.
	
	
	The ear infection has changed and now requires a different course of treatment.
	


Some cats may have recurring ear infections, especially if they have abnormal ear canal anatomy or chronic predisposing issues, like allergies. Other issues, such as foreign material or ear mites, are more readily cured and do not recur.

In general, cats with ear infections have a good prognosis. Early intervention, fully completing any medications, and treating underlying factors are the keys to success.

575,Cat Ear Hematoma,"What Is Cat Ear Hematoma?
An ear hematoma is an accumulation of blood caught between the ear’s cartilage and skin. Most cat ears stand upright because of a strip of cartilage in the ear, which is covered with skin. There are also many arteries, veins, and nerves in this area. The external part of the ear that we can see is called the pinna.

Head shaking and scratching can cause small areas of skin to detach from the underlying cartilage, as well as damage the cartilage itself. The traumatized blood vessels leak blood into the space between the cartilage and skin, resulting in a puffy, soft, fluid-filled area of the ear. This swollen, blood-filled area can be limited to a section of the ear or entirely consume it.

Even once the ear has healed, scar tissue and fibrosis may form, giving the ear a wrinkled appearance. People often call this a cauliflower ear.

Symptoms of Cat Ear Hematoma
Hematomas usually appear on the underside of the ear. These fluid-filled sacs can be small—just a few millimeters—or involve the entire ear. Frequently, only one ear is affected. The swelling is soft, movable, and compressible, and may be red or painful to the touch.

Cats with ear hematomas may display the following clinical signs:


	Head shaking
	
	
	Scratching at the ears
	
	
	Head tilt
	
	
	Ear pain
	
	
	Ear discharge and odor
	
	
	Dirty, inflamed ear canals
	
	
	Swollen, red, and ulcerated pinna

Causes of Cat Ear Hematoma
The most common cause of ear hematomas in cats is trauma from head shaking or scratching secondary to otitis externa, or external ear inflammation, generally due to an ear infection. The fluid in ear infections is typically a mix of bacteria and yeast but may have an underlying allergic component.

Other possible reasons for the head shaking and scratching that causes hematomas include:


	
	Ear mites (to which kittens and outside cats are most prone)
	
	
	Trauma or injury from fights or bites
	
	
	Foreign material, polyps, or cancer that cause otitis externa
	
	
	Fragile blood vessels in some conditions, such as Cushing’s disease
	


An immune-mediated hematoma formation is also possible, but much less likely.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Ear Hematoma
An ear hematoma is typically suspected on physical exam. A veterinarian may notice a soft, fluid-filled pouch on the ear, usually with a history of head shaking or scratching. While the diagnosis of fluid in the ear is done on exam, a sample of the fluid may be required to confirm the presence of blood.

It is important to note that while fluid testing is required for a confirmed diagnosis of ear hematoma, it is not required for treatment in all cases. In fact, in some cases, draining the blood with a needle may make the condition worse and the ear will fill with even more fluid.

A veterinarian may perform additional tests to get to the underlying cause of the hematoma:


	
	Cytology of the ear canals is performed to look for yeast mites or bacteria, since most hematomas are secondary to ear infection.
	
	
	A complete otic (ear) exam will rule out foreign material or growths in the ear canal, and visualize the ear drums for any tears.
	
	
	Blood tests are conducted to rule out any underlying metabolic diseases.
	


Treatment of Cat Ear Hematoma
Many small ear hematomas resolve on their own if the underlying condition, like an ear infection, is appropriately treated. Often, treatment of the infection, anti-inflammatories, and pain medications are all that is needed to treat a cat’s ear hematoma.

It is uncommon for ear hematomas to resolve on their own without medical intervention. Most often, a small hematoma will continue to grow as it becomes more irritating to the cat, causing additional and more aggressive head shaking and scratching.

Some veterinarians may place an open drain, or cannula, in larger hematomas. This allows for any blood to immediately drain. Eventually, the cartilage and vessels repair themselves, and the drain is removed. As one can imagine, this method is messy, and pet parents should expect their pet to wear an e-collar and be confined to a room.

Another nonsurgical option is to drain the blood and inject a steroid into the space. The ear will likely refill with blood quickly, but the steroid may help long-term.

Medications for Cat Ear Hematoma

Some cats may need systemic antibiotics in addition to any topical treatments used for ear infections.

A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Meloxicam or Onsior, is sometimes needed for pain management as well as to decrease inflammation within the ear canal. These medications can have serious side effects and should only be used for short periods of time.

More serious cases of ear hematoma may require a steroid to decrease the inflammation. However, steroids have well-known side effects in cats, such as diabetes, so should be used as a last resort, and with caution.

Cold laser therapy may also help speed up the healing process.

Surgery for Cat Ear Hematoma

Surgery may be indicated in some conditions, and for chronic issues. The surgeon uses suture material to tack down the ear cartilage throughout the entire ear.

How Much Does Cat Hematoma Surgery Cost?

Ear hematoma surgery may cost less than $1,000, if performed by a general practitioner. However, a specialist may charge two or three times that amount, depending on the location.

Recovery and Management of Cat Ear Hematoma
Any infection present will likely need to be rechecked every 1 to 2 weeks until resolved. If not drained, the ear hematoma may take longer to resorb and go away. As long as the cause of head shaking and scratching is fixed, the hematoma should not get worse on its own—but may take weeks to fully heal. Recurrence is possible, depending on the underlying cause.

Surgical pet patients require recheck appointments, as well as incision management, for approximately two weeks, in addition to treating any other infections.

576,Cat Constipation: Symptoms and Causes,"Constipation is defined as infrequent or difficult defecation. This may mean hard stool; large, uncomfortable pellets; or no production of poop at all.

Cat constipation is a short-term problem. If your cat continues to be constipated, it can become obstipation (painful defecation) or even megacolon, which is the advanced stage of chronic cat constipation that is often non-responsive to medical management.

If your cat is straining when in their litter box, this could be a sign of a medical emergency—contact your vet immediately. The underlying cause could possibly be serious or deadly if untreated.

Check your pet’s symptom
Cat Constipation Symptoms
Symptoms that your cat is constipated may include:


	
	Little to no fecal production while attempting to poop. This is otherwise known as straining and is often a sign of pain or discomfort.
	
	
	Frequent visits to the litter box. With constipation, cats will often have a sense of urgency to try and have a bowel movement often hence they will frequent the litter box more than usual.
	
	
	Vomiting. Vomiting can occur from a sense of feeling full due to extra feces present in the digestive tract. It can also be caused by nausea from upset stomach or abdominal pain.
	
	
	Decreased appetite. Constipation is often uncomfortable and can cause nausea, thus cats will choose not to eat to help relieve themselves or to tell you they are not feeling well.
	
	
	Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is caused by the excessive amount of stool, gas, and distension caused by constipation. Constipation can also cause an intestinal blockage which is often painful.
	
	
	Decreased energy. Abdominal pain and gas causing pain can also contribute to less activity.
	
	
	Decreased interest in interacting with family. This is a common general symptom that occurs when a cat is not feeling well. Cats often isolate themselves to try and resolve their issue or as a way of telling you they do not feel well.
	


What Causes Constipation in Cats?
Cats can become constipated for many reasons, from stressful situations to health issues. You should always see the vet within 24 hours to rule out health-related causes or underlying diseases.

Litter Box Issues

Sometimes cat constipation starts with a litter box issue: maybe the box isn’t cleaned frequently enough or isn’t easy to access or there is a new type of cat litter in the box. Or if the litter box is associated with pain while attempting to poop such as cats with arthritis, or with something that’s scary to a cat, like the washing machine buzzer going off.

Your cat might choose to hold their stool instead of passing it in a normal amount of time due to the scary noise of where the litter box is placed. In these cases, your cat not wanting to go can quickly become not being able to go—thus constipation occurs.

To help your constipated cat, examine your litter box and its surroundings, and consider:


	
	Moving it to a quiet location with no noises or activity that would be scary to your cat
	
	
	Moving it away from your cat’s food, water, and bed
	
	
	Cleaning it more often to reduce smells
	
	
	Using the same kind of litter (brand, odor, and clumping ability) exclusively
	
	
	Switching to a low-sided litter box that is easier to access
	


Not Drinking Enough

Cat constipation could also be caused by not drinking enough water. Your cat’s reluctance to drink might be related to an underlying health concern such as mobility issues, mouth pain, or digestive discomfort. Take them to the vet to rule out any of these issues.

Your cat might also be reacting to an issue with their water dish, such as stagnant or dirty water, or even the type of bowl. Always rule out medical issues first, especially when it comes to dehydration. Then you can also think about:


	Using a cat water fountain with flowing water that mimics a stream or river
	Trying water bowls made out of other materials, like glass, ceramic, or metal
	Cleaning the water bowl more often
	Adding ice cubes or small toys into the bowl can promote more water drinking
	Hydracare™ is a supplement that is designed to increase a cat’s water intake

Many diseases, both acute (short-term) and chronic, can lead to cat constipation. These include kidney disease, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism. All cases of straining in the litter box should be evaluated by a veterinarian, because each of these illnesses can become serious or even deadly if left untreated.

Obstruction

A toy or other nonfood item can obstruct the intestines, preventing the passage of poop. This is considered an emergency. If your cat is constipated and shows any symptoms of obstruction, take them to the vet immediately. Symptoms of an obstruction may include:


	Vomiting
	Lethargy
	Refusing to eat
	Swollen belly
	Refusing to lie down
	Fever or low body temperature


The inability to urinate or straining to urinate is also an emergency for your cat; take them to see a vet as quickly as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment.

Not Enough Exercise

Inactivity can also lead to cat constipation. You should aim for at least 10-15 minutes of activity interactive play with your cat per day, or more if you have a younger cat or kitten. Some ways to incorporate play for cats can include:


	Cat trees to provide opportunities for climbing and exploration
	Scratching posts to allow cats to express the instinct to scratch
	Providing toys that mimic prey to attract a cat’s attention
	Smart toys that move on their own to motivate hunting and chasing
	Offering catnip helps to make activities more fun for your cat

First, your veterinarian will want a history of your cat. You’ll need to describe the symptoms, when they started, and other factors that may be related to your cat’s constipation.

Providing a full history is very important because straining in the litter box can also be a symptom of lower urinary issues and diarrhea.

After getting your cat’s history, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam. In constipated cats, a vet can often feel the hard stool, but not always.

Next, your veterinarian will recommend X-rays to evaluate the extent of constipation to determine the best initial treatment for your cat. Bloodwork is often required to assess underlying diseases that may predispose your cat to constipation.

Treatment for Cat Constipation
Treatment for constipated cats depends on the cause and severity. Constipation that is left untreated can lead to megacolon, a form of constipation that is not responsive to medical treatment and can be fatal.

The first step in treatment is to remove the obstructing feces, which sometimes requires administration of fluids or an enema at the clinic. Never give an enema to your cat at home, as human enemas are not safe for cats.

If the constipation is moderate or severe, your cat will need to be sedated for the enema or deobstipation (manual removal of feces).

The next step is to determine the underlying cause of your cat’s constipation and address it. You may need to make changes in your cat’s environment, like moving the litter boxes, cleaning the water bowl or litter boxes more often, or trying a cat water fountain or a different type of water bowl.

The vet may also recommend switching your cat to low- or high-fiber food and adding medication specifically for constipation.

But more often, treating any underlying disease, such as kidney disease or arthritis, is the most important treatment to prevent a recurrence.

Recovery and Management of Cat Constipation
Once the hard stool is removed, recovery is usually rapid. Unfortunately, if you don’t deal with the original cause, whether it’s treating a health issue or making lifestyle changes, then your cat is likely to become constipated again.

Follow the instructions provided by your veterinarian. Often the food changes or medications will need to be continued for life. Just because your cat is feeling better doesn’t mean you can stop treatment.

Pro Tip: Hang a calendar on the wall near the litter box to keep track of your cat’s poop schedule. This will help you be proactive at the first sign of a problem.
FAQs:How can you tell if a cat is constipated?A common sign that your cat is constipated is when they are producing little to no stool in a 24 hour period as well as straining. Straining is when they posture to defecate and little to no stool comes out.

Constipation can also cause bleeding from the rectum, small/firm fecal balls produced, or other general signs of illness such as vomiting, diarrhea, or change in appetite.  
Should I be worried if my cat is constipated and vomiting?When a cat has started vomiting due to constipation, this is a serious sign that they need medical attention. Vomiting is a sign of an intestinal obstruction likely caused by the impacted stool. If you notice these signs, contact an emergency vet immediately.
How often should a cat poop?Most cats poop at least once a day. Your cat should be having a normal bowel movement every 12-24 hours to ensure that their digestive system is working properly.

Symptoms that your cat is constipated may include:


	
	Little to no fecal production while attempting to poop. This is otherwise known as straining and is often a sign of pain or discomfort.
	
	
	Frequent visits to the litter box. With constipation, cats will often have a sense of urgency to try and have a bowel movement often hence they will frequent the litter box more than usual.
	
	
	Vomiting. Vomiting can occur from a sense of feeling full due to extra feces present in the digestive tract. It can also be caused by nausea from upset stomach or abdominal pain.
	
	
	Decreased appetite. Constipation is often uncomfortable and can cause nausea, thus cats will choose not to eat to help relieve themselves or to tell you they are not feeling well.
	
	
	Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is caused by the excessive amount of stool, gas, and distension caused by constipation. Constipation can also cause an intestinal blockage which is often painful.
	
	
	Decreased energy. Abdominal pain and gas causing pain can also contribute to less activity.
	
	
	Decreased interest in interacting with family. This is a common general symptom that occurs when a cat is not feeling well. Cats often isolate themselves to try and resolve their issue or as a way of telling you they do not feel well.
	


What "
577,Cat Colds,"What Are Cat Colds?
A “cat cold” is a general term that refers to a group of symptoms in cats. It is similar to the common cold in humans and usually caused by a virus that affects felines.   

Symptoms of Cat Colds
Cats with colds may have symptoms including coughing, sneezing, discharge from the eyes or nose, lethargy, and sometimes fever. For many cats, these symptoms are will go away on their own in about 7-10 days.

However, some cats may experience complications, such as a secondary bacterial infection or pneumonia. This can cause yellow-green discharge from the eyes or nose, which may lead to congestion severe enough that your cat can’t smell or taste. Cats with this condition may refuse to eat. 

Causes of Cat Colds
The most common causes of cat colds are viral infections. It is estimated that about 90% are caused by the feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus.

Feline Herpesvirus

Feline herpesvirus (or feline rhinotracheitis virus) is extremely contagious. It is commonly seen in situations where multiple cats are housed together (such as a rescue or shelter).

Similar to herpesviral infections in humans, cats infected with the herpes virus will carry it for the rest of their lives. Many cats will experience dormant periods where the virus is not actively reproducing. They may look perfectly healthy during dormant periods. However, after stressful events that suppress the immune system, such as being boarded or groomed, the virus may become active and cause symptoms including sneezing or runny eyes for a few days.   

Feline Calicivirus

Cats that are infected with feline calicivirus may show very similar signs to cats that are infected with feline herpesvirus. Also like herpesvirus, calicivirus is highly contagious.

Fortunately, both viral infections are specific to cats and are not contagious to people. Additionally, there are vaccines for both viruses, and these viruses are considered core vaccines for kittens and adult cats. Although the vaccine may not prevent infection completely, it can help to reduce symptoms and prevent serious disease.

How Vets Diagnose Cat Colds
If your cat is showing symptoms of a viral infection, your cat’s veterinarian will perform a thorough examination. It is important that you give your vet a thorough medical history about your cat, including the onset and nature of the symptoms.

Based on their exam findings, your cat’s veterinarian may recommend routine diagnostic tests to check for possible complications of a cold. These tests may include a complete blood count (CBC) to check white and red blood cell and platelet counts, a serum biochemistry to see if the internal organs are functioning appropriately, and chest X-rays to check for pneumonia or other conditions such as asthma or fungal infection.

An upper respiratory PCR panel may be recommended by your cat’s veterinarian in order to figure out what virus or bacteria is causing her symptoms. This test is performed by collecting secretions from the eyes and nose with swabs and submitting them to a laboratory, where they are analyzed for pathogens that cause respiratory disease.

Treatment for Cat Colds
Mild cases typically do not require any medical treatment, but there are some things that you can do at home to help your cat feel better while she is recovering:


	
	Keep your cat with you in the bathroom while you take a hot shower. The humidity can help relieve nasal congestion.
	
	
	If the air in your home is dry (during winter for example), use a humidifier to help relieve airway irritation.
	
	
	Reduce your cat’s stress during recovery. This may mean keeping her confined to a smaller, quiet room with all of her essentials close by (litter box, food, water, and warm bed) and using pheromone products.
	


Severe cases, or cases where a secondary bacterial infection is also present, often require antibiotics. Typically, this will be in the form of oral medication that is administered at home. If your cat is sick enough that she is having difficulties breathing or refusing to eat, she may require hospitalization for 1-2 days until she is stable enough to continue treatment at home.

Recovery and Management of Cat Colds
Most healthy cats are able to make a full recovery from a cat cold without medical intervention in about 7-10 days. If your cat experiences more severe symptoms and medical treatment is required, the recovery period may last longer and be harder, depending on how serious it was. Adding in at-home care (such as steam therapy with a shower, a humidifier, and reducing stress) can help with a cat’s recovery.

How do indoor cats get colds?Most cats are exposed to the feline herpesvirus or feline calicivirus when they are very young or by being housed in a shelter with other cats. Both viruses will stay in a cat’s system for life after they are exposed, meaning that the majority of the time cats will appear healthy but may start to show symptoms of a cold after times of stress.
Do cats get cold easily? Yes, most cat colds are caused by the feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus. Both are very contagious and easily transmitted between cats.
Does lysine help cats with colds?Lysine may reduce the severity of the symptoms a cat experiences due to the herpesvirus by interfering with viral replication.

578,Cat Asthma,"What Is Cat Asthma?
Cat asthma is a recurring respiratory (breathing) condition that is characterized by inflammation (swelling) in the lungs and narrowing of the airways. Asthma is caused by contact with an allergen such as dust or pollen your cat inhaled while breathing. Asthma can be made worse by stress. Cats affected by asthma may show signs of coughing, difficulty breathing, and wheezing.  

Although these symptoms may come and go, depending on your cat’s contact their allergens, asthma will not clear up without long-term treatment.

Symptoms of Cat Asthma
The most common signs include:  


	
	Coughing, which can look like gagging or vomiting  
	



	
	Difficulty breathing  
	
	
	Breathing that looks like it is coming from the belly instead of the chest  
	
	
	Noisy “wheezy” breathing 
	


Causes of Cat Asthma
Feline asthma is caused by an allergic reaction triggered when the cat inhales a allergen such as dust, cigarette smoke, pollens, dust mites, mildew, cat litter, and household chemicals. Even being exposed to candles, hair spray, and room fresheners can trigger a flare-up in sensitive cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Asthma in Cats
If you notice signs of asthma in your cat like difficulty breathing, you should visit the emergency vet. If your cat is coughing but still breathing normally, you can book a regular appointment. Once at the vet, cats with signs of asthma will usually require a basic blood panel, a heartworm profile, and chest radiographs.  

Some cats may also need more testing, which may include fecal tests for lung parasites as well as airway washes to look for the cause of the lung inflammation. In some cases, the diagnosis is very easy and straightforward, but other cats will require more extensive testing. Unfortunately, vets often are unable to figure out what started the process in the first place. 

Treatment for Asthma in Cats
Because the primary problem involved in asthma is the underlying inflammation, treatment is aimed at reducing this inflammation. It is generally not possible to eliminate the allergens your cat is inhaling. Even if your cat is not showing symptoms, they will need to continue the anti-inflammatory medication.  

Long term, the safest way to give this medication is using an inhaler, much as would be done for humans with asthma. Some cats are treated with oral or injectable anti-inflammatories instead of inhaled medication. The risks of side effects are higher with the oral treatments, however, so inhalers are generally preferred. 

Recovery and Management of Asthma in Cats
With proper care, the vast majority of cats with asthma will respond to treatment and experience only occasional flare-ups of symptoms. However, even if your cat’s symptoms seem to disappear, it is very important to continue with treatment because the underlying inflammation is still simmering and can cause long-term disease. When asthmatic cats are treated, they are likely to do very well.
Asthma in Cats FAQsHow can I treat my cat’s asthma at home?After diagnosis, asthma is usually treated at home using inhaled anti-inflammatory medications daily, with a rescue inhaler to use if there’s a significant flare-up. Some cats will be treated (at least short-term) with oral medications in addition to, or instead of, the inhalers.
Can asthma kill a cat?Yes. Just as untreated asthma in humans can be fatal, the same is true in cats.
What does a cat with asthma sound like?Some cats with asthma will cough and look like they are trying to bring up a hairball. Other cats will have an audible wheeze when breathing.
How much does it cost to treat a cat with asthma?The cost to treat a cat with asthma depends on which medication your vet prescribes, where you choose to have that prescription filled, and the severity of the asthma. In all cases, however, proper treatment will likely be much less expensive than a single visit to an emergency facility for a cat that is struggling to breathe.
Does my cat have asthma or a hairball?Asthma is a disease of the lungs, while hairballs come from the stomach. When cats with hairballs vomit their back is arched, and they vomit up fluid and hair, often while walking backward.  

When cats with asthma cough: their neck and back are straight and parallel to the floor, and they don’t usually move backward while coughing. If you are not sure which symptom your cat has, it is best to video the event to show your veterinarian what is happening. 
What triggers asthma in cats?Asthma in cats is triggered when a cat inhales an allergen that causes an allergic reaction. Allergens include dust, cigarette smoke, pollens, dust mites, mildew, cat litter, and household chemicals.

579,Cataracts in Cats,"What Are Cataracts in Cats?
Cataracts are changes to the clear lens inside the eye, causing it to take on a cloudy appearance. The lens is a translucent disc-like structure inside the eye. The lens helps to focus incoming light in the back of the eye on the retina. This picture is then sent to the brain to allow a cat to see the world around them. When a cataract develops, the lens is not able to focus the light down, leading to vision changes. Sometimes these changes are subtle, as is the case with small cataracts. Large, advanced cataracts may lead to blindness.

Cataracts are more common in senior cats as they age and their lens degenerates over time. They can occur in one or both eyes.

Symptoms of Cataracts in Cats

	
	Cloudy, hazy appearance in one or both eyes
	
	
	Bumping into furniture
	
	
	Difficulty finding food or litter box
	
	
	Reluctance to move around in unfamiliar settings
	


Causes of Cataracts in Cats
The most common cause of cataracts in cats is chronic uveitis. Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye that can result from an infection, disease, or trauma. Diseases like feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and toxoplasma gondii may increase a cat’s risk of having chronic uveitis and subsequent cataracts. Trauma itself, like a penetrating injury to the eye, can also result in premature cataract formation.

Cataracts can occur in cats of any age. While cats over age 10 more commonly get cataracts as a consequence of aging, younger cats can get them as well. Cataracts can even be diagnosed in some kittens due to malnutrition or an underlying inherited condition. Certain breeds are more predisposed to cataract formation, including Persian, Birman, Siamese, Russian Blue, and Himalayan cat breeds.

Cataracts can also occur in cats undergoing radiation therapy for cancer on their face or head. Some underlying diseases, like high blood pressure and diabetes, have also been linked to cataract formation in cats. In dogs, diabetes is the most common underlying cause of cataracts. In cats, diabetic cataracts are relatively rare.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cataracts in Cats
Cataracts are diagnosed by an ophthalmic exam of the eyes. Your veterinarian will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look at the lens inside the eye. Cataracts are not the only thing that can cause cloudiness inside the eye. Nuclear sclerosis is a common aging change that can also lead to an opaque color in the eye, but it does not affect vision. Your vet will be able to distinguish between the two conditions and determine with the ophthalmoscope if cataracts are present. This is most easily done in a dark room with the pupil fully dilated.

If your cat is diagnosed with cataracts, your veterinarian will run several tests to rule out any underlying causes. Blood work, a blood pressure measurement, and a urinalysis will likely be recommended to screen for concurrent conditions.

Treatment of Cataracts in Cats
Cataracts can be removed with a surgery called phacoemulsification. This surgery is done by a veterinary ophthalmologist with special equipment that works with precision to break down and remove the old lens and replace it with a new, artificial lens.

While there are no medications that will remove the cataracts, sometimes medications may be prescribed to delay progression of cataracts. This may be achieved by treating any contributing underlying diseases. For example, anti-inflammatory eye drops may be used to manage uveitis and reduce the risk of secondary glaucoma (high pressure in the eye) that can contribute to cataract progression.

Recovery and Management of Cataracts in Cats
In cats who are good surgical candidates, cataracts can be cured with surgical removal. For non-surgical candidates, cataracts can be managed by reducing inflammation in the eye that may lead to secondary problems.

For many cats, cataracts themselves are not painful and may not require any additional management aside from regular monitoring. If an underlying condition like uveitis, high blood pressure, or ocular pressure (glaucoma) is present, your veterinarian may recommend regular follow-up visits to track progression.

Progression of cataracts can vary depending on the cause, how quickly intervention is sought, and the age of the patient. Sometimes cataracts remain small and do not change much over long periods of time, while other cats may experience sudden blindness.

A young kitten with a juvenile cataract that was a consequence of a nutritional deficiency may have very little change to their small cataract and continue to have normal vision as long as their diet is corrected. A senior cat with elevated blood pressure and retinal issues with secondary cataracts may experience sudden blindness from cataract progression and/or retinal detachment. Your veterinarian will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect regarding the timeline, depending on the severity and type of cataract that is diagnosed.

If your cat is diagnosed with cataracts and has lost some vision, it is important that you make sure they have easy access to all of their resources. Avoid putting necessary resources, like food and water, on high or unstable surfaces. Keep the food and water bowls and litter box in the same place, so your cat is not struggling to find them. Prevent access to potentially dangerous areas of the household like staircases or swimming pools. Avoid moving your furniture around and increasing disorientation in your vision-impaired cat.

Remember, cats can live wonderful, full lives even if they do lose the ability to see.
Cataracts in Cats FAQSAt what age do cats typically get cataracts?Cataracts are most common in senior cats over the age of 10. However, cats of any age can get cataracts in one or both eyes.
What are the early signs of cataracts in cats?Some pet parents may notice a cloudy appearance inside the eye, while others may observe behavior changes consistent with vision loss.

580,Cat Acne,"What Is Cat Acne? 
If you’ve ever noticed red bumps, black dots, or dirt on your cat’s chin, your cat may struggle with cat acne, or cat chin acne.  

At its basic definition, cat chin acne is a disease in which the hair follicles—typically the ones on a cat’s chin—produce too much keratin and become plugged up. This results in red bumps, blackheads, and infected pimple-like lesions.

Cats can have a single, isolated bout of cat acne, or it may be chronic.

Chronic or severely affected cats may have so many plugged follicles that they fuse together, and form swollen, painful crusts. As the lesions get bigger, the follicles are more prone to rupture, which is a sore and often messy experience. Cat acne can also lead to chronic hair loss in the affected area.

Felines of all ages can develop acne, since it’s not believed to be related to sex hormones. Additionally, cat acne affects males and females of all breeds, as well as both and neutered and unneutered cats.

Cats that eat and/or drink out of plastic food bowls may also be at risk of cat acne, as it may stem as a form of plastic allergy.

Symptoms of Cat Acne
Symptoms of cat acne include:


	
	Redness or swelling
	
	
	Bumps and pustules
	
	
	Scabs and crusts
	
	
	Pain around the chin
	


Causes of Cat Acne
Cat acne is a poorly understood disorder that’s related to the overproduction of keratin, a key structure that makes up the outer layer of skin.

For several reasons, this excess keratin becomes trapped, causing the formation of blackheads, or comedones. When these blackheads become infected with bacteria, they form pustules that look like pimples.

Cat chin acne is believed to be associated with:


	
	Poor grooming
	
	
	Excessive sebum (oil) and keratin production
	
	
	The skin’s immune-barrier function
	


Regardless of the underlying issue, hair follicles become blocked, resulting in infection.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Acne
Veterinarians diagnose cat acne based on physical exam findings, your cat’s medical history, and the elimination of other possible skin conditions.

A skin scraping and looking at a small sample of skin under the microscope may be needed to help rule out other causes, such as mange, various skin tumors, and a condition called eosinophilic granuloma complex.

Treatment of Cat Acne
Never pick at your cat’s acne. Picking will only worsen the condition and potentially cause more pain and even infection.

Cat acne treatment begins with taking any plastic food or water bowls and changing them out immediately for stainless steel. This, along with supportive care, may be all that is needed to resolve cat acne.

Treatment may also involve the use of oral or injectable antibiotics and topical shampoo or wipes.

If your cat’s skin begins to clear, the shampoos and topical treatments can gradually be stopped.

If the outbreaks of cat acne reoccur, your veterinarian will help develop an appropriate maintenance routine to keep your cat’s chin as clear as possible.

Maintenance cleansing with gentle scrubbing has been successful for many cats because it extends the amount of time between episodes and treatment.

For most patients, improved hygiene—including washing your cat’s face and wiping your cat’s chin—is core to the treatment plan for cat acne. Your vet may recommend cleaning their face with benzoyl peroxide facial wipes, but you need to get wipes specifically made for cats, as human wipes are too strong.

Clipping the nearby fur can also cut down the number of bacteria.

Recovery and Management of Cat Acne
Cat acne is typically a superficial problem and not usually one that will have serious impacts on your cat’s overall health. Most cases of cat acne are relatively harmless and respond well with improved hygiene.

Cat chin acne does become painful if it reaches the point where lesions swell and/or scab. If this occurs, more aggressive treatment is required to manage your cat’s acne.

Prevention of Cat Acne
Cat acne can often be prevented by using non-plastic food and water bowls for your feline friend. Keep their chin clean, especially if you notice any food residue or that your cat isn’t washing themselves as often.

If you see any signs of pimples or blackheads, addressing them early will make sure the condition is unlikely to progress.

581,Cat Abscesses,"What Are Cat Abscesses?
Cat abscesses are areas of infection that typically occur on the skin and underlying tissues. Abscesses are usually caused by bacteria entering the skin through a bite or puncture wound.
Health ToolsNot sure whether to see a vet?Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps.
Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of a Cat Abscess
The first and most obvious symptom of many abscesses is the actual wound, whether it’s a bite mark, a puncture wound, or a claw mark. You may also see matted hair around the wound. The matting is caused by pus oozing from the abscess.

Symptoms of a cat abscess include:


	
	Swelling
	
	
	Pain
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	A foul-smelling discharge or pus (with or without blood)
	
	
	Limping if the abscess is in one of the cat’s legs.
	


Causes of Cat Abscesses
Cats can be very territorial creatures, but unneutered males are especially known for not wanting other animals in their space. When a cat feels that an intruder has entered his space, he may become aggressive and start a fight. In addition to territorial fights, indoor cats may fight if there are social conflicts within the home.

Any time a cat suffers a bite or claw wound during a fight, bacteria from the biting cat’s mouth or claw is introduced into the wounded area. This can result in a localized infection in the skin.

An abscess is a pocket, or collection, of pus that forms under the skin as a result of the infection.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cat Abscesses
If your vet suspects an abscess on your cat, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the cat’s health history and discussing any recent incidents of biting or fighting. The vet will also ask if you’ve noticed any pain, swelling, or foul-smelling discharge.

Blood Chemistry Test

Depending on your cat’s health history and the physical exam, your vet may also perform a blood chemistry test to have a clear overall picture of your cat’s health.

Cytology

During this test, your vet will collect a small sample of the discharge with a very fine needle and a sterile swab. The discharge will be examined under a microscope and perhaps cultured to identify the type of bacteria.

Treatment for Cat Abscesses
Treatment of a cat abscess is straightforward and usually includes:


	
	If an abscess is already draining, the area will be thoroughly cleaned.
	
	
	Abscesses that have not started draining may require the cat be sedated for a simple surgery.
	
	
	Antibiotics.
	
	
	At-home cleaning and care will be required as the area heals. Your veterinarian will provide instructions tailored to your cat’s needs and severity of infection. 
	


Recovery and Management of Cat Abscesses
Most cat abscesses heal within two weeks with appropriate treatment. If an abscess is not healing as expected, your cat may have a resistant bacterial infection or may have feline leukemia (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which can affect the immune system and healing.

To prevent future abscesses, male cats should be neutered to decrease territorial behavior and fighting. If your cat spends a lot of time outdoors, ask your veterinarian if he or she should receive a FeLV vaccine.
Cat Abscesses FAQsShould I take my cat to the veterinarian for an abscess?Yes, your veterinarian can clean the area, prescribe antibiotics, and instruct you on proper home care.
How can I treat an abscess on my cat at home?Follow the treatment plan prescribed by the vet. This may include giving prescribed medications and keeping the area clean as tolerated by your cat.
Can an abscess kill a cat?It’s very uncommon for an abscess to be fatal. However, a cat’s prognosis depends on the location of the abscess, the extent of infection, and type of bacteria involved.
Will a cat abscess heal on its own?No. Although an abscess may not require medicine, it does require proper treatment to heal completely.
What happens if a cat abscess goes untreated?The infection can extend beyond the initial wound and potentially spread throughout the body, making the cat quite ill. An untreated abscess may also result in an antibiotic-resistant infection.

582,Cardiac Muscle Tumor in Cats,"Rhabdomyoma in Cats

A rhabdomyoma is an extremely rare, benign, non-spreading, cardiac muscle tumor that occurs only half as often as its malignant version: rhabdomyosarcomas, an invasive, metastasizing (spreading) tumor.

Rhabdomyomas are usually found in the heart, and are suspected of being congenital in origin (present at birth). This type of tumor does not become malignant, nor does it metastasize through the body. They are very rarely found outside of the heart, but do occur in other places of the body on occasion. They have been reported in the ears of cats.

Rhabdomyomas can affect both cats and dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types


    Rhabdomyoma 	in the heart:
    
        Usually 		no symptoms
        Rarely, 		there will be signs of right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) 		due to obstruction
    
    
    Rhabdomyoma 	outside the heart:
    
        Localized 		swelling
    
    

 
Causes

Idiopathic (unknown).

Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. From there, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your pet, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will use the results of the bloodwork to confirm, or rule out, other diseases. Bloodwork will typically appear normal in patients with a rhabdomyoma, since the tumor is relatively harmless.

X-ray imaging, and an echocardiogram of the heart may help your veterinarian to diagnose a rhabdomyoma. Additional examination using an electrocardiogram will note heart arrhythmias (rhythm abnormalities). For a definitive diagnosis, an examination of tissue from the tumor (biopsy) can be performed.

Treatment

Treatment is not usually necessary for a rhabdomyoma in the heart, since surgery of the heart would carry more risk than any benefit it might provide. But for rhabdomyomas located in an area other than the heart, surgery to remove them should be fairly uncomplicated since they are not very invasive.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-ups for the first three months after your cat has been discharged in order to do progress checks. Follow-up visits may then be scheduled at three to six month intervals for another year. The concern is that rhabdomyomas in the heart may lead to right-sided congestive heart failure due to obstruction of blood flow."," and Types

583,Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats,"What Is Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats?
To move blood through the body, the four chambers of the heart must expand and contract in a precise way. While the heartbeat can speed up or slow down depending on the needs of the body, it does so with a consistent rhythm controlled by electric signals that move in a very specific path through the heart muscles. When this path is interrupted or when signals are generated abnormally, it results in a cardiac arrhythmia.

Arrhythmias are relatively uncommon in cats. A recent study found arrhythmias in only 2.6% of cats. Most cardiac arrhythmias in cats indicate structural issues in the heart or systemic disease, though some irregular heartbeats can be found in normal heart function.

When arrhythmias are due to disease, the heart’s chambers can contract out of sync, and blood will not flow through the lungs and to the body properly. This leads to decreased oxygen in the tissues and can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, chest, and abdomen. 

Cats are very good at hiding signs of disease, so even when arrhythmias are due to illness, symptoms are often hard to spot until the situation is severe. Arrhythmias can be life-threatening, depending on the type and cause.

If you notice symptoms of a cardiac arrhythmia in your cat, take them to the veterinarian immediately.

Types of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats

There are several alterations to the heart’s pattern that can cause cardiac arrhythmias in cats, including:


	
	Sinus arrhythmia—A rate change with normal signal transmission that is not a concern for a cat’s health. No symptoms are typically shown, and heart function is normal. The heart rate changes to match the cat’s breathing pattern.
	
	
	AV block—Occurs when the signal between the top of the heart and bottom of the heart gets interrupted. It usually sounds like a very slow heart rate (bradycardia). If the signal is only delayed (first-degree block), treatment is not needed. Severe heart block stops the signal entirely and can be life-threatening.
	
	
	Premature beats—In these arrhythmias, the signal to contract starts in an abnormal place. These abnormal rhythms are described based on where the signal starts—either supraventricular premature contractions (SVPC) from the top of the heart or ventricular premature contractions (VPC) from the bottom of the heart.
	


Isolated SVPCs and VPCs are usually not of concern and can occur in normal patients, but if these signals occur quickly, they can lead to fast heart rates called supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia. This doesn’t allow normal function of the heart.

Cats with these arrhythmias may show panting and collapse. If left untreated, these arrhythmias can be fatal.

Symptoms of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Symptoms of arrhythmias can be difficult for pet parents to see, and many cats will have no obvious clinical signs. Unfortunately, in some cases of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, no symptoms are seen until sudden death occurs.

Subtle changes that can be seen are a decreased appetite and your cat sleeping more. These signs may come and go if the arrhythmia is not constant.

You may also want to look out for symptoms of disease that can lead to arrhythmias. Weight loss, increased thirst, or vomiting should prompt an evaluation of your kitty for hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and intestinal disease.

Symptoms of severe cardiac arrhythmias in cats include:


	
	Syncope (fainting)
	
	
	Increased respiratory rate
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	
	
	Abdominal distension
	


If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital immediately.

Causes of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Most arrhythmias in cats are due to underlying structural heart disease. Cats may be born with abnormal heart development (congenital heart disease).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are primarily genetic, progressive diseases that lead to extremely thick (in HCM) or thin (in DCM) heart muscles. Infection and trauma can also make enough change to the heart muscle to cause an arrhythmia.

High blood pressure, low red blood cell count (anemia), alterations in the nervous system,  and certain electrolyte changes in the bloodstream can lead to arrhythmias even when the heart structure stays normal.

Hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, cancer, and certain toxins have all been linked to arrhythmias. If these conditions can be treated, the arrhythmias usually resolve.

Arrhythmias can occur in any cat of any age of any breed, but breeds like Ragdolls, Himalayans, and Siamese are more predisposed to structural heart disease and arrhythmias. A recent study found that abnormal heart rhythms are also more common in male cats and older cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Typically, veterinarians diagnose cardiac arrhythmia in cats with a full physical exam. If your vet hears a heart murmur (abnormal heart sounds), further testing may be needed even if they don’t hear an abnormal rhythm.

To determine which arrhythmia your cat has, an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. This maps out the electric signal that the heart muscle is sending. These electric signals are different for each type of arrhythmia.

In cases where an arrhythmia is intermittent, your vet may recommend a Holter monitor, a small vest that runs an ECG for 24 hours while your cat behaves normally at home. Usually this is enough to catch even the most minor arrhythmia. 

Your vet will recommend blood work to evaluate kidney function, electrolyte levels, and thyroid levels, as these systemic issues may be causing the abnormal rhythm and can be treated directly.

To look for underlying heart disease, your vet may recommend a specific blood test called a proBNP, which detects elevated levels of the proBNP hormone when the heart muscle is stretched abnormally.

Chest X-rays may or may not show heart enlargement in cats with heart disease, but they should be performed to look for fluid buildup or enlarged vessels that may indicate heart failure.

An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) with a veterinary cardiologist will give the best information about the structure and internal function of your cat’s heart. This is the best way to look for heart muscle abnormalities like HCM and DCM and determine how severe the heart disease is.

Treatment of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Treatment of arrhythmias is highly dependent on the underlying cause. While medications to alter heart rhythm and rate exist, they are rarely used in cats because underlying issues are so common. Arrhythmias caused by thyroid disease, kidney disease, or low red blood cell counts will need to have those conditions treated directly.

Arrhythmias due to structural heart disease like HCM or DCM may be managed with medications to improve heart function and slow heart rate. Unfortunately, cardiomyopathies are diseases that are managed, not cured, and heart function may worsen over time despite treatment.

Pacemakers may be placed for rare cases where the arrhythmia is only due to electrical misfiring, such as AV block. These implants directly control the electrical signal to a cat’s heart muscle. Pacemakers are not used in cats who already have structural changes and remodeling of the heart muscle.

Recovery and Management of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Recovery of cardiac arrhythmia in cats also depends on the underlying cause. Mild heart disease or systemic diseases like hyperthyroidism can usually be managed on an outpatient basis with oral medications. Severe kidney failure and heart failure may require hospitalization and intensive care.

Whether inpatient or outpatient, most arrhythmias require frequent monitoring with your veterinarian to avoid progression.

The goal with arrythmia management is for cats to live a normal life at home. Due to the increased risk of fainting, cats with arrhythmias should remain indoor-only and may benefit from having food and litter on the same level of your home so they don’t have to navigate stairs.

Prevention of Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats
Unfortunately, there’s not much the pet parent can do to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in cats. But annual exams and routine blood work can help find arrhythmias and their causes before the disease becomes severe.

One form of dilated cardiomyopathy has been linked to low taurine levels in a cat’s diet. The majority of well-balanced commercial cat foods now have taurine added to avoid this issue.
Cardiac Arrhythmia in Cats FAQsWhat do I do if my cat’s heart is beating fast?If you notice an elevated heart rate in your cat, it’s important to look for other symptoms.

If your cat is breathing normally, eating well, and playful, it’s reasonable to call your vet for a non-emergency visit to discuss the high heart rate.

If your cat is visibly in pain, breathing very fast or panting, has recently collapsed, or is not eating their meals, an emergency vet visit is needed. There are no treatments to be performed at home in these situations.

584,Cardiac Arrest in Cats,"Cardiopulmonary Arrest in Cats

Also known as circulatory arrest or cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrest  is the cessation of normal blood circulation ceases due to the heart's inability to contract (heart failure). Like many other body systems, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems work in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, if a cat fails to breathe for more than six minutes, it can lead to heart failure and cardiac arrest -- both of which can be fatal. Cardiac arrest can occur in cats of any age, sex, or breed.

Symptoms and Types

Blood circulation may remain intact if the animal resumes breathing within four minutes of the initial problem. However, if it lasts longer than six minutes it can lead to cardiac arrest. Common symptoms associated with this emergency include:


    Dilated pupils
    Spontaneous loss of consciousness (syncope)
    Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
    Heavy breathing (dyspnea) and gasping
    Hypothermia
    Lack of response to stimulation


Causes


    Abnormally low levels of oxygen in arterial blood (hypoxemia)
    Low oxygen supply; possible due to anemia
    Heart disease (e.g., infections, inflammation, trauma, neoplasia of heart)
    Metabolic diseases
    Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia)
    Abnormally low bodily fluid levels
    Shock
    Use of anesthetic drugs
    Blood poisoning caused by bacterial toxic substances in the blood (toxemia)
    Brain trauma
    Electrical shock


Diagnosis

Cardiac arrest is an emergency that will require immediate veterinary assistance to assess the animal's condition and the form of treatment. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated the complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, focusing on the cat's airways, breathing ability, and circulation. Your veterinarian will also constantly monitor your cat's blood pressure and pulse rate.

Routine diagnostic exams used to determine the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest include chest X-rays, complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Blood samples are collected to determine the level of gases, including oxygen, in the blood. Cats suspected of having an underlying heart disease may undergo echocardiography to evaluate the extent of the problem.



Treatment

This is a life-threatening emergency that will require immediate hospitalization and intensive nursing support and treatment. The primary goal is to restart the cat's heart rhythm and respiration rate, which may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Once the trachea is cleared and CPR is performed, a tube may be passed into the trachea to facilitate breathing. Oxygen may also be supplied to normalize the blood oxygen levels.

Cats with heart failure may require external cardiac massage to stimulate heart to beat normally. Those unresponsive to cardiac massage may receive rapid chest compressions. Typically medications are administered to assist in normalizing cardiac functions. Otherwise, the chest is incised to provide the open chest resuscitation to the animal or medications are administered directly into the heart -- both of which are considered a last resort.

Living and Management

The overall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest and the course of treatment. Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of cats recover, even after successful emergency treatment.

If your cat's condition does stabilize, it will need to stay in the hospital for a few days. There, the veterinarian may monitor cardiac functions and blood pressure and treat any further complications."," and Types

"
585,Carcinoid Cancer in Cats,"Carcinoid Syndrome and Tumor in Cats

Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow growing tumors that are formed by the endocrine cells in the mucosal lining of organs, such as the stomach and intestine. These tumors are small neuroendocrine tumors, typically of the gastrointestinal tract, that secrete serotonin, a naturally occurring neurochemical that is usually associated with sleep and memory functions.

Carcinoid tumors secrete the amines serotonin and histamine into the bloodstream, as well as a number of peptides - chemical compounds such as bradykinins and tachykinins, which are responsible for tissue contraction. Carcinoid tumors are rare in animals, but when they do occur it is generally after a cat has reached seven years of age.

Symptoms and Types

Primary carcinoid tumors are usually found in the stomach, small intestine, liver, and heart. The general clinical symptoms of carcinoid tumors include anorexia, vomiting, dyschezia, weight loss due to liver failure, and heart disease.

Causes

As with many types of cancers, the actual causes and risk factors for carcinoid tumors are unknown. Clinical signs in cats can vary greatly, depending on the location of the tumor and how far the metastasis has advanced. The size of the tumor and how it may be impeding the functionality of the organ it resides in will also have a lot of influence on how ill your pet feels, and whether or not it will be fatal.

Diagnosis

There are a variety of ways to diagnose carcinoid tumors. An intestinal tumor may cause some of the same symptoms as primary gastrointestinal diseases, such as neoplasias, dietary indiscretions, parasites, and inflammation related to any other condition. Therefore, a differential diagnosis will be necessary — meaning that your doctor will base the findings on a process of elimination, using both the symptoms and the results of tests. Biochemical tests and urine analysis may yield normal results, with the exception of a mild non-regenerative anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and elevated liver enzymes. An ultrasound image may lead to the identification of primary tumors and metastasis in the abdomen and thorax. However, a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a biopsy of the affected tissues. An electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical stains can help to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the substances that are typically secreted by carcinoid tumors.
 


Treatment

Sometimes, complete surgical removal of the tumor can cure the condition. Reducing the size of the tumor through surgery may also help to eliminate any gastrointestinal symptoms that are being caused by the obstruction of a large tumor. There are no other standard therapies for treating carcinoid tumors, but your veterinarian may have some treatment options available that will help to keep metastasis to a minimum, or to help make your pet comfortable.

Living and Management

If a tumor can not be completely removed, routine blood tests will need to be conducted to determine whether destructive hepatic metastasis is occurring. A yearly ultrasound is also recommended for monitoring progress, so that if any metastasis has occurred in the liver, or in other organs, it can be treated promptly, before organ functionality is reduced."," and Types

"
586,Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in Cats,"Carbon Monoxide Toxicosis in Cats



Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, nonirritating gas produced by the inefficient combustion of carbon fuels. It is potentially toxic for cats as well as humans. Unventilated kerosene or propane heaters, gasoline engines, automobile exhaust, or fumes from carbon-based fuel heating systems are all potential sources for carbon monoxide toxicity.



When inhaled, this gas is readily absorbed into the blood, combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to the body, and thereby leading to decreased utilization of oxygen in the brain and heart. Most cases of carbon monoxide toxicity in pets occur as a result of human error, such as when a cat has been left in an enclosed area where carbon monoxide is being released. For example, a cat left in an enclosed garage with a running automobile can be exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide in about ten minutes. Cats are also exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide when they are trapped in a building that is on fire. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide will lead to hypoxemia and eventually death.



Symptoms and Types



Depending upon the concentration and duration of exposure of carbon monoxide, the symptoms may be acute or chronic in nature.




	Sleepiness
	Cherry red skin and mucous membranes (e.g., nostrils, lips, ears, genitals), but this is usually not visible in most animals
	Weakness
	Lethargy
	Dizziness
	Seizures
	Uncoordinated movements
	Difficulty in breathing
	Abortion in pregnant animals, especially those in late gestation period
	Depression
	Loss of hearing
	Coma
	Death




Symptoms with chronic exposure to carbon monoxide include:




	Nausea
	Abnormally high levels of acids in blood (acidosis)
	Vomiting
	Cough
	Flu like symptoms
	Loss of exercise stamina
	Disturbances in gait




Causes



Exposure to any source of carbon monoxide, like:




	Incomplete combustion of carbon fuels
	Accidentally leaving cat in a closed garage with automobile engine turned on
	Poorly ventilated areas with any source of carbon monoxide (e.g., fireplace, oven, barbecue grill)
	Unventilated furnaces
	Gas water heaters
	Gas or kerosene heaters
	House fires




Diagnosis



The foremost step in carbon monoxide toxicity is to get your cat away from the source of the carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide toxicity is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate veterinary intervention. Your veterinarian will start immediate oxygen therapy to remove the carbon monoxide from the blood and bring your cat's oxygen levels back to normal. While your cat is receiving oxygen your veterinarian will collect samples of blood for diagnostic testing. A complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and other applicable body fluid tests will be performed. Your veterinarian will also collect samples for determination of carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood. Establishing the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood is the most useful test for basing the initial treatment plan.



Carboxyhemoglobin levels rise in acute cases and drop within a few hours once exposure to the source of the carbon monoxide has been removed. Levels of acids in the blood will also be determined during blood testing, as acid concentrations tend to rise in response to this condition and their values will determine the appropriate diagnosis and medical response. Other diagnostic tools your veterinarian may use include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether the heart has also been affected.







Treatment



If you suspect that your cat has been subjected to excessive amounts of carbon monoxide, immediately call for veterinary help. In the meantime, remove your cat from the source of the toxic gas to a location where it can breathe fresh air. Your veterinarian will start emergency treatment to restore adequate levels of oxygen to the vital organs. Supplementation of 100 percent pure oxygen is the best method for initiating a quick recovery. Fluids will also be given to improve blood perfusion to vital organs like the brain, as well as to normalize the increased concentrations of acids in blood.

 

Living and Management



While your cat is recovering from the carbon monoxide poisoning, limit its activity for at least six weeks. Encourage the cat to relax as much as possible and make a place where it can go to be alone, while still being available, as some cats need extra attention during a time of stress such as this. Watch your cat for any recurrence of symptoms and call for help if you suspect any untoward symptom in your cat. Nervous symptoms may be seen in some animal patients weeks after the initial recovery. If you do become aware of any nervous system abnormalities, call your veterinarian for advisement.



Carbon monoxide is as lethal to you as to your cats, therefore, use carbon monoxide detectors at home to prevent possible or re-occurring episodes. The human element is the most important line of prevention. Protect your cats from any sources of carbon monoxide."," and Types

587,Capillariasis in Cats,"Infection with Capillaria plica in Cats

One type of worms in cats is caused by the parasitic worm known as Capillaria – the condition is capillariasis. The worm infects the urinary bladder and sometimes other parts of the urinary tract.

Symptoms and Types

Often, there are no symptoms and diagnosis of the cat worm is incidental. However, especially in cats with a heavy infection, symptoms include:


    Frequent      urination
    Painful      urination
    Bloody      urine
    Straining      to urinate


Infected cats are usually over 8 months of age.

Causes

Capillaria plica and Capillaria feliscati are the parasitic worms that can cause capillariasis in cats. The lifecycle of the worm is not completely understood. However, we know that ova (worm eggs) pass out through the urine of infected cats. These ova embryonate and then may be ingested from the soil by earthworms. The Capillaria worm then continues to develop inside the earthworm to an infective stage. When another cat then ingests the earthworm, infection can occur.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of this cat worm is through identification of Capillaria ova in the urine of the infected cat. The ova are characteristic in appearance: football-shaped with plugs at both ends of the ova.



Treatment

Treatment is often not recommended if the cat is not ill. However, if symptoms of worm infection are present, fenbendazole or ivermectin can be used to treat the infection.

Prevention

Keeping cats indoors, where there is no access to earthworms, should prevent capillariasis."," and Types

588,Cancerous Lymphoid Cells in the Lungs of Cats,"Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis in Cats
 
When cancerous lymphoid cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) infiltrate lung tissue, it is known as Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis, a rare disease that affects cats. Metastasis may occue in other body sites and organs like the liver,  heart, spleen, pancreas, and kidney.
 
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is not breed- or gender-specific, but is more common in large and purebred cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Respiratory symptoms are often seen which aggravate over time. The following are a few of the more common symptoms related to this disease:
 

    Cough
    Difficulty breathing
    Inability to exercise
    Weight loss (cachexia)
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Fever (in some animals)

 
Causes
 
The underlying cause for lymphomatoid granulomatosis is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are usually non-specific and inconsistent with the disease.
 
Blood testing, meanwhile, may reveal an abnormally high number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (all types of white blood cells) in the blood. And X-rays will reveal details related to lung tissue and abnormalities. The attending veterinarian may also take a small lung tissue sample (biopsy) to be sent to veterinary pathologist for a definitive diagnosis.


 


Treatment
 
Unfortunately, there is no cure available. However, chemotherapy is often combined with surgical excision of the affected tissue. Regular blood testing, and cardiac and other body system evaluation are necessary during treatment.
 
Living and Management
 
Because there is no cure available, you should talk to a veterinary oncologist for their best recommendations. Chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic to different body systems, and various complications are seen during and after treatment. Call your veterinarian immediately if you observe any untoward symptoms in your cat such as difficulty breathing, depression, or lack of appetite. In case of serious complications, your veterinarian may reduce dosages or stop the treatment altogether. In addition, chemotherapy medication is potentially hazardous to human health and should always be administered with the consent of a veterinary oncologist and kept in a secure place."," and Types

Uterine tumors are rare occurrences, usually affecting middle-aged to older female cats that have not been spayed. These tumors arise from the uterine smooth muscle and epithelial tissues -- the tissues that line the internal organs and cavities. Cats usually develop malignant metastatic (aggressive and spreading) uterine tumors called adenocarcinomas, tumors that are derived from the glands. These types of tumors are called Müllerian tumors, since the uterus is derived from the Müllerian ducts in the embryo.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Vaginal discharge
    Abnormal estrous cycles
    Frequent urination
    Frequent drinking
    Vomiting
    Abdominal distention, swelling
    Infertility, inability to breed successfully
    Uterine prolapse (displacement of the uterus outside the body)

 
Causes
 
This cancer tends to take place in female cats that have not been spayed.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. 
 
X-rays will be taken of the chest to check for cancer spread. X-rays of the abdomen should also be taken to detect a possible abdominal mass. An ultrasound provides even greater visual sensitivity, and may be used to reveal a uterine mass during an abdominal examination. A computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can further detail a mass and enable the most sensitive detection of the cancerfs spread in the body.
 
If there is abdominal fluid buildup, a fluid sample should be tapped and sent to the laboratory for analysis. A cellular examination of a biopsy taken from the tumor is required for a definitive diagnosis.
 
Treatment
 
The ideal treatment is to spay the cat. However, doxorubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin, and epirubicin are the most rational chemotherapeutic choices for treating cancerous uterine tumors and their spread of disease.
 
Living and Management
 
If the uterine tumor is malignant, your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments every three months to check for cancer spread and adjust the therapy as needed.  Before each chemotherapy treatment, complete bloodwork will be done. If the uterine tumor is benign, surgery (spaying) is generally curative."," and Types

590,Cancer of the Blood Vessel Cells in Cats,"Hemangiopericytoma in Cats

Where hemangio refers to the blood vessels, and a pericyte is a type of connective tissue cell, a hemangiopericytoma is metastatic vascular tumor arising from the pericyte cells.

A pericyte might best be described as a non-specialized cell. It is one of the original embryonic cells, but instead of taking on a specific function, it remains in its first stage, waiting until it is needed. The function of the pericyte is to differentiate into whatever type of cell the body requires to function, regenerating new tissue as needed. In this case, the pericyte is damaged by improper cell division, and instead of forming tissue that is useful to the body, it forms a tumor. This affects the cells surrounding very small blood vessels, called capillaries, in the subcutaneous tissue.

Although a hemangiopericytoma does not usually spread throughout the body, it does grow continuously at the the site of origin. Over the course of several months to possibly years, this deeply rooted  tumor grows until it has taken up the space in which it resides, affected the nearby organs and eventually impairing their function. This can be especially fatal when it occurs in the chest, close to the heart and lungs. Fortunately, this tumor has a high rate of successful treatment, but it must be treated before it has grown to unmanageable proportions. This is a relatively rare tumor in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Slow growing mass may be seen over 	weeks or months, usually on a limb
    Rapid growth in case of high grade 	variant tumor
    Soft, fluctuant or firm mass, 	usually on a limb, but in some cases on the trunk of the animal
    Small, but slowly growing bump or 	nodule on the body – may appear as an ulcer or sore, a bald spot, 	or as a differently pigmented (colored) area


Causes

The exact cause is still unknown, may be genetically predisposed.

Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. After the initial background information has been noted, your veterinarian will perform complete physical examination, which will include routine laboratory tests: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually within normal ranges. A more definitive diagnosis will be based on the results of a biopsy analysis. Your veterinarian will take tissue a sample from the growing mass and examine it microscopically to confirm the diagnosis and determine the grade of the tumor. Your veterinarian may also take X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the extent of the local metastasis and how deeply rooted the tumor is. These studies will be key in planning the surgery and ongoing therapy for your cat.

  

Treatment

Early and aggressive surgical excision of the affected tissue, along with some of the surrounding normal tissue remains the treatment of choice. A skilled veterinary surgeon will be called on to excise the affected area in order to enhance the chances of a complete removal of tumor. The removed tissue will be submitted to a veterinary pathologist for evaluation. Radiation therapy is generally highly successful with this type of tumor. You and your veterinarian will work together to decide if surgery along with radiation therapy is the best course of treatment for your cat.

In many cases, recurrence is expected, as this type of cellular tumor has a high incidence of recrudescence. Your veterinarian will monitor the area in follow up visits, and if the hemangiopericytoma should recur, you doctor will explain the options to you so that you can make the treatment decision that is most appropriate for your cat.

In some patients amputation of the affected limb is an option, as this will remove the entire affected area. Because this type of tumor usually remains local and does not spread out in the body, this can be a very effective method for resolving the issue. Another method is to remove the growth again. This method, along with radiotherapy, may be effective, especially for those patients in which complete removal of mass is not possible. The drawback is that if the tumor should return yet again, it will be more deeply rooted in the tissue, as each recurrence becomes more invasive than the last. The last method is to take no action at all. This may be the appropriate response, especially if your cat is older. The tumor grows at a slow rate and does not affect the animal's health until it has grown to a size where it is affecting the organs and/or limbs. Conversely, this may not be the appropriate response if your cat is young.

Living and Management

The overall survival time largely depends upon the nature of the tumor and the aggressiveness with which surgery and treatment are conducted. A cure is possible in animals that have undergone early and aggressive surgical resection of the tumor. Because recurrence of hemangiopericytoma is common, you will need to take your cat for follow up checkups or radiotherapy treatments. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for progress evaluation visits.

Your veterinarian will prescribe post-surgery pain killers for your cat to help make it more comfortable. Use pain medications with caution; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is due to overdose of medication. Cage rest is recommended after surgery. A quiet area set aside, away from household traffic, active children and other pets will help your cat to recover. Also, setting the litter box and food dishes close by to where your cat is convalescing will allow your cat to remain capable. Keep in mind that you should not leave the cat alone for extended periods of time. Affection is a great help for recovery, and you will need to make sure that the cat is not laying in the same position for long. In case of limb amputation, most cats recover well, learning to compensate for the lost limb."," and Types

591,Cancer in Cats,"What Is Cancer in Cats?
A cat’s body is made up of millions of tiny cells that provide them with energy, contain DNA, and perform numerous functions, such as fighting infections.

Under normal circumstances, cells grow, divide, and die and are then replaced with new cells that repeat this cycle. Sometimes, cells become damaged but continue to grow and divide. This abnormal cell growth can lead to tumor development, which may be cancerous.

Approximately 6 million cats in the United States are diagnosed with cancer each year, and 53 to 83% of tumors in cats are cancerous, or malignant. Survival of cancer in cats depends on the cancer type, whether it’s spread, and a cat’s overall health.

Types of Cancer in Cats

Cats can develop several types of cancer, including:


	
	Lymphoma—Lymphoma is the most common type of cancer in cats. This cancer affects white blood cells called lymphocytes which make up lymphoid tissue that is found throughout the body.  The GI tract, kidneys, and lymph nodes are commonly affected in cats.
	
	
	Mastocytoma—Mastocytomas, or mast cell tumors, develop from mast cells, which are made in the bone marrow and circulate throughout the body. Mastocytomas most often develop in the skin or spleen in cats.
	
	
	Leiomyosarcoma—Leiomyosarcoma is a rare but painful type of soft tissue cancer in cats that affects muscles in the stomach and intestines.
	
	
	Fibrosarcoma—Fibrosarcoma affects soft tissues such as muscle and connective tissue. It spreads slowly but can be locally aggressive.
	
	
	Mammary tumors—Mammary tumors affect the tissue surrounding a cat’s teat. They are aggressive tumors that generally spread to nearby lymph nodes and the lungs.
	
	
	Osteosarcoma—Osteosarcoma is bone cancer that affects the skeleton of cats. It is locally aggressive and painful.
	
	
	Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma—Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma develops in a cat’s sweat glands and often occurs in the ear canal.
	
	
	Melanoma—Melanomas are often isolated, raised masses that may bleed. They can affect many parts of the body, including the mouth, skin, and eyes.
	
	
	Myeloproliferative neoplasm—Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a type of blood cancer that originates from the bone marrow.
	
	
	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—SCC is the most common skin tumor in cats and grows quickly.
	
	
	Hemangiosarcoma—Hemangiosarcoma is a fast-growing tumor that develops from blood vessel cells and may cause internal bleeding.
	
	
	Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)—TCC is a tumor that grows in the bladder of cats. It is locally aggressive.
	


Symptoms of Cancer in Cats
Cancer in cats can cause several symptoms, which typically depend on the type of cancer. Symptoms may include:


	
	Visible lumps and bumps
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Weight gain or loss
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Difficulty eating
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Trouble breathing
	
	
	Difficulty passing urine or feces
	
	
	Bad breath
	
	
	Sores
	
	
	Bloating
	
	
	Blood in the feces
	
	
	Blood-tinged urine
	


Causes of Cancer in Cats
Many factors have been linked to cancer in cats, including:


	
	Toxins found in cigarette smoke and asbestos
	
	
	UV light
	
	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV)
	
	
	Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
	
	
	Injections and vaccinations
	
	
	Healed fractures, device implantation, preexisting bone disease, and previous irradiation
	
	
	Age at time of spaying
	
	
	Breed, such as Siamese and Persian cats
	



	
	Age (varies according to type of cancer)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Cancer in Cats 
Your veterinarian will start by reviewing your cat’s entire medical history. It can be helpful to track symptoms you observe prior to the appointment and take pictures of masses that are visible.

Next, your vet will perform a thorough exam and will likely test your cat’s blood and urine. They may also perform or recommend imaging tests, such as:


	
	X-rays—These may be taken to view your cat’s chest, abdomen, or limbs.
	
	
	Ultrasound—This provides real-time images of your cat’s internal organs.
	
	
	Endoscopy—This involves inserting a small camera into your cat’s mouth or rectum to view the stomach or intestines
	
	
	Computed tomography (CT)—CT uses a computer to make cross-sectional images of parts of a cat’s body with high resolution and contrast.
	
	
	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An MRI scan provides detailed images of your cat’s body without using radiation.
	


Imaging allows your veterinarian to see a tumor but does not diagnose the type of cancer your cat has.

Your vet may also collect a sample from the tumor to examine the cells inside it. A fine needle aspirate (FNA) involves inserting a needle into the tumor and using a syringe to suction cells that will be viewed under a microscope.

A biopsy involves surgically removing part of the tumor and viewing the cells under a microscope. Biopsies typically provide a more accurate diagnosis and can help your veterinarian predict how a tumor may act.

Cats that are not healthy enough for sedation or anesthesia may not be able to undergo more advanced tests, such as CT or MRI imaging, or a biopsy.

Treatment of Cancer in Cats 
Whether or not your cat’s cancer is curable depends on many factors, including:


	
	Cancer type
	
	
	Pre-existing health conditions
	
	
	Cancer stage
	
	
	Tumor location and size
	


Your cat’s veterinary team will help determine the best treatment plan, which may involve:


	
	Surgery—Surgery is commonly performed to remove tumors located near the surface of the skin or that are localized to one area.
	
	
	Chemotherapy— Chemotherapy is given by injection or orally to kill cancer cells. It is often used for cancers that have already spread.
	
	
	Radiation—Radiation therapy uses targeted beams of radiation to kill cancer cells. It may be suggested for tumors that cannot be surgically removed.
	
	
	Immunotherapy—Immunotherapy uses your cat’s immune system to fight cancer, but it is relatively new in cats.
	



	
	Photodynamic therapy—Photodynamic therapy combines light and light-sensitive substances to destroy cancerous tissue.
	


A combination of treatments is often suggested for cats with cancer. For example, surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy, can help ensure all cancerous cells have been removed or destroyed.

Some cats may not be healthy enough to withstand treatment, in which case palliative care may be used to keep them comfortable. Your cat’s veterinarian may prescribe pain and anti-inflammatory medications, a special diet, fluid therapy, and blood transfusions.

 Recovery and Management of Cancer in Cats
Each cat’s post-treatment recovery and timeline varies. Your veterinarian will provide instructions and expectations for your cat’s individual needs.

There are several ways you can support your cat’s recovery.


	
	Keep them in a quiet enclosed space with fresh water, food, a bed, and litterbox nearby.
	
	
	Closely monitor your cat.
	
	
	Assist with your cat’s needs, such as grooming or eating.
	
	
	Follow guidelines given by your cat’s veterinarian.
	
	
	Prioritize follow-up appointments.
	


Many cats who are not candidates for treatment can still have a good quality of life. However, if a cat’s quality of life begins to decline, humane euthanasia may be recommended by the veterinarian. Your veterinarian can walk you through this option to ensure you and your cat are comfortable during the process.

Your veterinarian will help you decide what your cat may need during recovery. Below is a list of possible items:


	
	Oral syringes
	
	
	Waterproof blanket
	
	
	Pill pocket treats
	
	
	Cat bed
	
	
	Soft recovery cone
	
	
	Pet bathing wipes

Prevention of Cancer in Cats
Although many types of cancer can’t be prevented, there are some steps you can take to reduce your cat’s overall risk.


	
	Reduce your cat’s likelihood of contact with FeLV by keeping them indoors and keeping their vaccinations up to date.
	



	
	Reduce your cat’s exposure to indoor toxins, such as asbestos and tobacco smoke.
	
	
	Minimize your cat’s exposure to UV light.
	
	
	Prioritize annual vet appointments for young adults and biannual appointments for cats older than 8 years.

592,Can Cats Have Separation Anxiety?,"Separation anxiety is a condition commonly known in dogs, but what about cats?

Our feline companions have a reputation for being aloof, independent, or even antisocial. Those who share their homes with cats often disagree, but now there is research to back up their claims that cats are not so aloof.

A recent study showed that cats living with humans have similar attachment styles to pet parents as dogs and children do.

In fact, 64% of the cats evaluated were described as securely attached to their humans. These cats showed less stress when near their caregivers.

Here’s how to identify cat separation anxiety and what you can do to provide relief.

What Are the Signs of Separation Anxiety in Cats?

Separation anxiety is an unwelcome condition that can be a result of excessive attachment. Research supports the fact that cats can develop separation anxiety syndrome, and they show many of the same signs that are seen in dogs.

A few possible signs that a cat is suffering from separation anxiety include:


	
	Urinating outside the litter box: in one study, three-quarters of the cats that peed outside the litter box did so exclusively on the pet parent’s bed
	
	
	Defecating outside the litter box
	
	
	Excessive vocalization: some cats also carry a favorite toy in their mouths while yowling or crying
	
	
	Destroying things: more common in male cats
	
	
	Excessive grooming: more common in female cats
	
	
	Hyper-attachment to their caregiver: seeking constant contact when they are together
	


What Causes Separation Anxiety in Cats?

Some factors could predispose a cat to developing separation anxiety, while other causes are environmental:


	
	Being a female cat. Female cats are diagnosed with separation anxiety more often than male cats.
	
	
	Living strictly indoors. Most separation anxiety cases are seen in cats that live strictly indoors and come from a home with only one adult caregiver.
	
	
	Not having other pets in the home.
	
	
	Being orphaned, weaned early, or bottle-raised.
	
	
	Experiencing a change in routine often prompts separation anxiety or causes it to get worse. (That can include a change in ownership, moving to a new home, or changes in the caregiver’s schedule. A common scenario is a pet parent that has worked from home and then transitions to leaving the house for work each day.)
	


How Is Separation Anxiety Diagnosed in Cats?

Since the signs of separation anxiety could also indicate other health concerns, diagnosing any emotional disorder always starts with a thorough medical workup to rule out medical issues.

This starts with a physical exam that includes lab work such as blood and urine tests. Your veterinarian will then ask detailed questions about your cat’s behavior.

Providing a video of your cat’s behavior when they are home alone can be very helpful in determining a diagnosis.

What Can You Do to Relieve Separation Anxiety in Cats?

Treatment for all anxiety disorders can be divided into three categories:


	
	Management of the environment to decrease anxiety from occurring
	
	
	Pharmaceuticals
	
	
	Behavior modification
	


Management of the Environment

There are quite a few ways you can modify your cat’s environment to help relieve your cat’s separation anxiety.

Here are some examples of changes you can make to manage the environment.

Provide Enrichment Activities

There are endless options for enrichment activities to keep your cat busy while you are gone. There are TV shows designed specifically for cats and even cameras that allow you to toss treats to your cat and talk to them when you are not home.

You can also try puzzle feeders, which are toys that your cat has to play with to release the food inside. Giving one to your cat before you start getting ready to leave can keep them busy so they aren’t worried about what you are doing.

Working (hunting) for their food is wonderful enrichment for cats.

Ignore Attention-Seeking Behaviors

Try to ignore attention-seeking behaviors whenever possible. Instead, provide attention when your cat is calm and shows signs of independence.

For example, you can praise or toss a small treat to your cat when they are resting in another room or when they stop meowing for attention.

Remain calm when you leave your house and return home. Wait until your cat is calm and quiet to give them attention after you get home.

Giving your cat activities to keep them busy and engaged as you get ready to leave and while you are gone can be very helpful. Some cats also experience a calming effect from pheromone products, such as plug-in diffusers or collars.

Create and Maintain a Consistent Routine

Consistent routines are very beneficial for pets with anxiety disorders. Keeping to the same schedule as much as you can is good for them.

Pharmaceuticals and Nutraceuticals

If management changes alone are not enough, your veterinarian may recommend a supplement or medication to reduce your cat’s anxiety.

Supplements can yield a 25% improvement in signs, while medications should yield at least a 50% improvement.

Some cats benefit most from a short-acting medication that is only given before departures. Others do better on a longer-acting medication that stays in their body all the time.

The goal of medications and supplements is to make adjustments to the cat’s brain chemistry.

Medications can help cats cope with stressful situations more easily and can help them make progress with behavior modification therapies.

The desired effect is the happiest and least-stressed version of your beloved pet. The intention is not for your cat’s personality to change or for them to be a zombie.

If there are side effects, a medication can be stopped and you can try something else. Some cats remain on medications for a short period of time, and others can remain on them safely for years.

Behavior Modification

Behavior modification serves the same purpose as cognitive therapy in human psychology. The aim is for the cat to learn coping skills and to change their emotional response to stressful things.

Relaxation Exercises 

One basic technique you can use is a relaxation exercise. This is where you consistently reward your cat when they show signs of being in a relaxed state, such as lying down, sighing, having a loose and still tail, and closing their eyes.

The exercise is paired with an item like a mat, so that over time, your cat learns to become relaxed when they see that item.

Once relaxation is learned, you can perform parts of your departure routine while your cat is in the relaxed state.

Start with simply moving around the room and then progress to approaching the door. As long as your cat remains calm, you can eventually leave the house for longer periods of time.

Counterconditioning

If your cat shows signs of stress when they see certain cues, like putting on shoes or picking up keys, classical counterconditioning can be used. This changes the emotional response from a negative to a positive one.

For example, you can pick up your keys, toss a treat to your cat, and then puts your keys down.

This only works if your cat’s stress level stays low. If your cat doesn’t look expectantly for a treat after doing this at random times consistently for one week, then a medication may need to be started or adjusted.

Methods to Avoid for Separation Anxiety in Cats

There are many suggestions out there for how to help separation anxiety in cats, but not all of them are accurate. Some of the most common management suggestions you might find are getting an additional cat, punishment, and confinement.

Here’s why you should not use these responses if your cat is suffering from separation anxiety.

Getting an Additional Cat

Unless you get two kittens or littermates together, adding another cat could lead to even more stress and conflict.

There is no guarantee that your cat will like the new cat, or that they will become fast friends. You are also adjusting their environment to accommodate the new cat, which can cause additional stress.

Punishment or Confinement for Anxious Behavior

Punishment makes stress and anxiety worse.

Keep in mind that cats do not behave out of spite. Cats with separation anxiety have an illness, no different than diabetes or kidney disease.

Pets that panic when left alone are frequently more stressed when they are confined.

How to Prevent Separation Anxiety in Cats

There is no surefire way to predict which cats will develop separation anxiety. However, there are steps you can take to help decrease the chance your cat will develop this condition.

Look for Confident Cats, Littermates, or Bonded Pairs

When looking for a cat to join your home, select confident and well-socialized kittens or cats. A pair of kittens, especially littermates, can keep each other company and decrease their dependence on humans. A bonded pair of adult cats is also a good option.

Encourage Independence

Encourage your cat to be independent. They should be used to spending some time away from you as a part of their usual routine. Praise them and give them attention when they choose to spend time across the room or out of sight.

Keep Your Daily Departures Low-Key

From the beginning, keep your departures and returns home very low-key. This helps your cat feel like it’s not a big deal when you leave. Saying a consistent but calm phrase when leaving is helpful for some pets, such as, “Be good; see you soon.”

Try Enrichment Activities

Allowing your cat to explore the outdoors safely provides great enrichment if your cat enjoys it. There are several great options now, including special fencing, “catios,” and walking your cat with a harness and leash.

Talk With Your Veterinarian

It makes sense that the human desire for a devoted companion can also lead to hyper-attachment and separation anxiety. Like any illness, diagnosing and starting treatment early gives your cat the best prognosis.

Speak with your veterinarian if you notice any signs that cause you concern. If needed, there are veterinary behaviorists who focus solely on pet psychiatry to help your beloved family member.

Your veterinarian can help recommend a veterinary behaviorist in your area. You can also check this directory to find a board-certified veterinary behaviorist near you.

	Destroying things: more common in male cats
	
	
	Excessive grooming: more common in female cats
	
	
	Hyper-attachment to their caregiver: seeking constant contact when they are together

593,Can Cats Get a Sunburn?,"With the warm weather and long days upon us, we all want to be outside. Nothing beats spending time in the sun surrounded by our loved ones, including our cats. Cats love the heat, and spending time outdoors with them is a great way to enrich their lives. However, during these hot summer months, it’s critical to protect our feline friends from the harmful effects of the sun.

In this article, you’ll learn how to keep your cat safe and understand the signs and symptoms of too much sun exposure.

Do Cats Get Sunburns?
Yes. It’s possible for cats to get sunburned if they’re out in the sun for too long. As with people, cat sunburns are also caused by UV radiation. These harmful, invisible rays of energy damage their delicate skin cells, which causes inflammation (swelling) and redness.

Cats suffer from sunburn on areas of their bodies that are not covered by fur. Their ears, noses, and bellies are among the areas that are most vulnerable.
Symptoms of Sunburn in Cats
A cat experiencing sunburn may have:


	
	Red, scaly, inflamed, or crusted skin that is hot to the touch.
	
	
	Swollen eyes, stomach, paw pads, nose, and eyes.
	
	
	Pain or discomfort.
	
	
	An urge to lick or scratch the affected part of their body, which may further damage their skin.
	


In severe cases, blisters or sores may develop, which can lead to infection.

If your cat is showing any of these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately. Fortunately, sunburns are rare in cats, However, signs of sunburn often look like other underlying conditions, so it’s important to get your cat checked out if you notice any of those listed above.
Causes of Sunburn in Cats
Cats' skin is different from ours, which puts them at an increased risk of sunburn. The sun’s rays can be damaging to felines because they have a thinner epidermis (outer layer of the skin) and less subcutaneous fat (located just under the skin). A cat's skin is sensitive and susceptible to UV damage when exposed to the sun for long periods. They are also more likely to get heatstroke and sunburn due to their inability to sweat.

Which Cats Are Most Susceptible to Sunburns?

Certain cat breeds are at higher risk of sun damage. Cats with white or light-colored (cream or light gray) fur are more likely to get sunburn, heatstroke, dehydration, or skin cancer. These breeds include Siamese, Himalayan, and Persian. Breeds with the greatest risk of sun damage are those with thin or no fur coats, such as Bambino, Sphynx, Donskoy (Russian Hairless), and Peterbald. However, all cats—regardless of fur length or color—can get sunburn.
Treatment of Sunburn in Cats
There are several things you can do to make your cat comfortable if they get sunburn. Apply a cool compress to the affected area for 5-15 minutes. You can also apply cat-friendly aloe vera gel or a honey-based cream. These remedies can help soothe your cat’s skin and reduce inflammation.

After a few days, your cat’s skin may begin to peel. Speak with your veterinarian about whether you can give your pet pain medication to relieve discomfort. Don’t use harsh chemicals on your cat’s skin. This includes rubbing alcohol, which causes inflammation, and essential oils, which can be toxic to cats.

Though rare, cats suffering from sun damage may need hospitalization for supportive care. This can include fluid therapy, antibiotics, and wound treatment. If you notice visible changes of the skin, your cat is not eating, is lethargic, or is vomiting­–contact your veterinarian immediately.  
Preventing Sunburn in Cats
Cats that remain indoors may also be at risk of sun damage. This can occur when UV rays go through windows, which can damage your cat’s skin. You can protect your pet by providing them with shaded areas and closing the curtains of your home during peak sunlight hours.

If you are taking your cat outdoors, make sure that they have access to fresh water and a comfortable shaded area where they can rest. Keep your companion indoors during the sunniest parts of the day, typically between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This will help prevent them from getting overheated. You may also consider buying or building your cat their own shaded patio, where they can enjoy the fresh air while staying safe from the sun and heat.

Use sunscreen specifically made for cats to protect their skin from the harmful rays of the sun. Don’t use sunscreen meant for people on your pet. Human sunscreen can be toxic to cats. Before your cat goes outside, apply sunscreen to their ears, nose, and any other exposed areas of their body. Make sure you reapply when necessary.

Using these tips to heal and protect your cat from the sun will create a happy, healthy summer for you and your feline friend. Remember to contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat begins showing signs of too much sun exposure.

594,Calicivirus in Cats,"What Is Calicivirus in Cats?
Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a viral pathogen that causes upper respiratory tract infection in cats. Infection most commonly resembles a cold, but severe infections involving the lungs, joints, and/or other organs can occur. 

The virus is most commonly found in facilities that house multiple cats, such as rescues, shelters, or breeding facilities. Yet it can spread readily in households with only a few cats. Kittens and young adult cats are usually at the highest risk for infection, but a cat of any age can be affected. 

Symptoms of Calicivirus in Cats
Some cats become infected and do not show any clinical signs. If there are signs, they can range from mild to severe, with severe signs resulting in death. The most common signs are: 


	
	Sneezing 
	
	
	Nasal discharge 
	
	
	Ulceration of the surface of the nose (skin broken open) 
	



	
	Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) 
	
	
	Eye discharge  
	


An affected cat may also develop the following: 


	
	Ulcers on the lip, tongue, or elsewhere in the mouth, often accompanied by drooling 
	
	
	Fever 
	



	
	Lethargy  
	
	
	Dehydration 
	
	
	Poor appetite due to severe nasal congestion and/or oral ulcerations 
	


The following signs are associated with more severe cases: 


	
	Pneumonia, with a cough or difficulty breathing 
	



	
	Joint inflammation, which causes limping or swelling in the affected joint(s) 
	
	
	Signs related to blood vessel wall inflammation (vasculitis), which can lead to multi-organ failure and death, including: 

	
		
		Swelling in the face/legs 
		
		
		Skin wounds 
		
		
		Bloody nose 
		
		
		Bloody stool 
		
	
	


Causes of Calicivirus in Cats
FCV is shed in secretions from the nose, mouth, and eyes. A cat can become infected by contact with secretions containing the virus directly from another cat or indirectly via contact with an object (carrier, food/water bowl, surface) that has been contaminated with infective secretions. 

Once inside the body, FCV invades the cells of the nose, throat, mouth, and tonsils. More aggressive strains of FCV can invade the lungs, joints, and kidneys. Signs of illness usually develop 2-6 days after exposure to the virus.  

There are multiple strains of FCV, and sometimes more than one strain may be infecting cats in the same environment. FCV can mutate to a new strain within a cat’s body. There are differences in virulence or disease-causing ability between strains, from mild to severe. 

How Veterinarians Diagnose Calicivirus in Cats

	
	Lab work, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry, will not directly test for FCV but may be helpful in determining if there is concurrent illness. 
	
	
	Chest radiographs may be recommended if a cat presents with a history of cough, but the findings will not be specific for FCV. Pneumonia can be diagnosed with chest X-rays.  
	



	
	Blood tests that measure FCV antibody levels (titers) can be performed, but a positive or elevated titer can happen with both natural exposure and vaccination. It’s impossible to determine the difference using this test alone.  
	
	
	A polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) can be performed using swabs from the nose, the inside of the eyelids, and/or the mouth. PCR testing can also be performed on blood, feces, and urine early in the disease process. 
	


Keep in mind that a large percentage of healthy cats are long-term carriers of FCV. So just because you find FCV on the test does not mean it is necessarily causing the clinical signs. 

Treatment of Calicivirus in Cats
Supportive care is the gold standard of treatment for cats affected with FCV. 


	
	Place your cat in a warm, steamy bathroom for 10-15 minutes twice daily to help reduce nasal congestion. 
	
	
	Nutrition is important because an affected cat with oral ulcerations and nasal congestion may not want to eat. Offer a variety of very strong-smelling foods. Canned food warmed up slightly may be more enticing than cold canned food or dry food. 
	
	
	Use warm wet cloths to clean away eye and nose discharge. When cats are not feeling well, they do not want to groom, especially if they also have oral ulcers. 
	


Antiviral medication is not commonly used in the treatment of FCV, though some medications may be useful: 


	
	Pain medication is given to cats with oral/nasal ulcerations to provide comfort. 
	
	
	An oral antibiotic can be used to treat secondary infections (nose, lungs, mouth). 
	
	
	Topical eye antibiotic medication will be prescribed for cats with eye infections. 
	
	
	Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be used to reduce inflammation and fever. 
	
	
	Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids may be indicated if a cat is dehydrated. IV fluids can also help in fever reduction. 
	


Recovery and Management of Calicivirus in Cats
Most cats will recover from FCV in 7-10 days. But they can become carriers and shed virus from oral and nasal secretions long term. Cats that become chronic carriers may develop oral inflammation (gingivitis/stomatitis) and be at increased risk for growths in the nose, mouth, or ear (nasopharyngeal or aural polyps). 

Vaccination can help prevent the spread of FCV. A vaccinated cat can still become infected with FCV but not develop any clinical signs or may have mild signs compared to unvaccinated cats. 


	
	Kittens usually get the first dose of vaccine at 9 weeks of age, followed by boosters at 12 weeks and 15-16 weeks. 
	



	
	The vaccine is then boosted at 1 year of age and every 1–3 years after that, depending on the form of vaccine used. 
	
	
	FCV will commonly be given in a combination vaccine called the feline distemper vaccine. 
	


FCV is highly contagious, so it is important to isolate the affected cat, either in a bathroom or bedroom, to avoid exposure. Remember that you can spread the virus to unaffected cats after contact with your infected cat if you do not wash your hands or change your clothes after interaction. 

All materials that have come in contact with the infected cat need to be thoroughly washed. The virus can live in the environment on surfaces for 1-4 weeks and is not killed by regular cleaners. Bleach solution at 1 part bleach to 32 parts water can be used to wipe down surfaces and clean materials like bedding, litter boxes, and food and water bowls.
Calicivirus in Cats FAQsIs calicivirus contagious to humans?No, FCV is not infective to humans. 
Is calicivirus contagious to other pets in the household? It is only contagious to other cats. 
How long do cats live with calicivirus? Some cats can become lifelong carriers of FCV.

595,Calcium Deposits in the Urinary Tract in Cats,"Urolithiasis, Calcium Oxalate in Cats

Urolithiasis is described as the presence of stones in the urinary tract. When these stones are made of calcium oxalate, they are referred to as calcium deposits. In most cases the stones can be removed safely, giving the cat a positive prognosis.

The development of these stones is more common in dogs than in cats, and occurs more frequently in older animals. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

Symptoms and Types

Although it is rare in cats, the most common symptom of urolithiasis is straining while the animal is urinating. If there is inflammation in the urinary tract, the cat may have an enlarged belly or the area surrounding the urinary region may be noticeably irritated. If the calcium deposits are large, they can sometimes be felt through the skin by a veterinarian.

Causes

The primary cause for the formation of stones is high levels of calcium in the urine. Some risk factors can include excessive dietary protein or vitamin D, a vitamin B6 deficiency, the use of calcium supplements or steroids, and a diet comprised exclusively of dry food.

The most common breeds to develop the medical condition include the Himalayan, the Scottish Fold, the Persian, the Ragdoll, and the Burmese.

Diagnosis

X-rays and ultrasounds are performed to rule out any other underlying medical conditions which may be causing the cat's pain or trouble urinating. Blood work will be done to examine the cat's nutrient levels and determine if any are outside of the normal range.

Treatment

One of the most common treatment options is the surgical removal of the stones; in some cases shock waves can be used to help break up the stones. Also, depending on the size and severity of the stones, they can occasionally be flushed and massaged out of the cat's system with a catheter and fluids.

Living and Management

It is important to reduce the cat's activity levels following surgery. Possible complications from the formation of these stones may arise such as the blockage of the urinary tract and the cat's inability to urinate. It is common for animals to reform these calcium-based stones over time. Treatment on an ongoing basis will include the monitoring of calcium intake and the urinary patterns of the cat to observe if any problems develop.

If surgery was used to remove the stones, post-surgical X-rays are recommended to ensure that the stones were completely removed.

Prevention

The best prevention of recurrence is to monitor the cat's calcium levels on an ongoing basis so that adjustments can be made in the diet to maintain normal calcium levels."," and Types

596,Calcium Buildup in Lungs of Cats,"Pulmonary Mineralizations in Cats

When a cat's lungs begin to calcify (a buildup of the mineral calcium in the soft tissue) or ossify (connective tissues, such as cartilage, are turned to bone or bone-like tissue) it is referred to as pulmonary mineralization.

This condition generally affects older cats and it may be generalized or localized. But if the mineralization is discrete, meaning that it is in only one place, individual mineral deposits can be identified. If mineralization is diffuse, however, it will spread out to more than one location, making it impossible to identify the individual deposits.

Pulmonary mineralization can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Cats with pulmonary mineralization may display no symptoms at all. However, some signs or symptoms that may be observed include:


    Cyanosis
    Coughing
    Shortness of breath
    High respiratory rate
    Abnormal breathing sounds
    Exercise intolerance


Calcification can be dystrophic (degenerative), which occurs secondary to tissue degeneration or inflammation, or it can be metastatic (transmissible throughout the body), which occurs secondary to metabolic disease, affecting the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy.

Calcification may also be considered a normal part of the aging process, or with particular breeds (e.g., premature calcification of the tracheal and bronchial cartilages in chondrodystrophic [dwarf] breeds). Calcification is often associated with a wound, thus most focal calcifications are functionally unimportant.

Ossification, also called heterotopic bone formation (the abnormal formation of true bone within extraskeletal soft tissues), can take different forms: calcification of a bony matrix (formative tissue), and pulmonary ossification in the form of small, multiple nodules.

Generalized pulmonary mineralizations of unknown cause are reported in cats under these descriptive terms: pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis or pumice stone lung; bronchiolar microlithiasis; idiopathic pulmonary calcification; or idiopathic pulmonary ossification.

Causes

The underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis is usually unknown (idiopathic). However, it may be also due to:


    Metastatic calcification -- 	secondary to metabolic disease that induces high calcium 	concentration and/or bone resorption (dissolution)
    Hyperadrenocorticism (excessive 	cortisol secretion by the adrenal glands), which may cause 	dystrophic mineralization
    Alveolar and bronchial stones -- 	may be secondary to exudative lung disease (where fluid 	filters from the circulatory system into lesions or areas of 	inflammation), or granulomatous lung disease (a rare 	inherited primary immune deficiency disorder which causes 	inflammatory tissue growth of granulation tissue -- tissue that is 	formed in response to a wound)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination on the cat, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian will conduct a lung biopsy to retrieve samples of tissue from your cat’s lungs in order to determine whether mineralization is occurring. Testing for the presence of bacteria and fungus will also be done.



Other diagnostic tools include chest X-rays and a computed tomography (CT) scan, so that your veterinarian can get a better look at the condition of the lungs and lymph nodes. These tools will also help confirm or exclude the presence of a tumor or fungal infection.

Treatment

There are some medications that can relieve breathing problems, or antibiotics and antifungal medications, if your veterinarian determines that there is a concurrent infection. However, there is no treatment indicated if a localized form is found in a cat with no symptoms.

If there is an underlying metabolic disease, your doctor will prescribe medications for the treatment of that as well. Otherwise, all that is required is a calm and quite space for your cat to recover.

Living and Management

As with any disease of the respiratory system, this is a serious condition. You and your veterinarian will need to carefully monitor your cat’s progress."," and Types

597,Bulging Eyes in Cats,"What Is Bulging Eyes in Cats?
The orbit is the eye socket where the eyeball, or globe, and associated tissues (glands, nerves, vessels, and those muscles responsible for eye movement) are housed.

The orbit is considered a fixed space. That means anything that would increase its volume or affect the eyeball would cause displacement—often causing the globe to be pushed forward, resulting in a “bulging” eye. This can often be described as one of the following:


	
	Buphthalmos—the globe is in a normal position but is enlarged; this is often attributed to glaucoma. One or both eyes can be affected. 
	
	
	Exophthalmos­—the globe itself is normal-sized but protrudes forward. Usually only one eye is affected.
	
	
	Proptosis—sudden, often traumatic, displacement of the globe, which is displaced outward from the eye socket. As a result, the eyelid gets trapped or stuck behind the globe.
	


Orbital disease is the umbrella term for anything that would affect this area. Cats have more bone surrounding their orbit, so the disease is less common than in dogs and often requires some form of surgical treatment.

If bulging eyes are noted, have your cat examined immediately by a veterinarian. This is considered an emergency, and since there are multiple causes of eye protrusion, treatment would vary based on diagnosis.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Bulging Eyes in Cats
The main symptom of cats with bulging eyes is that the eye itself bulges or protrudes outward from the globe.  Cats can also exhibit other symptoms associated with this condition or as a result, including:


	Third eyelid protrusion
	Blindness
	Dull appearance to the cornea, often associated with dry eye
	Conjunctiva (white of the eye)
	Chemosis, or swelling, of the conjunctiva
	Difficulty closing the eyelids
	Periorbital swelling (i.e., swelling of the associated tissues)
	Discharge from the eye or surrounding skin might be commonly mistaken for a draining wound
	Sneezing and/or drainage from the nose
	Absent ocular reflexes
	Asymmetry to the face and sinuses
	Pain upon opening the mouth, often associated with inflamed gums and tissues in the back of the mouth
	Local lymph node enlargement
	Neurologic deficits
	Fever
	Decreased or absent appetite
	Lethargy, lack of energy


Severe symptoms may include:


	Hyphema, commonly seen as a “red eye” where the eye is filled with blood
	Pain especially when touched
	Normal to dilated pupil
	Surrounding abrasions and/or fractures with or without hemorrhage
	Other signs associated with head trauma such as coma, seizures
	Epistaxis (nosebleed)


Causes of Bulging Eyes in Cats
Bulging eyes in cats can be due to various underlying conditions including: 


	
	Abscess formation, caused by bacterial infection, fungal infection, or foreign bodies
	
	
	Inflammation or autoimmune disease
	
	
	Vehicular trauma or trauma experienced from falling, fighting, dog attacks, or abuse (it’s important to note that given a cat’s anatomy, severe trauma is often required to cause proptosis)
	
	
	Disease
	
	
	Dental disease; tooth root abscess
	
	
	Cancer
	
	
	Swelling of salivary glands
	


Bulging eyes can occur in any cats of any breeds, however, younger, unneutered male cats may have a higher incidence of trauma-related proptosis due to territorial and mating behavior.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Bulging Eyes in Cats
After a complete physical exam, your veterinarian may perform a more in-depth ophthalmic exam followed by orbital palpation to determine if the globe is able to be pushed back in. Ocular tests may be performed, such as a Schirmer Tear Test to measure tear production, a fluorescein eye stain to look for corneal ulcerations and abrasions, or an intraocular pressure (IOP) test to measure pressure within the eye. 

Symptoms can mimic other diseases, so your veterinarian may recommend basic blood work like a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, blood pressure, FeLV/FIV/HWT testing, thyroid evaluation, and urinalysis.  The results from these tests provide a baseline and can also aid surgical and anesthetic planning and rule out other conditions.

Additionally, your veterinarian may examine the oral cavity looking for any signs of dental disease, such as infected teeth, swelling of the gums or tissues, or discharge.

Your vet may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist for specialized procedures such as an ocular ultrasound or CT and MRI to look at structures behind the eye, assist with surgical planning, and to aid in diagnosis. X-rays of the chest coupled with X-rays or ultrasound of the abdomen may be done to look for evidence of tumor spread (metastasis).

Treatment of Bulging Eyes in Cats
Treatment for bulging eyes in cats may be surgical (proptosis, cancer, dental disease, trauma, foreign body) or medical (infectious, inflammatory) depending on the diagnosis. 

For any displaced eye, the sooner it can be put back in the place the better. However, given a cat’s orbital bony structure, if proptosis is the underlying cause, it usually carries a less favorable outcome due to the severity of trauma encountered, and enucleation is often performed. Enucleation is the surgical removal of the eyeball and its associated tissues. Enucleation is often performed in cases where:


	
	The eye has ruptured
	
	
	Three or more eye muscles are ruptured or torn
	
	
	The eye has filled with blood
	
	
	A tumor is diagnosed
	
	
	The pet parent is unable or cannot commit to potential long-term care
	


In some cases, the eye can be salvaged but the prognosis for vision is poor. In these cases, once the cat is stabilized, they are anesthetized and surgical replacement of the globe back into the orbit is performed. A temporary tarsorrhaphy (surgical closure of the eyelids) is performed, and frequent ocular (and oral) medications are then administered to aid swelling, inflammation, pain, and infection. 

Consultation and treatment of cancer with a veterinary oncologist for chemotherapy and radiation therapeutic recommendations may be necessary, depending on the diagnosis.   

Recovery and Management of Bulging Eyes in Cats
After surgery, your cat should be kept in a calm and stress-free environment with time given for a chance to acclimate, especially for those cats who underwent an enucleation. 

Partially blind cats can still have a good quality of life with little inconvenience to their pet parents.  Sutures will most likely be present, which will need to be removed in a few weeks. It’s also normal for there to be some swelling and bruising, which should dissipate after a few days. Your cat will be sent home with medications and an e-collar or recovery cone to prevent their scratching or rubbing at the incision.  

Follow your veterinarian's advice and reach out if there are any concerns or further symptoms noted. Sometimes there is residual bleeding or draining from the surgical site, which will need to be addressed. Your veterinarian may recommend compresses to help with the swelling, along with recommendations for exercise restriction or cage rest.

For cats that underwent a tarsorrhaphy or other procedure, recovery will be dependent on their case. Weekly follow-up visits will ensure proper tension of the temporary sutures, along with monitoring for any signs of recurrence of vision. A complete recovery may take several months and some conditions can take longer to see improvement. Medications will vary and may be given frequently during recovery. Your cat may require a special diet or at least need soft food for the first few weeks without any access to chew toys, especially if they underwent a dental procedure. 

Long-term complications can occur, such as dry eye or corneal ulceration. Follow-up appointments and tests may also be required.

Prevention of Bulging Eyes in Cats

Early diagnosis and treatment are key and often minimize pain and discomfort and provide a better prognosis. Monitor your cat closely for any changes to the eyes, and if so, have them examined right away.  Keeping your cat indoors, away from high-energy dogs and cats, and providing it with routine medical and dental care can lessen the chances of developing eye protrusion.   
Bulging Eyes in Cats FAQsCan a cat live with a bulging eye?Bulging eyes can be painful to cats, and it will most certainly affect their quality of life.  Any swelling or protrusion of your cat’s eye should prompt immediate veterinary attention.
Will a cat’s bulging eye heal on its own?Unfortunately, no. Left untreated, your cat will suffer not only from the physical pain and discomfort of a bulging eye but can also suffer from its consequences such as cancer metastasis, sepsis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), or neurologic disease.
How do you treat a cat’s bulging eye?There are many causes for a bulging eye, so your veterinarian will recommend a series of tests for a proper diagnosis. Effective treatment can include surgery, but some cats may be treated with medications. In some situations with cats that have a poor prognosis of lack of vision, removal of the eye may be recommended.

	Third eyelid protrusion
	Blindness
	Dull appearance to the cornea, often associated with dry eye
	Conjunctiva (white of the eye)
	Chemosis, or swelling, of the conjunctiva
	Difficulty closing the eyelids
	Periorbital swelling (i.e., swelling of the associated tissues)
	Discharge from the eye or surrounding skin might be commonly mistaken for a draining wound
	Sneezing and/or drainage from the nose
	Absent ocular reflexes
	Asymmetry to the face and sinuses
	Pain upon opening the mouth, often associated with inflamed gums and tissues in the back of the mouth
	Local lymph node enlargement
	Neurologic deficits
	Fever
	Decreased or absent appetite
	Lethargy, lack of energy


Severe symptoms may include:


	Hyphema, commonly seen as a “red eye” where the eye is filled with blood
	Pain especially when touched
	Normal to dilated pupil
	Surrounding abrasions and/or fractures with or without hemorrhage
	Other signs associated with head trauma such as coma, seizures
	Epistaxis (nosebleed)

598,Broken Bones in Cats,"What Is a Broken Bone in a Cat?
Bones in cats are structurally similar to those in humans. They provide support for body movement and protect internal structures like organs. Bones also contain marrow, where new red and white blood cells are created. Although cats are usually graceful animals, they don’t always land on their feet and as a result may break a bone.

Breaks or fractures in cats happen mostly after falling, getting stepped on, getting hit by a car, or being attacked by a larger animal.

Fractures of the femur (thighbone) are the most common in cats. Tibia (shinbone) fractures are next, followed by pelvis, jawbone, paw, and tail fractures.

Breaks are generally classified by type of bone, area of bone, severity (how many bone pieces broken), and pattern (angle) of fracture.

Symptoms of Broken Bones in Cats
Cats are strong predators and are good at concealing their pain. This can make it difficult to care for a sick or injured cat. Most cats that have broken bones show at least subtle signs of discomfort. Some of the symptoms to look out for are:


	
	Vocalization: crying, grunting, increased meowing, or growling
	
	
	Change in movement: not walking as much or at all, not putting weight on a specific limb, not flicking their tail, or holding their tail limply
	
	
	Change in behavior: not wanting to jump, stretch, or scratch as they normally do; not grooming themselves, or growling and hissing when petted
	
	
	Decreased appetite: avoiding food may indicate a broken jaw or pain in getting to their food bowl
	
	
	Swelling or bruising
	
	
	Other injuries: cuts, scrapes, or bruises in areas where an injury may have occurred
	


What to Do if Your Cat Breaks a Bone
If you suspect your cat has a broken bone, make sure that you are safe when interacting with them. No matter how gentle your cat normally is, when in pain any cat can bite.

Severe breaks and injuries can cause your cat to go into shock. If your cat collapses, is having convulsions, has pale or blue gums, or is breathing with their mouth open, take them to an emergency veterinarian immediately. Cover any area that is bleeding or where there is visible bone with a clean cloth. Then wrap your cat carefully in a towel or blanket and take them for treatment.

Do not try to set any broken bones yourself. Bones should be disturbed as little as possible until your cat is examined by the vet. Try to keep other pets and children away from your injured cat.

How Veterinarians Treat Broken Bones in Cats
How fractures are treated depends on the location and type of fracture and the bone that was broken. Other factors include your cat’s age, weight, and overall health, how old the injury is, and if other injuries are present.

Veterinarians treat broken bones using the following methods:


	
	Splints/casts are used to stabilize certain fractures where the joints above and below the fracture can be immobilized. Splints and casts require weekly bandage changes by your veterinarian.
	
	
	Surgery may be needed to realign bones. Rods, plates, screws, or wires are used to stabilize the fracture or hold misplaced bones in a stable position. All open fractures, where broken bone is visible through a wound, require surgical repair.
	
	
	Amputation may be considered with very severe fractures. It  may be recommended as the fastest way to get your pet healthy and pain-free. Fortunately, most cats do well with amputation of a limb or tail and return to normal faster than those that had stabilization surgery.
	
	
	Crate/cage rest is needed for some simple fractures, where the bones are still normally aligned. These can be treated by severely restricting movement. This option can have side effects, which your veterinarian can explain to you.
	


If surgery or amputation is needed to treat your cat, you may be referred to a veterinary surgeon.

Recovery and Management of Broken Bones in Cats
Regardless of the type of repair or treatment, your cat will need rest following a fracture. Your veterinarian will tell you the length and kind of rest your pet will need. It is often recommended that you remove toys, cat trees, and other items that encourage movement until your cat is cleared for normal activity.

Cats with a broken bone usually also need pain and anti-inflammatory medication while they recuperate at home, and open fractures generally also require treatment with antibiotics.

If your cat has a cast or splint, keep the bandage material clean and dry. Splints also require regular bandage changes; but if it becomes wet or dirty, it should be changed sooner. Bandage changes must be done by your veterinarian; the process can be painful for your cat and sedation may be needed.

Cats that have had bone surgery and those that have casts or splints will most likely be given an Elizabethan collar to prevent them from chewing on their stitches or bandages. Broken bones in cats typically heal in 6-12 weeks depending on the type of fracture, its location, your cat’s age and health, and the treatment rendered.

Cats that are older, are overweight or obese, have other medical issues such as diabetes or heart disease, or have complex fractures usually take longer to heal. Your veterinarian will recommend periodic x-rays to monitor the healing process.

599,Breeding Timing in Cats,"Breeding Timing to Maximize Fertility in Cats

Breeding timing refers to a technique that may be utilized to ensure conception in cats by the purposeful timing of insemination during the estrus (heat) period. A fertile female cat is referred to as a queen.

Symptoms and Types

In order to maximize the odds of conception with properly timed breeding, it is best to pin-point, as close as possible, the day of ovulation for the queen. Symptoms of estrus in the queen are evident by her rubbing against objects, being vocal (much more than usual), and an interest shown by the male cat. However, timing of breeding is less critical with cats and ultimately depends on the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) released, which is triggered via stimulation of the queen’s vagina and cervix.

Causes

Breeding timing and related fertility-maximizing techniques may be utilized for a number of reasons. This may be deemed necessary if there is an apparent failure to achieve conception in the queen.

Diagnosis

For cats, the most reliable method of determining the ovulation cycle is by progesterone testing.



Treatment

In order to maximize odds of conception in cats, the number of matings should be increased by breeding on successive days. The timing is not as important for cats (as opposed to dogs), as simple stimulation of the vagina and cervix increases the amount of LH released. Breeding four times a day at least two to three hours apart on the second and third days of estrus will maximize LH release and improve the odds of conception. Progesterone testing can verify the queen’s ovulation.

Living and Management

After initial fertility-maximizing measures have been taken, a follow up pregnancy examination can be performed to determine the success of the procedure. This can be done by measuring the progesterone levels in your cat. The gestation period for cats lasts from 63 to 66 days.

Prevention

Age related factors may make conception more difficult for older animals."," and Types

601,Brain Tumors in Cats,"What Are Brain Tumors in Cats?
Brain tumors are made up of abnormal cells that either develop within the brain (primary tumors) or originate elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain (secondary tumors).

Brain tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). A brain tumor looks like a mass within a section of the brain. As the tumor grows, it may either invade a cat’s brain or press against it, leading to increased intracranial pressure, inflammation, and damage to healthy brain tissue. 

Primary brain tumors are known to account for less than 2% of tumors in cats. However, the low incidence may mislead because many go undiagnosed. Diagnosis requires advanced imaging, which is often declined by pet parents due to cost. 

The most common brain tumor in cats is a benign tumor called a meningioma. Other common brain tumors in cats include gliomas, lymphosarcoma (lymphoma), choroid plexus papillomas, and pituitary tumors.

Brain tumors can be a medical emergency due to concerning symptoms, such as seizures, sudden blindness, or difficulty walking. If your cat is displaying any of these symptoms, take them to the nearest emergency hospital as soon as possible.

Symptoms of Brain Tumors in Cats
Symptoms of brain tumors can vary based on where the tumor is located within a cat’s brain, and may include:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Change in personality
	
	
	Blindness
	
	
	Misaligned eyes (strabismus)
	
	
	Restlessness
	
	
	Weakness in all four limbs (tetraparesis)
	
	
	Vocalization
	
	
	Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)
	
	
	Muscle spasms causing the head, neck, or back to arch backward (opisthotonus)
	
	
	Walking in circles
	
	
	Lack of coordination
	
	
	Loss of balance
	
	
	Difficulty swallowing
	
	
	Difficulty breathing
	
	
	Head tilt
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Head tremors
	
	
	Paralysis
	
	
	Coma
	


Causes of Brain Tumors in Cats
It’s unknown what causes brain tumors to develop in cats. There are some theories that certain factors—such as pH abnormalities (brain tissue becomes too acidic or too alkaline), metabolic imbalances (altered metabolism), or cerebral edema (swelling of the brain)—may play a role in the development of brain tumors, but these theories have yet to be proven. 

Cats over 10 years of age are more likely to have a brain tumor than younger cats.

One study showed an increase in meningiomas in domestic short-haired cats, while another study showed a higher incidence in Siamese cats. Some researchers also found a higher incidence of meningiomas in male cats. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Brain Tumors in Cats
If your veterinarian suspects a brain tumor, they may use a combination of tests to reach an accurate diagnosis, including:


	
	Medical history—It’s important to let your veterinarian know about any symptoms your cat has been displaying at home.
	
	
	Physical exam—In addition to a thorough physical exam, your veterinarian will perform a focused neurologic exam. Any neurologic abnormalities they detect can help them localize the problem to a specific part of the brain. However, a normal neurologic exam does not rule out a brain tumor.
	
	
	Blood work and urinalysis—These routine tests will screen for diseases affecting the entire body and determine if a cat can safely undergo anesthesia and surgery.
	
	
	Advanced imaging—To accurately diagnose a brain tumor, an MRI or CT scan of the brain is required, which involves the cat being placed under general anesthesia. An MRI is preferred because it provides more detail.
	
	
	Biopsy—A CT-guided biopsy, which involves obtaining a small sample of the brain tumor with the aid of CT imaging, may be used to determine the type of tumor. 
	


Treatment of Brain Tumors in Cats
Treatment of a brain tumor varies based on the type of tumor, location, and whether cancer is found in other areas of the body as well.

Treatment options may include surgery ($4,000–$7,000), chemotherapy ($2,000–$4,000), and/or radiation ($6,000–$9,000). 

The entire tumor can sometimes be surgically removed, but this is often difficult because healthy brain tissue would also need to be removed for the operation to be successful. The more brain tissue that is surgically removed, the more likely it is that neurologic problems will occur after surgery. Some meningiomas can be successfully removed with surgery, which can extend a cat’s life by up to three years, but the tumor may also regrow. 

Chemotherapy can be administered in addition to surgery or as a solo treatment option.  Lymphoma is one type of brain tumor that typically improves with chemotherapy. 

Radiation therapy is often an alternative option to surgery, and it can sometimes improve a cat’s quality of life for months.  

When cats undergo surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, they often require hospitalization.  The amount of time a cat is hospitalized depends on the type of treatment used.

Unfortunately, most brain tumors are not curable because they are not easily accessible.

Treatment is not pursued for most cats due to cost, poor prognosis, the age of the cat, and complications that can occur. Cats who do not receive treatment often die or are humanely euthanized shortly after diagnosis.

Medications that may be prescribed for cats with brain tumors include:


	
	Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and doxorubicin, for treatment of lymphoma
	
	
	Anticonvulsant medications, such as levetiracetam and zonisamide, to manage seizures
	
	
	Prednisone, for management of cerebral edema or as a palliative treatment option
	
	
	Mannitol, hypertonic saline, or furosemide, to manage edema and reduce intracranial pressure
	


Recovery and Management of Brain Tumors in Cats
Recovery from a brain tumor takes time and is dependent upon the success of treatment and how the cat responds.

If a cat undergoes surgery to remove a brain tumor, the following complications can occur from the surgery or anesthesia:


	
	Blindness
	
	
	Progression of neurologic symptoms
	
	
	Blood loss
	
	
	Acute kidney failure
	


After treatment, frequent neurologic exams and blood work will be recommended to monitor the cat’s recovery.

Frequent MRI or CT scans may be recommended to assess the size of the tumor and to screen for recurrence of a tumor after surgical removal. 

Cats may stay on anticonvulsant medications (like levetiracetam and zonisamide) long-term to reduce the risk for seizure activity.

If your cat has seizures, keeping a log of any seizure activity can be helpful in monitoring recovery. Make note of the day and time a seizure occurs, how long it lasts, and how long it takes for your cat to return to normal after the seizure. Make sure to follow up with your veterinarian when any new seizures occur.

Prevention of Brain Tumors in Cats 
Currently, there is no way to prevent a brain tumor from developing in a cat. Routine wellness exams are very important, because a veterinarian may find abnormalities during the neurologic exam and recommend additional diagnostic tests.
Brain Tumors in Cats FAQsHow long can a cat live with a brain tumor?If treatment is not pursued, a cat can live a few weeks to months depending on the type of tumor and its location.
When should you humanely euthanize a cat with a brain tumor?Euthanasia should be pursued if a cat’s quality of life is poor, such as if the cat has frequent seizures, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing, lethargy, and/or is barely eating or drinking. Humane euthanasia prevents further suffering and allows for a cat to die peacefully.
Are brain tumors in cats painful?Yes. Brain tumors are often painful because they invade brain tissue or press against it, which causes increased intracranial pressure. High pressure within the brain can lead to severe headaches and vomiting.

602,Brain Tumor (Astrocytoma) in Cats,"Astrocytoma in Cats

Although rare in cats, astrocytomas can be dangerous, even deadly. These tumors affect the brain's glial cells, which surround nerve cells (neurons), giving them support and electrically insulating them. Astrocytomas can also be rarely found in the spinal cord, and there was one reported case of an astrocytoma located in the retina.

Symptoms and Types

The astrocytoma's biologic behavior depends on the tumor's location and degree of lack of cell differentiation (graded I–IV, from best to worst prognosis). The following are some common symptoms associated with this type of brain tumor:


    Seizures
    Behavioral 	changes
    Disorientation
    Loss 	of conscious proprioception (i.e., clumsy misplacement of feet, 	tripping, etc.)
    Cranial 	nerve abnormalities
    Paralysis


Causes
 
The underlying cause for the development of astrocytomas is currently unknown.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases.

An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may indicate increased protein levels without an increase  in cell count, which is indicative of astrocytoma development. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also highly instrumental in diagnosing astrocytomas, as is radionuclide imaging, which may show an area of increased activity at the tumor site.



Treatment

Surgery and chemotherapy are both common courses of treatment when dealing with this time of brain tumor. Radiation therapy, too, can be effective; consult a veterinary oncologist if this is beneficial in the case of your cat.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your pet, where it will undergo CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, so as to monitor the cat's response to treatment. Likewise, blood work (especially a complete blood count) should be evaluated during each appointment. If the cat was prescribed seizure medication, your veterinarian may want to evaluate it earlier (7 to 10 days after prescribing the medication) to regulate the dosage accordingly."," and Types

603,Brain Injury in Cats,"There are a variety of things that can cause brain injuries in cats, including severe hyperthermia or hypothermia and prolonged seizures. Primary brain injuries, for example, involve direct trauma to the brain, which once acquired, cannot be altered. Secondary brain injury, meanwhile, is the alteration of brain tissue that occurs after primary injury, but this form of injury can be managed, prevented, and improved with optimal supportive care and treatment.



Symptoms and Types



Being that it is a vital organ, the brain requires constant supply of oxygen and nutrition. Any deficiency of oxygen or direct trauma to the brain, therefore, may result in bleeding and fluid buildup, which can cause excessive pressure on the brain. This in turn can cause complications involving the heart, eye, and several other body systems. Symptoms vary and depend on the cause and severity of the brain injury. Some of the more common symptoms include:




	Seizures
	Loss of consciousness
	Abnormal posture or irregular movements
	Ear or nose bleed
	Bleeding inside the eye (involving the retina)
	Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
	Insufficient oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia)
	Purplish or bluish patch under the mucous membranes) or under the skin due to ruptured blood vessels (ecchymosis)
	Red or purple spot on the body caused by a minor hemorrhage (petechiation)
	Heavy or rapid breathing (dyspnea or tachypnea, respectively)
	Abnormal heart functions, such as abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)




Causes



The following are some of the more common causes to brain injuries:




	Head trauma
	Severe hypothermia or hyperthermia
	Abnormally low of blood glucose (severe hypoglycemia)
	Prolonged seizures or shock
	High blood pressure
	Brain parasites
	Brain tumors
	Infections involving the nervous system
	Toxicity
	Immune-mediated diseases




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count. Although the findings for these tests depend on the underlying cause of the brain injury, often the biochemistry profile may indicate abnormalities in the blood glucose level. Blood gases are also measured to confirm oxygen deficiency in the blood.



When fractures involving the skull are suspected, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are extremely useful to evaluate the severity of the brain trauma. These diagnostic tools also help in determining the presence of bleeding, fractures, foreign bodies, tumor, and other abnormalities involving brain. The ECG (electrocardiogram), meanwhile, is used to evaluate heart functions and rhythm.



Lastly, your veterinarian may collect cerebrospinal fluid sample to determine the level of inflammation and to confirm possible infections.







Treatment



Any type of brain injury should be considered an emergency that requires immediate hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. In fact, depending on the cause of the brain injury, surgery may be required. However, often the primary goal of emergency treatment is to normalize the cat's temperature and blood pressure, provide adequate levels of oxygen and prevent hypoxia.



In order to assist with breathing, a tube will be passed into the trachea to supply oxygen. Small amounts of fluids may also be given to animals with fluid deficits in order to maintain blood pressure. To reduce brain swelling, the cat will be given medication and its head will be kept above the level of the body. In addition, the cat is turned over every two hours to avoid complications.



Pain killers are often provided to reduce pain associated with the injury. Those with severe hemorrhaging (either in the eye or in the brain) will also be given medication. In cases with low blood glucose levels, intravenous glucose supplementation is initiated, whereas in cats with high blood glucose levels, insulin may be required to reduce blood glucose levels.



Living and Management



For cats with minimal primary or secondary brain injuries, the overall prognosis is good. In fact, if no deterioration is observed within 48 hours following the head injury, the cat has a good chance of full recovery, which may take more than six months, depending on the cause and treatment of the condition.



During the recovery process, your cat should be placed in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children. Tube feeding may be necessary for the first few weeks for nutritional support. In addition, its activities should be restricted until the veterinarian advises otherwise.



It is important you watch your cat for any untoward symptoms such as unusual behaviors, bleeding, vomiting, and inform the veterinarian if any should occur immediately. Otherwise, the cat is brought in for regular follow-up exams to evaluate the neurologic functions of the patient. Frequent laboratory testing may also be required to determine the cat's overall health.



Unfortunately, cats suffering from severe primary head injuries and/or secondary brain traumas, the overall prognosis is not favorable.

Being that it is a vital organ, the brain requires constant supply of oxygen and nutrition. Any deficiency of oxygen or direct trauma to the brain, therefore, may result in bleeding and fluid buildup, which can cause excessive pressure on the brain. This in turn can cause complications involving the heart, eye, and several other body systems. Symptoms vary and depend on the cause and severity of the brain injury. Some of the more common symptoms include:




	Seizures
	Loss of consciousness
	Abnormal posture or irregular movements
	Ear or nose bleed
	Bleeding inside the eye (involving the retina)
	Bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes (cyanosis); a sign that oxygen in the blood is dangerously diminished
	Insufficient oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia)
	Purplish or bluish patch under the mucous membranes) or under the skin due to ruptured blood vessels (ecchymosis)
	Red or purple spot on the body caused by a minor hemorrhage (petechiation)
	Heavy or rapid breathing (dyspnea or tachypnea, respectively)
	Abnormal heart functions, such as abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)

604,Brain Inflammation Due to Parasitic Infection in Cats,"Encephalitis Secondary to Parasitic Migration in Cats

Also known as encephalitis, brain inflammation may be due to a variety of factors. Parasites, for instance, can migrate into the cat's central nervous system (CNS), gain entry via blood or through adjacent tissues, including the middle ear, natural opening in the skull, nasal cavities and cribriform plate (part of the skull), or open fontanelles, also called “soft spots.”

These parasites may normally affect another organ system of the same host (e.g., Dirofilaria immitis, Taenia, Ancylostoma caninum, Angiostrongylus), or a different host species (e.g., raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis; skunk roundworm, B. columnaris; Coenurus spp., or Cysticercus cellulosae). Dirofilaria immitis is most often seen in adult cats, while the other parasites generally infect younger kittens that are exposed to the outdoors.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms associated with this type of encephalitis will vary depending on the portion of CNS affected. Cuterebriasis, for example, occurs mainly between July and October in the U.S. and is characterized by the sudden onset of behavior changes, seizures, and vision issues. In addition, parasite infections are often asymmetrical, affecting one side but not the other.

Causes

The most common way a cat acquires this type of encephalitis is by being housed in a cage that has been previously occupied by an infected host; e.g., raccoons, skunks.

  

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal unless the parasites have also migrated into other organs.

Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may reveal a focal lesion and/or cerebral tissue death from blockage of cerebral blood vessels, both of which are consistent with parasitic infections. A cerebrospinal fluid tap is another common diagnostic method used to confirm parasitic infection; however, the tap may yield normal results despite encephalitis.

Treatment

Medication such as anthelmintics (dewormers) may be used to kill off the parasites, but they may also lead to other complications. Consult your veterinarian for the best course of treatment. Kittens with a mild form of angiostrongylosis may even recover fully with just supportive care and corticosteroid therapy. In other cases, surgical removal of intercranial parasites (e.g., Cuterebra) may be necessary.

Prevention

Most parasitic infections of the central nervous system are incurable and progress in severity. To prevent your cat from contracting such infections keep it indoors and away from wild animals. Dewormers, anthelmintics, and dirofilaricides can also prevent infection."," and Types

605,Brain Disorder Due to Liver Disease in Cats,"Hepatic Encephalopathy in Cats

Encephalopathy is the medical term for any disorder of the brain, and hepatic refers to the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy is a metabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. It develops secondary to liver disease (known as hepatopathy). Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by an accumulation of ammonia in the system due to the liver's inability to rid the body of the substance.

The liver is the largest gland in the body, performing a number of essential functions, including the production of bile (a fluid substance involved in the digestion of fats), production of albumin (a protein in the plasma of the blood), and detoxification of drugs and other chemicals (such as ammonia) in the body.

A portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is a condition in which blood vessels allow blood to flow abnormally between the portal vein (the vein that normally carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver) and into the body's blood circulation without first being filtered through the liver. This condition can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (a condition that develops sometime later in life).

Congenital portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is genetically inherited in some breeds and will generally present at a young age. With acquired forms of this disease, symptoms can occur at any age.

Symptoms and Types


    Circling, running into walls and acting confused after meals
    Learning disabilities (difficult to train)
    Sluggishness (lethargy) and/or drowsiness or sleepiness
    Aimless wandering
    Compulsive pacing
    Head pressing
    Blindness related to brain abnormality
    Seizures
    Coma
    Sudden aggression
    Vocalizing
    Lack of appetite
    Increased urination or lack of urination
    Frequent voiding of small volumes
    Orange-brown urine
    Increased thirst
    Excessive salivation
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Stunted growth
    Prolonged recovery from sedation or anesthesia
    Dramatic temporary resolution of signs may occur with antibiotic or lactulose (synthetic sugar) therapy


Causes


    Congenital (genetically acquired)
    Acquired portosystemic shunt occurs with diseases that can lead to high blood pressure in the vein carrying blood from the digestive organs to the liver  - such as occurs with progressive damage and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)
    Sudden (acute) liver failure can be induced by drugs, toxins, or infection
    Alkalosis (high blood alkaline levels)
    Low blood potassium
    Certain anesthetics and sedatives
    Methionine, tetracycline and antihistamines
    Bleeding into the intestine
    Transfusion predisposes
    Infections
    Constipation
    Muscle wasting




Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any background information you have on your cat's parentage. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with standard tests including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. Your veterinarian will use the bloodwork to confirm or rule out impaired kidney function.

X-ray and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the liver.  Its appearance will change in certain diseased states. If this appears to be the case your veterinarian may take a sample from the liver by aspiration or biopsy in order to reach a conclusive diagnosis.

Treatment

Most patients showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy should be hospitalized.  Medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian to help improve dietary protein tolerance, and your cat's diet should be switched to a diet that is designed for liver or kidney disease. Your cat will need to be placed in a protective environment so that activity is restricted. You may want to consider cage rest during the recovery and therapy process. Oxygen therapy and fluid therapy with electrolyte and vitamin supplementation will need to be given to stabilize your cat's health, and you will also need to take care to keep your cat warm while it is recovering.

To assure your cat is receiving enough calories, a feeding tube may need to be inserted. Should this be necessary, your veterinarian will go over this process with you for home care.

If the source of the liver disease is a congenital shunt, surgical correction may resolve the condition. If the portosystemic shunt was acquired, abnormal blood vessels should not be tied off.

Zinc supplementation can be given as needed. Other treatments that may be prescribed are antibiotics, enemas, diuretics and seizure-control medications.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat according to the underlying diseased state. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat's symptoms return or worsen, if your cat loses weight, or if your cat begins to look unwell."," and Types

606,Brain Cell Degeneration in Cats,"Neuroaxonal Dystrophy in Cats

Neuroaxonal dystrophy is a group of inherited abiotrophies affecting different parts of brain. The term abiotrophy is used to denote loss of function due to degeneration of cells or tissues without known reasons. The age at onset varies in different breeds, but it is generally at about five weeks in cats.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms depend on the part of the brain that is affected.

    Abnormal placement of limbs while 	walking
    Strength in limbs is usually 	normal in affected patients
    Mild tremor of head and neck

Causes


    No known cause
    Inherited factors


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including background history and a descriptions of the onset of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your  veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these routine laboratory tests are usually within normal ranges. Diagnosis of neuroaxonal dystrophy is usually accomplished by differential diagnosis. That is, by excluding other diseases and conditions until the correct cause for the condition is settled upon. A concrete diagnosis is usually made during postmortem of affected patients.

Treatment

No specific treatment is available to alter the course of this disease.

Living and Management

Activity is restricted in affected cats to prevent falls. This disease is not necessarily fatal, but may lead to incapacitation in affected cats. Observe your cat’s activity, and do what you can to make sure that your cat does not injure itself in preventable falls, such as with swimming pools, stairs and open windows."," and Types

607,Brain and Spinal Cord Inflammation (Polioencephalomyelitis) in Cats,"Polioencephalomyelitis in Cats

Polioencephalomyelitis is a non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis(non-draining inflammation of the gray matter of the brain and spinal cord).  This condition causes nerve degeneration, and demyelination (degeneration of the sheath surrounding the nerve) of the neurons in the thoracic spinal cord (upper back). Lesions can also be seen in the cervical spinal cord (neck), lumbar spinal cord (lower back), brainstem (base of the brain), and the cerebrum (the largest part of the brain).

Symptoms and Types


    Ataxia: 	chronic, progressive incoordination of the hind limbs, or of all 	four limbs
    Paraparesis: 	weakness in the lower body
    Seizures
    Head 	tremors

 
Causes

Polioencephalomyelitis is a viral infection, most likely spread through mucus from the nose and mouth. It is suspected to be caused by the Borna virus, an infection of the brain tissue that affects several mammalian populations, but this is unproven. The cause of this disease has a long documented history, but its origin is generally unknown.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to rule out or confirm other diseases. The doctor may also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory cellular analysis.

You will need to provide a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms.



Treatment

Steroid therapy may reduce inflammation and improve clinical signs, at least temporarily.

Living and Management

There is very little known about this disease. Unfortunately, what is known is that it is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Most animals with this disease will need to be euthanized, since the symptoms will only worsen."," and Types

608,"Brain and Spinal Cord Inflammation (Meningoencephalomyelitis, Eosinophilic) in Cats","Meningoencephalomyelitis in Cats
 
Although rare in cats, eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis is a condition that causes the inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and their membranes due to abnormally high numbers of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Often, the increase of eosinophils is in response to a parasite infection, tumor or allergic reaction in the cat.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Symptoms vary in location and severity, but are often related to the nervous system such as circling, loss of memory, seizures and blindness.
 
Causes
 
It is common for the underlying cause to the eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis to be idiopathic (or unknown) in nature. Other typical factors associated with this disease include:
 

    Allergies (also common)
    Tumors
    Parasite infections
    Fungal infections
    Vaccinations

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination and several laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- to help identify and isolate the cause of inflammation.
 
Blood testing may reveal abnormally high number of eiosinophils in the blood. Biochemistry profiling, for example, may show abnormal liver enzyme activity, indicating parasitic infections. And magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal tumorous lesions in the cat's brain or spinal cord.

 
One of the most important diagnostic tests, however, is CSF (or cerebrospinal fluid) analysis. A sample of your cat's CSF will be collected and sent to a laboratory for culturing and further evaluation. In case of idiopathic or allergic causes, abnormally high numbers of eiosinophils are seen in the CSF. Tumors, meanwhile, are generally associated with an abnormally low number of white blood cells along with a small number of eiosinophils in the CSF.


 


Treatment 
 
Due to the severity of the disease, most cats with eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis will need to be hospitalized. In cases where no underlying cause can be identified (idiopathic), your veterinarian may prescribe steroids for a few weeks to control inflammation. Otherwise, cats are kept on certain diet and movement restrictions until a cause, and more specific treatment regimen, can be found.
 
Living and Management
 
Overall prognosis heavily depends on the underlying cause of the disease. However, prognosis is good if aggressive treatment is conducted quickly -- most cats will improve within first 72 hours and recover after six to eight weeks.
 
During hospitalization, your cat is often examined every six hours. Post-treatment, the veterinarian may request that you bring the cat for regular follow-up evaluations."," and Types
 
Symptoms vary in location and severity, but are often related to the nervous system such as circling, loss of memory, seizures and blindness.

609,Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome In Cats,"What Is Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats?
Brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is caused by deformities of the facial bones, nares (nostrils), soft palate, trachea, or larynx. Brachy means “short or shortened,” and cephalic refers to the head; thus, brachycephalic is the term given to short-headed or short-faced cats such as the Persian, Himalayan, and Burmese breeds. Not all brachycephalic breeds will develop brachycephalic airway syndrome, but many will.
Symptoms of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats
The symptoms of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats can vary depending on the severity and number of airway problems. Not every brachycephalic cat will have every symptom, but some possible symptoms include:


	
	Open-mouth breathing (having to open the mouth to breathe)
	
	
	Increased breathing effort
	
	
	Noisy or raspy breathing
	
	
	Snoring while relaxed or asleep
	
	
	Reverse sneezing (forceful inhalations that sound like short burst of snoring)
	
	
	Coughing or gagging
	
	
	Heat intolerance
	
	
	Exercise intolerance, or collapsing during exercise or play
	

Causes of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats
Brachycephalic airway syndrome refers to a specific set of upper airway abnormalities and their resulting symptoms. Possible upper airway abnormalities include:


	
	Stenotic nares–Many brachycephalic breeds have small, narrow nares, or nostrils. This narrowing results in restriction of airflow entering the nostrils. This can be dangerous when the cat has an upper respiratory infection, as mucus discharge in the nostrils further blocks air flow.
	
	
	Elongated soft palate–The soft part of the roof of the mouth is called the soft palate, and in brachycephalic breeds, it tends to be longer than normal. This elongation results in partial blockage of the trachea (windpipe) and can cause less airflow into the lungs.
	
	
	Hypoplastic trachea–Some brachycephalic cat breeds can also have a windpipe that is narrower than normal. This narrowing can result in less airflow into the lungs.
	
	
	Everted laryngeal saccules–All cats have small saccules (pouches of tissue) just inside the larynx (voice box). However, in brachycephalic airway syndrome, the saccules evert, or get displaced outward, because of the extra breathing effort caused by the stenotic nares and the elongated soft palate. This eversion of the saccules causes further blockage of airflow.
	

How Veterinarians Diagnose Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats
A probable diagnosis of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats can be made through physical examination alone; a cat’s breed, facial structure, and external physical features can help in the diagnosis. However, to find out the severity of brachycephalic airway syndrome, more testing may be needed.

Anesthesia is needed to allow a thorough laryngeal and soft palate exam, as these structures are next to impossible to see well in an awake cat. Your veterinarian will likely recommend pre-anesthetic testing that may include blood tests to check the function of internal organs, chest X-rays to check the heart and lungs, or an EKG to screen for heart abnormalities.
 Treatment of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats
Treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome varies depending on severity and quantity of deformed body parts. Regardless of severity, early diagnosis and treatment is ideal, as symptoms tend to worsen the longer brachycephalic airway syndrome goes untreated.

In mild cases, a conservative management may be considered by addressing contributing factors such as weight management, avoiding hot or humid conditions, limiting play or exercise, and treating respiratory infections early and aggressively. In some cases, antihistamines may be recommended to help keep airway secretions (mucus) to a minimum. Other medications, such as Onsior®, may be recommended to treat symptom flare-ups.

Surgery for Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats

In more advanced cases, surgery to fix the stenotic nostrils and/or elongated soft palate may be all that is needed to improve airflow and quality of life, especially if treatment is started early on. Some general practitioners are comfortable doing such surgeries, while others may refer their patients to a surgical specialist.

Surgical correction of stenotic nostrils is called a rhinoplasty, and it involves removing a part of the nasal tissue to make the opening of the nares bigger to improve airflow. Similarly, surgical correction of an elongated soft palate involves surgically removing a part of the soft palate to improve airflow and stop the risk of tracheal blockage. This surgery is called a staphylectomy.

In severe cases, or in cases where treatment has been delayed, surgical removal of the laryngeal saccules may be recommended to further improve airflow.
Recovery and Management of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome
Recovery from surgery can vary depending on the procedure. For stenotic nares correction, recovery is relatively easy. Pain management and preventing rubbing of the nose by using an Elizabethan collar or recovery cone, are typically recommended for about a week after surgery.

If surgery involves soft palate removal or laryngeal saccule removal, an overnight stay at a 24-hour care facility may be recommended. Post-op swelling and severe pain can occasionally be a problem after these procedures, and having your cat closely watched is important for safety and proper pain management. Additionally, a soft diet will likely be recommended for the week following surgery.

The prognosis for cats with brachycephalic airway syndrome depends on the severity of their symptoms, how many anatomical abnormalities are present, the age at diagnosis, the age at treatment, and the presence of other diseases.

Prevention of Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats

Since brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is congenital (present from birth), and is a result of improperly formed body parts, it can only be prevented by following good breeding practices. Any cat with a history of brachycephalic airway syndrome should not be bred. Likewise, cats with less severe brachycephalic conformation should be favored in any breeding program.
Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome in Cats FAQsHow much does brachycephalic airway syndrome surgery in cats cost?The average cost of surgery for the treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats varies, depending on the number of procedures needed, as well as whether a general practitioner or a specialist is used. Costs can range from $900 to $3,000.
 What is the most common symptom in cats with brachycephalic airway syndrome?The most common symptom in cats with brachycephalic airway syndrome is open-mouth breathing. Open-mouth breathing can look like opening the mouth slightly with each inhalation or exhalation, or it can also look like keeping the mouth open all the time. It is never normal for a cat to breathe with their mouth open for any length of time, and cats who are open-mouth breathing should be examined by a veterinarian right away.
Can brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats be prevented?Since brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is congenital (present at birth) and is a result of anatomical abnormalities, it can only be prevented by following good breeding practices.

610,Botulism in Cats,"Clostridium botulinum in Cats
 
Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic disease related to ingestion of raw meat and dead animals. The Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin causes spreading weakness, starting in the back legs and ascending to the trunk, front legs, and neck, followed by paralysis of all four limbs.

Cats are generally resistant to the more severe effects of this toxin, but in some cases they may become severely ill. Typically, disease conditions occur within a few hours to six days after eating spoiled animal meat that is infected with the Clostridium botulinum type C preformed neurotoxin.
 
Mildly affected cats generally recover over a period of several days with supportive treatment. However, cats that are having difficulties breathing will require intensive care monitoring. In severe cases, paralysis can affect the ability to breath killing the affected animal. 
 
Symptoms and Types




    Sudden spreading      weakness starting in hind legs and ascending to the trunk, front legs, and      neck
    Severe weakness      of all four legs or paralysis of all four limbs (which usually occurs within 12 to 24 hours of onset)

 
Causes
 

    Clostridium      botulinum type C preformed neurotoxin, eaten in dead animal carcasses, or      in uncooked or spoiled foods

 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as contact with spoiled meat or dead animals. 
 
Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam of your cat, with standard tests including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count and urinalysis. Blood will also be taken to test for the presence of botulinum toxin in the blood serum. Likewise, your veterinarian may take a stool sample or vomit to test for the the toxin. 
 
X-rays of your cat's chest may be taken to check the health of the lungs and upper digestive tract, as this toxin can cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles.   
 
 
Treatment

Your veterinarian will treat your cat according to how severely or mildly it is affected by the botulinum toxin. If it is a mild reaction, your cat may be temporarily hospitalized and treated with a urinary catheter and intravenous feeding. However, if your cat is severely affected and is having trouble breathing due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, it will need close monitoring in an intensive care unit. Under these circumstances, your cat will have a stomach tube placed for feeding and will be hooked up to a ventilator to assist its breathing.

Regardless of the severity, however, a type C antitoxin will be given to your cat to neutralize the botulinum toxin and prevent further progression. Complete recovery usually takes place over 1 to 3 weeks. 
 
Living and Management
 
Because it is easier to prevent this disease than treat it, you should never allow your cat to eat dead carcasses or spoiled raw meat. If you live in a rural area where this is a possibility, you will need to be on guard, as far as checking your property regularly for the presence of dead animals. 
 
Likewise, in an urban area, where cats come into contact with rodents and other foraging animals, you will need to be aware of the symptoms of various diseases that can affect your cat as a result of eating these animals. In addition, you should always feed your cat food that has been thoroughly cooked."," and Types

611,Bone Tumor (Hemangiosarcoma) in Cats,"Hemangiosarcoma of the Bone in Cats

Hemangiosarcoma is a fast spreading tumor of the endothelial cells, which line the interior surface of the body's blood vessels, including the arteries, veins, intestinal tract, and the bronchi of the lungs.

The integrity of the bone may be compromised by the tumor, and fractures in the bone,   absent an accident related trauma to the body, are characteristic of bone cancer. Most commonly, this type of tumor is found on the limbs or ribs, but it can occur in other locations as well.

As with many types of cancers, hemangiosarcoma is usually diagnosed in cats older than 17 years.

Symptoms and Types


    If tumor is on leg, lameness 	and/or swelling
    Fracture due to weakness in bone
    Swelling at affected site
    Difficult breathing may be present 	if tumor involves the rib
    Pale mucous membranes (i.e., 	nostrils, lips, ears, genitals)
    Anemia due to blood loss from 	ruptured tumor


Causes

The exact cause for hemangiosarcoma of the bone is still unknown.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood profile, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests may indicate whether any of the organs are being affected, and whether any other conditions are present.  Some of the conditions that may be concurrent with hamangiosarcoma are regenerative anemia, which is determined by an abnormally high number of immature red blood cells (meaning that the body is replacing lost red blood cells at a high rate); an abnormally low level of protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia); an abnormally high white blood cell count (leukocytosis), which can be indicative that the body is fighting off a diseased condition; a low level of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia), which are responsible for blood clotting; and blood cells of unequal or abnormal size (anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, respectively).

Radiographic studies of the affected bone will also reveal valuable information to help your veterinarian in the diagnosis of this tumor. Computed tomography (CT) scans can help to determine the extent of bone involvement and also help your veterinarian in planning an effective surgery. Biopsy may be attempted for a definitive diagnosis, but this may not be practical for this type of tumor, since it originates in the vessels.

A confirmative diagnosis may be based on finding spaces within the vessels that are filled with red blood cells, clots, dead cellular debris, and variable tumor cells.
 
  

Treatment

Aggressive surgery remains the method of choice in the treatment of this tumor. The  tumor, and possibly the surrounding area, will need to be removed entirely. If the tumor is occurring on a limb, the affected limb will most probably be amputated, a surgery which most cats recover from well. An axial tumor – one that is affecting the area of the head or trunk – may be more difficult to treat. Chemotherapy along with surgery is the recommended treatment plan.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for progress evaluation visits, starting from the first month after initial treatment and every three months following. Chemotherapy medications have the possibility of toxic side effects, so your veterinarian will need to closely monitor your cat's stability, changing dosage as necessary. Routine x-rays will be taken of the chest, heart and abdomen to check for recurrence and progress.

After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort. Use pain medications with caution; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication. Follow all directions carefully. You will need to limit your cat's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets. You might consider cage rest for your cat, to limit its physical activity. Your veterinarian will tell you when it is safe for your cat to move about again. Most cats recover well from amputation, and learn to compensate for the lost limb.

It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. If your cat does not feel up to eating, you may need to use a feeding tube so that it is getting all of the nutrition it needs to completely recover. Your veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule. While your cat is in the process of healing, you may set the litter box up closer to where your cat rests, and make it so that it is easy to get in and out of the box.

Each cat is different, and some will survive longer than others, but the average time of survival after surgery is six months. Less than ten percent will survive for one year after surgery."," and Types

612,Bone Overgrowth in Cats,"Hypertrophic Osteopathy in Cats
 
Though rare in cats, hypertrophic osteopathy can create extreme discomfort and pain in your pet. It refers to an abnormal increase in size of bone due to new bone formation, which may cause swellings at all four limbs and is often confused with arthritis. Hypertrophic osteopathy may also cause lameness due to swelling and pain at joints and bones.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Lethargy
    Reluctance to move
    Swellings at distal portions of limbs, especially forelimbs
    Painful limbs
    Edema on limbs
    Decreased movement in joints due to swelling
    Lameness

 
Causes
 
The exact cause of new bone formation is still unknown, but this condition has been seen in association with various diseases, including:
 

    Pneumonia
    Heartworm disease
    Heart disease
    Tumor of urinary bladder
    Tumor of liver and prostate gland
    Lung tumors metastasizing to the affected areas


  
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will take a detailed history, asking you about the duration and frequency of symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. The results are usually normal but may vary depending on the underlying disease, if present. X-rays of the bone may reveal new bone formation and help your veterinarian in localizing the disease. He or she may also decide to take bone sample for further evaluation, including investigating for the presence of tumors.





Treatment
 
Diagnosis of the underlying cause and treating it are major goals for the resolution of the problem. However, as exact etiology is still unknown, finding the underlying cause and treating it is not always possible. Your veterinarian will prescribe painkillers to alleviate pain and drugs to reduce swelling at affected sites. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the tumor mass.
 
Living and Management
 
It is important to follow the guidelines and administer medication at the right dosage and time to maintain quality of life. But even after treatment of the primary cause, clinical symptoms may continue for one to two weeks. Bone(s), meanwhile, may take months to get back to its original shape, even with the correction of the underlying disorder and are not known to be fully reversible. Your cat may feel sore and may need therapy for pain management at home.
 
If a metastic tumor is the underlying cause of the hypertrophic osteopathy, prognosis is very poor."," and Types

613,Bone Marrow Cancer (Myeloma) in Cats,"Multiple Myeloma in Cats

Multiple myeloma is an uncommon cancer that is derived from a clonal population of cancerous (malignant) plasma cells in the bone marrow. A “clonal population of cells” is a group of cells that have descended from a single cell; all of them have the same genetic make-up. Plasma cells are specialized white-blood cells, lymphocytes that have been altered to produce immunoglobulin, an immune protein or antibody necessary for fighting disease.

Three of four defining features must be present for a diagnosis of multiple myeloma: immune protein from a single clone of cells (known as a monoclonal gammopathy), seen as a spike in the gamma region of a protein analysis of the blood (known as a protein electrophoresis); cancerous plasma cells or a high number of plasma cells in the bone marrow (known as plasmacytosis); destruction of areas of bone (known as lytic bone lesions); and a particular type of protein found in the urine (known as Bence Jones [light-chain] proteinuria).

Multiple myeloma occurs primarily in middle-aged or older cats (6-13 years).

Symptoms and Types
 
Attributed to bone infiltration and destruction of bone, effects of proteins produced by the tumor (such as increased protein in the blood leading to sludging of the blood and kidney damage), and infiltration of organ(s) by cancerous cells. Symptoms depend on location and extent of disease.

Causes

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. Along with a thorough physical examination, your veterinarian will also conduct a thorough ophthalmological examination on your cat, if the eyes are showing symptoms of a diseased state.



Symptoms for multiple myeloma resemble those of several other diseases. Your veterinarian will need to rule out a number of other possibilities for the symptoms, such as infections, other types of tumors, and immune-mediated illnesses. To do that, your doctor will conduct a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Diagnostic imaging will include X-rays of the vertebra and limbs to look for bone lesions, and ultrasound to examine the internal organs.

Treatment

Your veterinarian may need to refer you to a veterinary oncologist for the latest information regarding treatment of this disease. Your cat may be hospitalized if there are high levels of urea - waste products and calcium in the blood. Also, if there is a bleeding disorder, or a significant bacterial infection, hospitalization may be required. A blood-cleansing procedure may be used, or blood may be withdrawn and replaced with an equal volume of fluids.

If possible, radiation therapy may be used on isolated areas, with the goal of curing the disease, or only to control signs and improve your cat’s condition. If there is a concurrent bacterial infection, it will be treated aggressively with antibiotics.

If your cat is being treated with radiation or chemical therapy, it will also need to be guarded against opportunistic infections that can result from the expected lowered immune response (known as immune compromised – a result of the treatment that is used to stop the growth of cancerous cells in the body). You will need to take care to prevent bacterial infections from occurring, such as those caused by puncture wounds from dog or cat fights. Dietary changes will be necessary if your cat is in kidney failure. Affected areas that are nonresponsive to chemotherapy, or single, solitary lesions may be removed surgically.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to do a complete blood count and platelet count weekly for at least four weeks to assess bone-marrow response to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Blood tests with abnormal results will be repeated monthly to evaluate response to the treatment.

Protein analyses of the blood will be done monthly for several months until normal protein patterns are obtained. Once protein patterns have stabilized, monitoring will be periodically performed for signs of relapse. Abnormal skeletal X-rays should be repeated monthly every other month until they appear normal, and to evaluate your cat’s response to treatment.

Chemotherapy is intended to improve your cat’s condition, not to cure the multiple myeloma, but long remissions are possible. Relapse is an expected occurrence. The drugs that are being used will determine the side effects. Your veterinarian will go over what to expect, based on the types of drugs that are prescribed for treatment. Most patients develop mild low white-blood cell counts (leukopenia) during chemotherapy."," and Types

614,Blood Transfusion Reactions in Cats,"There are a variety of reactions that can occur with the transfusion of any blood product. Purebred cats, especially those that have had previous blood transfusions, are at a higher risk for having severe reactions to transfusion than other animals. Most reactions usually occur during, or shortly after, the transfusion.

Symptoms and Types
 
Reaction to a blood transfusion may be classified by one of the following conditions: immune system related; acute reaction (an immediate, sudden reaction); or delayed reaction.
 
Acute symptoms of a reaction to blood transfusion may include fever, vomiting, weakness, incontinence, shock, collapse, and general loss of transfusion effectiveness. Symptoms of a delayed reaction are usually not directly apparent and result only in a loss of the transfusion’s effectiveness.
 
Many symptoms will vary, depending on the exact cause. Transfusion of contaminated blood can result in fever, shock, and septicemia -- an invasion of disease producing bacteria into the bloodstream. Circulatory overload resulting from rapid or excessive transfusion can result in vomiting, cough, and heart failure. Hypothermia, which can stem from transfusion of cold refrigerated blood -- usually in smaller cats or already hypothermic cats -- is evident by shivering and impaired platelet function.
 
Causes
 
There are several circumstances that may be responsible for a blood transfusion reaction, such as transfusion of a mismatched blood type; transfusion of contaminated blood and consequent blood-born disease from an infected donor; circulatory overload caused by too-rapid or too-large amounts of transfusion; or transfusion of damaged red blood cells which have been improperly stored (i.e., due to excessive heating or freezing). In addition to these causes, the cat’s immune system may react to various components in the donor’s blood. Symptoms will usually surface in the course of 3-14 days.
 
Diagnosis
 
A diagnosis of blood transfusion reaction is based largely on symptoms that present after transfusion. Tests include a urine analysis, retesting of blood type to confirm rejection of donor blood, and a bacteria analysis of the transfused blood.
 
Symptoms of reaction that result in fever or hypotension (low blood pressure ) may also be diagnosed as inflammatory disease, or may be found to have been caused by an infectious disease.
 
  
 
Treatment
 
If your cat exhibits a reaction to a blood transfusion, your veterinarian will immediately discontinue the transfusion and administer fluids in order to maintain blood pressure and circulation. Depending on the severity and cause of the reaction, additional interventions may be necessary. Specific treatment depends on the cause and symptoms, and may also be administered through medication. For example, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be given for septicemia, or for bacterial infection.
 
Living and Management
 
Your cat’s basic vital signs (breathing and pulse) will be tracked before, during, and after a blood transfusion. In addition, temperature, lung sounds, and plasma color should be checked frequently.
 
Prevention
 
Blood transfusion reactions may be prevented by following standard blood transfusion protocol: thorough cross-checking of blood types to assure a match, condition of donor blood to prevent infection or spread of disease, and appropriate storage of donor blood. Transfusion should begin initially at an amount of one milliliter per minute, and all transfusion activity should be appropriately recorded in the patient’s medical file."," and Types

"
615,Blood Thickening in Cats,"Polycythemia Vera in Cats
 
Polycythemia vera is a blood disorder that involves abnormal blood thickening due to an increase of red blood cell production by the bone marrow. It is primarily seen in older cats.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
The following symptoms gradually appear but run a chronic course:
 

    Weakness
    Depression
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Redness of skin (erythema)
    Increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria)

 
Causes
 
Although the viscosity of the blood is due to an increased production of red blood cells by the bone marrow, the cause of this overproduction is currently unknown.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing will typically reveal an increase in red blood cell mass, and in about 50 percent of cats, an increased number of white blood cells (leukocytosis). 
 
To assess the function of the kidneys and cardiopulmonary systems, your veterinarian will conduct X-rays and abdominal ultrasounds. Echocardiography, meanwhile, is used to evaluate the cardiac functions. He or she will also take a sample of bone marrow and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further examination.

 


Treatment
 
Initially, the veterinarian will draw a fair amount of blood and replace it with intravenous fluids to decrease the blood's viscosity. However, this is only for quick relief. Long-term therapy, for both animals and humans, involve using an antineoplastic drug called hydroxyurea, which suppresses the overproduction of red blood cells in the bone marrow.
 
Living and Management
 
During treatment, your veterinarian will need to see the cat for regular follow-up exams, especially when it is taking hydroxurea, as it may sometimes cause bone marrow suppression. In addition, follow the veterinary oncologist's dosage recommendation when using on chemotherapy medications, such as hydroxurea, because these drugs are highly toxic."," and Types

616,Blood Related Deficiencies in Cats,"Pancytopenia in Cats



Pancytopenia does not actually refer to a disease, but rather to the simultaneous development of a number of blood-related deficiencies: non-regenerative anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The root word pan refers to all or whole, and cytopenia refers to a lack of cells circulating in the blood.



Nonregenerative anemia is a condition characterized by a low red-blood cell count and the bone marrow’s lack of response to produce additionally needed red-blood cells; leucopenia refers to a low white-blood cell count; and thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet and thrombocyte count (the cells that function in blood coagulation).

 

Pancytopenia can affect both cats and dogs, and may develop from a number of multiple causes. There is no specific age, or breed of animal known to be more susceptible to the development of pancytopenia.



If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library.

 

Symptoms and Types

 

The symptoms that develop in the patient depend largely on the underlying cause leading to pancytopenia. Some symptoms of leucopenia (low white-blood cell count) include repeated episodes of fever, and frequent or persistent infections. Some symptoms of anemia due to low red-blood cell count include sluggishness and pale gums.

 

Low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia may lead to tiny pinpoint bruises on the body, referred to as petechial hemorrhate, or bleeding from the moist tissues of the body, known as mucosal bleeding.

 

Other general symptoms may include lethargy, bleeding (i.e., nose bleeds or blood in the urine), and fever.

 

Causes

 

There are a variety of causes for pancytopenia. These include infectious diseases, such as hepatitis; the tick-born disease ehrlichiosis, exposure to poisons such as thallium; proliferative diseases such as bone marrow cancer; and immune-mediated diseases such as aplastic anemia, in which the bone marrow loses its ability to produce red-blood cells.

 

A veterinary exam is necessary to determine the underlying cause of pancytopenia, and to diagnose the condition itself.

 

Diagnosis

 

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood count, and a chemical blood profile. Other possible tests include urine analysis, immunologic tests for infections diseases like feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and a bone marrow examination. You  will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, and onset of symptoms, if any.

 

 

 



Treatment

 

Treatment depends on the primary condition that led to pancytopenia, as it is essential that the primary disease be diagnosed and treated first. Aggressive antibiotic therapy and blood transfusions may be necessary. Medications for the underlying cause may be necessary, in addition to various medications to stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood-cell that fights infection), and another medication to stimulate the production of red-blood cells by bone marrow.

 

Living and Management

 

Daily physical examinations should be given after initial treatment, including frequent monitoring of body temperature and a periodic complete blood count (CBC). The frequency of CBC checks depends on how severely low the cat’s blood-cell and platelet counts were and are, as well as the underlying cause of the disease.

 

Additional care measures depend upon the underlying cause of disease. Depending on the severity, these may include inpatient care at a hospital, and aggressive therapy.

 

Prevention

 

There are many causes of pancytopenia, and it is not possible to prevent against all of them. However, some precautions can be taken. Cats should be kept up to date with vaccinations that may prevent infectious diseases.

 

For cats with cancer, there is a danger of developing pancytopenia as a side effect of cancer treatment, and frequent CBC monitoring will need to be done."," and Types

617,Blood in the Front of the Eye in Cats,"Hyphema in Cats



Hyphema, or blood in the anterior chamber of the eye, is a common condition among cats. However, hyphema is a clinical sign and not a specific disease in itself.



Symptoms and Types



The symptoms of hyphema are dependent on the extent of bleeding, whether vision has been impaired, and whether your cat has other systemic diseases.



The most common signs found during a physical examination are:




	Blood within the anterior chamber of the eye
	Corneal edema or corneal lesions
	Intraocular Pressure (IOP) may be elevated




Causes



The most common causes of hyphema are:




	Injury, trauma to the eye or head
	Severe retinal detachment
	Hypertension, hyperthyroidism, systemic deficiencies
	Infection by parasites
	Bleeding of the vessels, vasculitis, uveitis, uveal neoplasia, and particularly lymphoma
	Ocular defects - retinal dysplasia, glaucoma, etc.




Hyphema can also be indicative of various ocular and systemic deficiencies. Therefore, diagnosis and proper treatment is very important.



Diagnosis



Hyphema is diagnosed through hematology and blood biochemistry, lab tests, and diagnostic imaging using X-rays and ultrasound tests.



A complete medical history is taken and a thorough physical examination is performed to include or exclude possible causes.



Common diagnostic tests and procedures include:




	Complete blood count with platelet count
	Serum biochemistry to measure serum levels in protein
	Coagulopathy tests to assess blood coagulation functions
	Blood pressure
	Urinalysis, to exclude kidney diseases
	Chest and abdominal X-rays
	Ocular ultrasounds (ultrasonography) to investigate the anterior portion of the eye and include or exclude possibilities of retinal detachment, lens displacement, abnormal masses, and vitreal hemorrhage








Other advanced tests that may be performed include abdominal ultrasounds, X-rays of the head and eye orbit to detect traumatic injuries, and hormonal tests (assays) of the adrenal glands. To detect bone marrow cancer, a bone marrow aspirate - the liquid found within the bone marrow - may also be done.





Treatment



The objectives of hyphema treatment involve containing the inflammation and removing the underlying causes which contribute to bleeding in the anterior chamber of the eye.



The common approaches to treatment are:




	Use of corticosteroids as eye drops or ointment to cure inflammation arising out of the bleeding
	Atropine eye drops to dilate the pupil, which minimizes sticking between the lens and the iris
	Initiation of appropriate treatment for ocular deficiencies like retinal abnormalities (i.e., dysplasia), glaucoma, etc.




Surgery may also be necessary for correcting traumatic injuries and lesions.



Your cat's activity will need to be restricted if the problem has been caused by a clotting disorder, since clots can quickly become fatal with movement of blood through the arteries. In addition, if hyphema has significantly damaged your cat's vision, the cat should not be allowed to go outside without close supervision. Regular monitoring of the fluid pressure within the eye is also very important - daily for severe diseases and in less severe cases, every two to three days until it clears up. To prevent further injury to the eye, your veterinarian can provide you with an Elizabethan collar, so that your cat cannot scratch at its eye.



Unless irreversible damage has been caused to the ocular structures, the prognosis is usually good in cases of eye trauma. If retinal detachment has occurred, secondary glaucoma will eventually develop, and surgical intervention may be necessary for the relief of pain."," and Types

618,Blood in the Chest in Cats,"Hemothorax in Cats

Hemothorax is the medical term used to identify a condition in which blood has collected in the chest cavity, or thorax. This condition may occur suddenly or over a long period of time, and it can occur for a variety of reasons. There does not appear to be a particular age, gender, or breed of cat that is more predisposed to this condition than another.

Symptoms and Types

Acute onset:

    Symptoms of decreased blood volume usually occur before sufficient blood volume accumulates in the pleural space (lining of the chest cavity)
    Impaired respiration/respiratory distress
    Pale membranes
    Weakness and collapse
    Weak, rapid pulse
    Breathing sounds become dull


Associated with a causative factor:

    Trauma
    Blood clotting (coagulation) disorder


Causes


    Trauma
    Bleeding from any artery or vein of the thoracic wall or spine, damaged heart, lungs, thymus (a small glandular organ that is situated behind the top of the breastbone), and diaphragm
    Rodenticide ingestion is a common cause
    Herniated liver or spleen
    Tumor
    Coagulopathies (clotting disorders)
    Clotting factor defects are more common than platelet abnormalities
    May be congenital or acquired
    Liver failure
    Cholangiohepatitis (inflammation of the gallbladder and bile ducts) with concurrent small bowel disease
    Lung lobe twisting
    Acute thymic hemorrhage in young animals (i.e., thymus: gland at the base of the neck)


  

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a standard blood chemical profile, complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Clotting profiles should be performed on a blood sample to verify for delayed clotting times.

The packed cell volume, hemoglobin and platelet count will be lower than normal. The blood chemical profile may show signs of liver failure (which would cause bleeding into bodily cavities since clotting factors would not be produced).

The fluid in the chest should be sampled and analyzed at a laboratory for a comparison with peripheral blood. Platelets are often found in chest fluid samples.

X-rays are crucial for visualizing the extent of the fluid build-up in the chest, the collapse of lung lobes, and any masses which might be present in the chest cavity. An ultrasound of the chest can reveal a diseased condition with an even greater sensitivity than an x-ray image would.

Treatment

Patients suffering from hemothorax should be treated on an inpatient basis. They must receive fluid therapy to correct their blood loss into the chest cavity. If the cat also has air free (outside the lungs) in the chest cavity, this must be immediately corrected. If the lungs are bruised, ventilator support may be necessary. These patients often also need oxygen therapy, and will need to be kept warm to prevent shock. If the cat's blood sample has a delayed clotting time, then a plasma or blood transfusion may be needed to restore clotting factors or to provide red blood cells for oxygen transport. Severe or recurrent thoracic hemorrhage may require surgical exploration.

Living and Management

While your cat is recovering from hemothorax, it is probably best to avoid giving it any aspirin or other over the counter medications that might decrease clotting. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to treat your cat's underlying condition. If your cat shows signs of a recurrence of hemothorax, notify your veterinarian immediately; surgery may be necessary for correcting recurring cases."," and Types

620,Blood Disorders Related to FeLV Infection in Cats,"Cyclic Hematopoiesis in Cats

Cyclic hematopoiesis is a disorder of the formation of blood cells, which rarely affects cats. When it does occur, reports are related to cats that are infected with the leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, a virus that suppresses the immune system in cats. Cyclic hematopoiesis that has been observed in cats appears to be another possible non-cancerous manifestation of the FeLV infection.

Symptoms and Types


    Signs 	and symptoms of FeLV
    Weakness/lethargy
    Swollen 	lymph nodes
    Loss 	of appetite
    Weight 	loss
    Diarrhea
    Recurrent 	skin infections
    Fever
    Anemia


Causes

This blood disorder is directly related to the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in cats. The FeLV virus is transmitted by other infected cats.

Diagnosis

You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis.

Cyclic hematopoiesis cause formation abnormalities throughout the circulatory system's cell lines, such as in the formation of blood platelets, the cells responsible for clotting; neutrophils, white blood cells that are essential for the destruction of infectious microorganisms; reticulocytes, immature blood cells that occur during the regeneration of blood; and  monocytes, white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow and spleen, and which ingest cellular debris and foreign particles in the blood. If the complete blood count shows an abnormally low number of neutrophils and cyclic variations of other cell lines over several days, along with signs of a feline leukemia virus infection, this will strongly support a diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis.


Treatment

Supportive therapy will include fluid therapy and antibiotics for treating infections. Depending on the stage of the virus, the  hematopoiesis may be brought under control with the medication prednisolone, or with the administration of corticosteroid. Further treatment will be based on how well your cat's immune system is fighting the FeLV infection."," and Types

621,Blood Clot in the Lungs of Cats,"Pulmonary Thromboembolism in Cats

A pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to an important artery that feeds into the cat's lungs. Slow-flowing blood and blood vessel damage, in addition to blood which clots too easily, can predispose a cat to thrombus formation. Most of the time, PTE is caused by another underlying disease.

Pulmonary thromboemboli (blood clots) can originate in the right atrium of the heart, or in many of the major veins throughout the body. As the cat's body makes oxygenated blood to deliver to the heart and lungs, this clump of blood cells is carried through the bloodstream toward the lungs, where it gets caught in a narrow portion of one of the passages of the arterial network that feeds oxygenated blood to the lungs. In this way, the blood flow through that artery is halted, and oxygenated blood is not able to reach the lung. The severity of the condition is, to a degree, dependent on the size of the blood clot.

PTE can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. In most cases, the bloodwork will be necessary for pinpointing an underlying disease.

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues to the clot's origin.

Arterial blood gases will be taken to check for low oxygen in the blood. A coagulation profile will be done to detect a clotting disorder; these tests include the one-stage prothrombin time (OSPT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Heartworm serology will also be performed.

X-ray images of the cat's chest will allow your veterinarian to visually examine your cat for pulmonary artery abnormalities, enlargement of the heart, lung patterns, or fluid in the lungs. Your veterinarian may choose the more sensitive echocardiogram (an ultrasound image of the heart) to see the motion and size of the heart and its surrounding structures more clearly, because a thrombus in the right chamber of the heart, or in the main pulmonary artery, will sometimes show up on an echocardiogram.

  

Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings can indicate cor pulmonale, enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart due to increased blood pressure in the lungs. Serious heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) will be evident on an ECG.

There is also pulmonary angiography, which uses an injection of a radio-contrasting agent into the cat's lung arteries to improve visibility on the X-ray, and spiral computed tomography (CT), which is three-dimensional X-ray imaging for non-selective angiography.

Treatment

Cats with PTE should be hospitalized, primarily for oxygen therapy. If the cat is not receiving enough oxygen to its heart, lungs, or brain, the veterinarian will recommend rest in a caged environment; this is generally due to hypoxemia or syncope. However, the underlying cause of the condition will be treated once your veterinarian has settled on a definitive diagnosis.

Living and Management

Unfortunately, PTE is usually fatal. Cats will often suffer a recurrence of PTE unless the underlying cause of the disease is found and corrected.

Your veterinarian will schedule weekly checkups with the your cat to monitor its blood clotting times, since anticoagulant medications can cause bleeding disorders on the opposite side of the scale. The new low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant medicines are much safer for use, but they are also more expensive.

Close supervision of your pet, and contact with your veterinarian will usually be sufficient, especially since your cat may need to be on anticoagulant medication for several months.

Doctor-approved physical activity, or other physical therapy, may improve blood flow. Your veterinarian will be able to advise you on the appropriate activity for your individual pet's needs. The goal is to prevent future PTE in immobile cats with severe disease."," and Types

622,Blind Quiet Eye in Cats,"If your cat has loss of vision in one or both eyes without ocular vascular injection or other apparent signs of eye inflammation, it may be suffering from Blind Quiet Eye. This disease may occur due to abnormalities in retinal image detection, retinal focusing, optic nerve transmission, or simply the central nervous system's inability to interpret images correctly.



Symptoms and Types



Because Blind Quiet Eye directly affects the cat's vision, it may display several signs, including:




	Clumsy behavior (e.g., bumping into objects, tripping, falling)
	Decreased or absent menace response (i.e., does not blink when a hand is waved toward the eyes)
	Impaired visual placing responses (e.g., extends the paws incorrectly when trying to approach a nearby surface)




In addition, these problems may become more exaggerated when outside at night.



Causes



There are several causes for Blind Quiet Eye, such as cataracts, central nervous system lesions, and the lens' inability to focus correctly. Other common causes include:




	Retinal disorders:
	
		Sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS)
		Shrinking of the retina (progressive retinal atrophy)
		Separation of the eye's inner lining (retinal detachment)
		Ivermectin toxicity
		Taurine deficiency
		Enrofloxacin (an antibiotic) toxicity
	
	





	Optic nerve issues due to:
	
		Inflammation
		Cancer
		Trauma
		Underdevelopment
		Lead Toxicity
	
	


 

Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health and the onset and nature of the symptoms to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination (including an opthalmoscopic exam) as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) to rule out potential systemic causes of the disease.



During the ophthalmic exam a penlight will be used to rule out potential systemic causes of the disease, such as cataracts or retinal detachment. (In cases of retinal detachment, the systemic blood pressure is often elevated.) Ophthalmoscopy, meanwhile, may reveal progressive retinal atrophy or optic nerve disease.



If the ophthalmic exam reveals nothing irregular, it may suggest sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS), retrobulbar optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve after it exits the eye toward the brain), or a central nervous system (CNS) lesion. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, electroretinography -- which measures the electrical responses of photoreceptor cells in the retina -- makes it possible to differentiate retinal from optic nerve or CNS disease. Ocular ultrasounds and CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans are also very helpful to visualize and diagnose orbital or CNS lesions.









Treatment



Your veterinarian will try to localize the disease and will often refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for Blind Quiet Eye brought on by SARDS, progressive retinal atrophy, optic nerve atrophy, or optic nerve hypoplasia. However, cataracts, luxated lenses, and some forms of retinal detachment may be treated surgically.



In addition, cats with retinal detachment should have their exercise severely restricted until the retina is firmly reattached. Those with nutritionally-induced retinopathy, meanwhile, should be fed a diet with sufficient amounts of taurine in it.



Living and Management



With assistance, blind pets can lead relatively normal and functional lives. However, cats with progressive retinal atrophy or genetic cataracts should not be bred. Your veterinarian will recommend you with some basic safety concepts, such as examining for potential hazards in your home. He or she will also schedule regular follow-up exams to ensure that any ocular inflammation is controlled and to ensure, if possible, that your pet’s vision is maintained."," and Types

623,Blepharitis in Cats,"What Is Blepharitis in Cats?
Blepharitis in cats is inflammation of the eyelids. It often occurs simultaneously with inflammation of the pink inner lining of the eyelids (conjunctivitis or “pink eye”). If the eyelids are very swollen, blepharitis may limit the cat’s field of vision.

Blepharitis is very common in cats and most will develop it at some point in their lives. If an infection is causing blepharitis, the infection may be contagious to other cats.

Blepharitis is not typically an emergency unless there is trauma to the eye due to an accident. Blepharitis may cause your cat to paw at their eye, risking injury. Placing an e-collar or recovery cone on your cat until they can see a veterinarian may help reduce self-injury to the eye while you wait for your appointment.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Blepharitis in Cats
Blepharitis itself is a symptom of an underlying cause. The signs of blepharitis in cats include:


	
	Swollen eyelids
	
	
	Redness, scabbing, or crusting of the eyelids
	
	
	Rubbing or pawing at the affected eye(s)
	
	
	Sores or wounds around the eyes
	
	
	Watery or thick, clear to green discharge from the eyes
	
	
	Loss of hair (alopecia) around the eyes
	
	
	Concurrent conjunctivitis
	


Causes of Blepharitis in Cats
There are many causes of blepharitis in cats, including infections or parasitic infestation, allergy, autoimmune issues, congenital or developmental problems, and injury.

Infectious and parasitic causes of blepharitis include:


	
	Ringworm (dermatophytosis)
	
	
	Bacterial infection, such as Staphylococcus
	
	
	Demodex mites or mange
	
	
	Insect or spider bites
	
	
	Fungal infection such as cryptococcosis
	


With sudden allergic reactions triggered by bug bites or medications, the eyelids may swell as part of the initial reaction.

Chronic allergies in cats typically appear as inflammation in the skin rather than hay fever signs seen in humans. Though the eyelids aren’t specifically affected in most cats with chronic allergies, they sometimes swell due to environmental or food allergies.

Autoimmune conditions that can cause blepharitis in cats include pemphigus (an autoimmune disease of the skin) or systemic lupus erythematosus (which can affect many systems in the body).

Congenital or developmental causes include:


	
	Entropion (eyelid rolled in)
	
	
	Ectopic cilia (eyelash disorders)
	


In these cases, eyelid swelling often occurs due to hair or fur irritating the cornea (outer clear layer of the eye), which may cause the cat to rub and paw at their eyes.

Wounds on the eyelid or trauma to the eye region can also cause eyelid swelling. Examples of injuries include a scratch in a cat fight, bites to the head, or blunt trauma to the eye region.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Blepharitis in Cats
The veterinarian can diagnose blepharitis in cats through simple physical examination. Importantly, blepharitis itself is not a disease but rather a symptom of another problem.

To determine what is causing swelling of the eyelids, your veterinarian may perform additional tests including:


	
	Looking into the back of the eye (fundic exam).
	
	
	Staining the eye to look for ulcers.
	
	
	Testing for upper respiratory infections, which usually involves taking a swab of the inside of the eyelids, nose, and/or throat and sending to a laboratory.
	
	
	Sedated examination of the eyelids to check for eyelash abnormalities, masses, or foreign objects under the lids.
	
	
	Cytology or skin scrape of the skin around the eyes, which involves looking under a microscope for infectious organisms or cell abnormalities.
	
	
	Blood tests to check systemic health and rule out feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).
	


To help the veterinarian with the diagnosis, pet parents should discuss:


	
	The cat’s vaccination history
	
	
	How long the signs have been occurring
	
	
	Any trauma to the eye
	
	
	Any other affected animals in the home
	
	
	History of upper respiratory infections
	
	
	Whether the cat tests positive for FeLV or FIV
	


Treatment of Blepharitis in Cats
If an infection is suspected, medications may be prescribed either to go topically within the eye or orally. Examples include:


	
	Doxycycline (oral antibiotic)
	
	
	Azithromycin (oral antibiotic)
	
	
	Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (oral antibiotic)
	
	
	Oxytetracycline and polymyxin B (topical antibiotic)
	
	
	Idoxuridine (topical antiviral)
	
	
	Famciclovir (oral antiviral)
	
	
	Itraconazole (oral antifungal)
	


Do not use triple antibiotic ointments or ocular ointments meant for humans in your cat’s eyes. Your veterinarian will usually recommend topical or oral parasiticides if mange is the cause.

For eyelid abnormalities, surgery may be required. For example, if the eyelids are rolled in (entropion), a procedure will be done to turn the eyelid outward. If there is an abnormal eyelash growing inside the eyelid, the follicle may be frozen (cryosurgery) to prevent regrowth.

Allergic causes of inflamed eyelids will be managed based on what is causing the allergy.

Treatments may include antihistamines, medications such as cyclosporine, immunotherapy (allergy shots), or dietary changes. 

Recovery and Management of Blepharitis in Cats
With treatment, most infectious causes of blepharitis should improve within seven to 14 days.

Infection with ringworm may result in a slower recovery time. Keep in mind that ringworm is contagious to other animals and humans, so use caution when handling your cat. Consider wearing gloves and washing your hands and isolating the sick cat from other pets in the home. Speak with your veterinarian about ways to ensure your home environment is kept clean.

With proper treatment, mange-induced inflammation usually improves within several weeks. Fungal infections such as cryptococcus can be difficult to treat, with treatment sometimes lasting for months.

If your cat had surgery due to an eyelid abnormality, recovery takes about two weeks. Your vet may recommend an e-collar to help aid in the recovery process. It’s absolutely essential that your cat’s e-collar remains in place until your veterinarian clears you to remove it. If your cat can rub at or scratch the eye, they can damage their surgical site.

Some cats with eyelid infections may be predisposed to developing them again, especially if they have an underlying condition that weakens their immune system like FIV.

Keeping your cat on flea and tick preventatives and up to date on their vaccinations can help mitigate the risk of infectious or parasitic blepharitis.

624,Bleeding of the Retina in the Eye in Cats,"Retinal Hemorrhage in Cats



Retinal hemorrhage is a condition of the innermost lining of the eye in which there is a local or generalized area of bleeding into that lining. This inner lining is referred to as the retina. The retina lays just beneath the middle choroid coat, which in turn lies between the retina and the sclera – the white outer lining of the eye (the part of the eye that can be seen). The choroid coat contains connective tissue and blood vessels, which deliver nutrients and oxygen to the outer layers of the retina. In some cases the retina may separate from this layer. This is termed retinal detachment. The causes of retinal hemorrhage are usually genetic and breed specific.



Symptoms and Types




	Vision loss / blindness, demonstrated by bumping into objects
	Bleeding in other body parts – small bruises throughout the body
	Blood in urine, feces
	Whitish-appearing pupil
	Pupil may not contract when bright light is shone in the eyes
	Sometimes, no signs may be observed




Causes



Genetic (present at birth):


	Faulty development of the retina or the lubricating fluids of the eyes (vitreous humor)


Acquired (condition that develops sometime later in life/after birth):


	Trauma/injury
	Generalized (systemic) high blood pressure (hypertension), especially in old cats
	Kidney disease, heart disease
	Increased levels of thyroid hormones
	Increased levels of some steroids
	Exposure to some chemicals, such as paracetemol
	Some fungal and bacterial infections
	Some forms of cancer
	Blood disorders – blood-clotting disorders, anemia, hyperviscosity of blood, etc.
	Diabetes
	Inflammation of blood vessels
	Older cats with high blood pressure may also develop hemorrhage or detachment of the retina




Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, a blood pressure test and a urinalysis, so as to rule out other causes of disease.





The physical exam will entail a full ophthalmic exam using a slit lamp microscope. During this exam, the retina at the back of the eye will be closely observed for abnormalities. The electrical activity of the retina will also be measured. An ultrasound of the eye may also be done if the retina cannot be visualized due to hemorrhaging. Samples of vitreous humor (eye fluid) may be taken for laboratory analysis.





Treatment



Patients with retinal hemorrhage are usually hospitalized and given close care by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications depending on the underlying cause of the disease. Surgery can sometimes be performed to reattach the retina to the choroid coat.



Living and Management



Your veterinarian will schedule frequent follow-up appointments for your cat to chart the deterioration or progress (post-surgically) of the retina and the underlying disease that caused it to detach. Repeat bloodwork and ophthalmic exams will be performed during these visits. If your cat becomes blind as a result of the retinal detachment, remember that once the underlying cause of disease has been controlled, the eye will no longer be painful to your cat. Although the blindness may not be reversed, your cat can still lead a happy and fulfilling life indoors as it learns to compensate with its other senses and memorizes the layout of the home.



As your cat will be more vulnerable without its sight, you will need to take extra care to protect your cat from harmful situations, such as with other pets and active children. Also, you will need to keep your cat indoors at all times.

625,Bleeding Disorder in Cats,"Von Willebrand's Disease in Cats

VWF is an autosomal (non-sex-linked) trait, which both males and females express and transmit genetically and with equal frequency.

Von Willebrand’s disease (vWD) is a blood disease caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), an adhesive glycoprotein in the blood required for normal platelet binding (i.e., clotting) at the sites of small blood vessel injuries. In addition, vWF is a carrier protein for coagulation Factor VIII (necessary for blood to clot). A lack of vWF impairs platelet stickiness and clumping. Similar to hemophilia in humans, this condition can lead to excessive bleeding following an injury, due to the lack of clotting. The expression pattern of the severe forms (Types 2 and 3 vWD) is recessive while the milder form (Type 1 vWD) appears to be recessive or incompletely dominant.

This clotting disorder is rare in cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Spontaneous 	hemorrhage from mucosal surfaces:
    
        Nosebleeds
        Blood 		in the feces (black or bright red blood)
        Bloody 		urine
        Bleeding 		from the gums
        Bleeding 		from the vagina(excessively)
    
    
    Bruising 	of skin
    Prolonged 	bleeding after surgery or trauma
    Blood 	loss anemia if there is prolonged bleeding


Causes


    Hereditary 	vWD is caused by mutations that impair vWF synthesis, release, or 	stability.


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. A blood chemical profile will be performed, with a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. If there has been blood loss, a regenerative anemia will be seen on the complete blood count. Typically, the platelet count will be normal (unless your cat has experienced recent, massive bleeding), and coagulation tests will show normal results.

A clinical diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is based on a specific measurement of plasma vWF concentration bound to the antigen (vWF:Ag). The length of time that it takes for platelets to plug a small injury will be measured, with a test  called the buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT). The BMBT test, along with the platelet function analyzer (PFA 100), are point-of-care screening tests where the endpoints are prolonged in patients with platelet clumping defects and vWF deficiency. Prolongation is nonspecific, and may accompany numerous severe disorders of the blood.

Treatment

Transfusion of fresh whole blood, fresh plasma, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate will supply vWF to the blood.  Component therapy (fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) is best for surgical prophylaxis (prevention) and nonanemic patients, to prevent red cell sensitization and volume overload.  Patients with severe vWD may require repeated transfusion to control or prevent hemorrhage.  If a cat lacking vWF requires surgery, a pre-operative transfusion should be given just before the procedure.

Living and Management

Most cats with mild to moderate vWD will continue to have a good quality of life,  requiring minimal or no special treatment. Cats with more severe forms will require transfusion for surgery, and should be transfused if supportive care fails to control a spontaneous bleeding episode. Most of these cats can be maintained comfortably, but their activities will need to be monitored and limited.  If your cat has von Willebrand Disease and it has an episode of prolonged bleeding, call your veterinarian and take it to a veterinary clinic immediately for emergency treatment."," and Types

626,Blastomycosis in Cats,"What Is Blastomycosis in Cats?
Blastomycosis, sometimes called blasto, is a disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The condition more commonly occurs in dogs, although it also occurs in cats. Blasto primarily affects the lungs of cats, but it can also progress to the brain and spinal cord, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal system.

The fungus is commonly found in soil near wet environments, such as riverbanks, lakes, and swamps, or around decomposing organic matter, such as wooded areas and forests. Many cases of blastomycosis have occurred in the Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Ohio river basins; near the Great Lakes; and in Canada’s Manitoba and Ontario provinces.

Cats can acquire these infections by ingesting or inhaling the blasto organism or by the microbe entering the skin through a wound or cut (it cannot penetrate intact skin). The time between exposure to this organism to when a cat starts to show clinical signs ranges from 5-12 weeks. Blastomycosis is not contagious between animals and people. Unfortunately, it can be fatal to those infected.

Symptoms of Blastomycosis in Cats
The symptoms of blastomycosis vary, depending on which organ system is involved. Below is a list of blasto symptoms, ordered from most to least common in cats.

These symptoms can also be non-specific, meaning they are not directly related to the fungal lesion but are related to a general feeling of illness. It is important to bring your cat to a veterinarian as quickly as possible if they have any signs of blastomycosis.

Causes of Blastomycosis in Cats
The most common way for cats to contract blastomycosis is by ingesting or inhaling the fungal spores, but it can also be transmitted directly into a cat’s circulation through a skin wound. While infectious fungal spores are found only in soil near waterways, both indoor cats and cats with access to the outdoors can be infected, since the spores live and spread in the air.

Once the fungal spores are inhaled or ingested, the warmth of the cat’s body allows the spores to transform into budding yeast. The yeast establishes lesions in the lungs or broken skin, and from there it can spread to the bloodstream and infect other organs. Though fungal infections can cause disease in healthy cats, those with a compromised immune system or those weak or sick with other illnesses commonly become infected more readily. Cats that are provided antibiotic drugs or immunosuppressive agents long-term also appear to be more susceptible to fungal infections.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Blastomycosis in Cats
An important aspect of diagnosing a blasto infection is knowing if your cat frequents the type of place that harbors the fungal organism, so providing your veterinarian with a detailed history of your pet’s activities is crucial.

Your veterinarian will probably do a complete physical examination and order bloodwork (chemistry panel, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel) to assess body function and to rule out other conditions that might cause similar signs. A urine and blood test specifically for blastomycosis is only reliable for dogs, so the diagnosis in cats is generally made through visualization under a microscope of fungal organisms in infected tissues.

If your cat has lesions on the skin or other body organs, a biopsy will be recommended to collect cells or remove a piece of abnormal tissue that will then be tested for the blasto organism. These lesions can be seen during a physical examination as skin abscesses, on radiographs as lung nodules, or on advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI as advanced lung disease or other body systems being affected.

In coughing cats, with or without lung disease evident on initial chest x-rays, an airway wash (tracheal wash or tracheal lavage) is typically ordered. This procedure requires your cat to be heavily sedated so that lung fluid samples can be collected for analysis. It is possible that your vet can see the fungal spores in this analysis, which would confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment of Blastomycosis in Cats
Treatment is highly dependent on how severely affected your cat is. Cats that are having breathing issues or those not eating are more likely to be hospitalized. Treatment for feline blastomycosis consists of a prolonged course of oral antifungal medications. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for both cats and dogs with blasto. Combination therapy with other antifungal medications is sometimes needed for advanced cases or those not responding to itraconazole alone.

If the fungus has infected the respiratory system, your veterinarian will also work to stabilize your cat’s condition and treat any severe symptoms. Supportive care to help with symptoms may include oxygen therapy for those having trouble breathing, IV fluids, anti-inflammatories, appetite stimulants, and liver protectants.

Antifungal medications have the propensity for side effects on the liver and gastrointestinal system. For this reason, it is important that your vet monitor your cat’s liver enzymes and other body functions with routine bloodwork and urine testing during and after treatment.

The prognosis for feline blastomycosis is guarded, but treatment is improving with the availability of newer antifungal medications. Unfortunately, the death rate in cats with severe respiratory infections is high, even after treatment begins.

Recovery and Management of Blastomycosis in Cats
Antifungal medication is given daily for two to six months. Once cats have made it through the first two weeks of treatment, the prognosis for recovery improves. It is critical to give all medications as directed. Working closely with your veterinarian and following all medication instructions will increase your cat’s chance of survival and reduce the likelihood of relapse and returning symptoms.

To know when treatment can be discontinued, routine x-rays of the lungs will likely be done to ensure that the lesions are healing. Medications are usually continued for at least a month after clinical signs have dissipated and lung lesions are no longer visible on x-rays. Relapse can occur in cats with very severe cases of blastomycosis or those in which treatment was stopped too soon.

Prevention of Blastomycosis in Cats

There is no way to prevent blastomycosis except keeping your cat away from areas that have a high risk for fungus, such as riverbanks and decaying organic material. If your cat spends time outside in environments that are damp and wet with minimal sunlight and you see symptoms that may indicate a fungal infection, contact your veterinarian immediately. While there is no vaccine currently available to prevent blastomycosis, studies are ongoing to formulate an effective and safe vaccine against this fungal disease.

627,Birth Difficulties in Cats,"Dystocia in Cats



A difficult experience is medically referred to as dystocia. It may occur as a result of maternal or fetal factors, and can occur during any stage of the labor. Abnormalities of presentation, posture, and the position of the fetus within the uterus can negatively affect the temporal relationship between the birthing offspring and the maternal birth canal.



Uterine inertia (inactivity) may be primary or secondary. Primary inertia is symptomized by a failure of the body to commence synchronous uterine contractions, and secondary inertia is symptomized by a cessation of uterine contractions due to uterine fatigue. This latter condition sometimes occurs when labor has gone on longer than the uterine muscles are capable of meeting the demands for.



There are three stages of labor. The first stage of labor entails the start of uterine contractions, relaxation of the cervix, and rupture of the chorioallantoic sac (water breaking). The female cat (queen) will purr and socialize during the first stage of labor. The purring is thought to be a self-relaxation technique.



The second stage of labor is when the fetuses are pushed out by uterine contractions. In cats the average length of full parturition (delivery) is 16 hours, with a range of 4–42 hours (up to three days in some cases may be normal). It is important to consider this variability before intervening.



The third stage is delivery of the fetal membranes. The female cat may alternate between stage two and three with multiple fetuses being delivered. She may deliver one or two fetuses followed by one or two fetal membranes, or she may deliver a fetus followed by its accompanying fetal membrane.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of dystocia:


	More than 30 minutes of persistent, strong, abdominal contractions without expulsion of offspring
	More than four hours from the onset of stage two to delivery of first offspring
	More than two hours between delivery of offspring
	Failure to commence labor within 24 hours of the drop in rectal temperature - below 99° F (37.2° C) (Note that drop in rectal temperature is not always consistent)
	Female cries, displays signs of pain, and constantly licks the vulvar area when contracting
	Prolonged gestation – more than 68 days from the day of mating (See Breeding, Timing)
	Presence of bloody discharge prior to delivery of first offspring or between fetuses
	Diminished or absent Ferguson reflex (stimulation or pressure to the dorsal [upper] vaginal wall to elicit abdominal straining [feathering]); the lack of this response indicates uterine inertia




Causes



Fetal


	Oversize fetus
	Abnormal presentation, position, or posture of fetus in the birth canal
	Fetal death




Maternal


	Poor uterine contractions
	Ineffective abdominal press
	Inflammation of the uterus (usually caused by infection)
	Pregnancy toxemia (blood poisoning), gestational diabetes
	Abnormal pelvic canal from previous pelvic injury, abnormal conformation, or pelvic immaturity
	Congenitally small pelvis
	Abnormality of the vaginal vault
	Abnormality of the vulvar opening
	Insufficient cervical dilation
	Lack of adequate lubrication
	Uterine torsion
	Uterine rupture
	Uterine cancer, cysts or adhesions (due to previous inflammation)




Predisposing Factors to Dystocia


	Age
	Brachycephalic (short-headed) and toy breeds
	Persian and Himalayan breeds
	Obesity
	Abrupt changes in environment before cat goes into labor
	Previous history of dystocia






Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including any information you have about your cat's lineage, and details of any past pregnancies or reproductive problems. Your veterinarian will palpate (examine by touch) your cat's vaginal canal and cervix.



Your veterinarian will take samples for testing; at the minimum, a packed cell volume (PCV), a total protein, a BUN (blood urea nitrogen), a blood glucose, and a calcium concentration measurement. Your cat's blood progesterone levels will also be measured.



X-rays are crucial for determining the approximate number, size and location of the fetuses. X-rays may also show if the fetuses are still alive, but an ultrasound can give even more subtle measurements, such as indications of fetal stress, assessing placental separation, and the character of the fetal fluids.





Treatment



Cats that are in distress and have been diagnosed with dystocia should be treated on an inpatient basis until all of the offspring have been delivered and until the mother has stabilized. If uterine contractions are absent and there is no evidence of fetal stress, medical treatment will be initiated. Your cat's condition may be due to low blood sugar, low levels of blood calcium, inadequate oxytocin production by the body or an inadequate response to normal oxytocin production.



Agents used to promote uterine contractions should not be administered when obstructive dystocia is possible, as they may accelerate placental separation and fetal death, or may cause uterine rupture. Oxytocin, glucose and calcium can be supplemented as needed.



Manual delivery may be necessary to deliver a fetus that is lodged in the vaginal vault.

Your veterinarian will use digital manipulation to reposition the kitten, since this method provides the least amount of damage to the kitten and mother cat. If the vaginal vault is too small for digital manipulations, instruments, such as a spay hook or non-ratcheted forceps, may be used to assist in delivery. Throughout the process, your veterinarian will use adequate lubrication, always placing a finger in the vaginal vault to direct the instrument and always taking great care to protect the lives of both mother and kittens. With queens the use of instruments is not normally recommended because of the small size of the vaginal vault.



Extreme caution should be used under these circumstances. Undesirable complications include mutilation of the fetus and laceration of the vaginal canal or uterus. Traction should never be applied to the limbs of a live fetus. If there is a failure to deliver the fetus within 30 minutes a Cesarean section is indicated.



Living and Management



If your cat is a breed predisposed to dystocia, or if your cat has a personal or familial history of dystocia, ask your veterinarian about the possibility of scheduling an elective cesarean section before your cat can go into labor. It must be timed as precisely as possible to ensure the health of the mother and kittens. If you suspect early in labor that your cat is suffering from dystocia, contact your veterinarian immediately so as to prevent further complications in the lives of the mother and kittens.

628,Bilious Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) in Cats,"What Is Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats?
Cats can vomit for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the reason is  serious, such as underlying organ dysfunction. Other times, cats may vomit due to more simple problems, like hairballs. And when cats throw up yellow liquid, they may be vomiting bile or stomach acid.

Bile is a substance that is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It is greenish in color and helps with digestion, secreted in the small intestine to break down food.

When bile builds up it can back up into the stomach, which irritates the stomach lining. Cats can vomit up bile or stomach acid when their stomach has been empty for prolonged periods.

Usually, if a cat vomits yellow liquid it is due to some underlying cause, whether a primary gastrointestinal issue or because another system in their body is not functioning properly. Rarely, cats will vomit because of bilious vomiting syndrome (BVS).

BVS is a common condition in dogs, but it is rarely seen in cats. It’s characterized by vomiting up stomach acid or bile, usually overnight or first thing in the morning when a cat’s stomach has been empty for a while.

While BVS is not considered a medical emergency, vomiting can be. Cats with this condition may vomit first thing in the morning, but they act normally otherwise.

These cats eat, drink, and play as usual. This chronic condition can look very similar to persistent vomiting that is seen with many other diseases, so it’s important to talk to your veterinarian.

If your cat is not eating, weak, lethargic, or vomiting several times in an hour (protracted vomiting), seek veterinary care right away.

Symptoms of Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
Symptoms of BVS in cats include:


	
	Vomiting up yellow or green liquid
	



	
	Vomiting first thing in the morning before eating
	
	
	Appetite changes
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Abdominal pain
	
	
	Nausea
	


Causes of Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
While the exact cause of BVS in cats is unknown, it’s believed to be the result of a motility (pace of food movement) issue with the GI tract.

The duodenum is the first segment of the small intestine. When it’s irritated (sometimes by parasites like Giardia or from chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it can lead to reflux. IBD is a condition that leads to thickening of a cat’s intestines. The thickened bowel does not have the good motility as a normal bowel, which can result in delayed emptying of the colon and reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach. 

Duodenal reflux is the movement of intestinal contents backward into the stomach, rather than forward down the GI tract. When the bile enters the stomach, it causes irritation to the lining. This causes a cat to vomit bile.

BVS is typically seen in cats with concurrent diseases like IBD.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
BVS is usually more of a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning your vet will want to rule out more common illnesses before diagnosing your cat with this condition.

While your vet will start with a physical exam and history, they will likely want to run bloodwork, do a urinalysis, and take X-rays to look for any abnormalities.

For a cat experiencing weight loss or chronic vomiting, a vet may test for feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and thyroid issues. They may also recommend an abdominal ultrasound.

Other causes of chronic, intermittent vomiting that your vet will want to rule out include:


	
	Kidney disease
	
	
	Liver disease
	
	
	Hyperthyroidism
	
	
	Inflammatory bowel disease
	
	
	Parasites
	
	
	Dietary food intolerances
	


Be sure to tell your vet when the vomiting episodes started and what frequency they are occurring. It’s helpful if you can keep a log of what time of day they vomit and what the vomit looks like. For example, is it always yellow-green, or does it sometimes contain undigested food?

Treatment of Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
Bilious vomiting syndrome can’t be cured. However, it can typically be managed by feeding a cat smaller meal more frequently.

Pets that have this condition often vomit in the morning after a long fast, having not eaten since an early dinner the previous day. Feeding a snack right before bed can be helpful in stimulating your cat’s GI tract to digest the meal and help propel stomach contents forward. Prescription diets may be recommended by your vet.

BVS may be managed with medications. Acid reducers can help minimize irritation of a cat’s stomach that occurs when bile backs up. Famotidine, an over-the-counter antacid, is often prescribed.

Additionally, some cats may benefit from a pro-motility medication, like metoclopramide or cisapride, to aid in normal digestion.

If your cat developed BVS secondary to another underlying cause, your vet may prescribe additional medications to treat those conditions.

Recovery and Management of Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
Management of BVS is usually centered around promoting good motility of the stomach and intestines. This motility can be stimulated by feeding small meals more frequently. Feeding small meals three to six times per day can reduce the amount of time your cat has an empty stomach.

Remember, if you are adding in a late-night snack or small meals midday, be sure to reduce the total quantity fed during normal mealtimes.

Make sure that the total amount of food fed is the same; just split up into smaller portions throughout the day. Avoid overfeeding your cat too many calories, as obesity can lead to many issues down the road.

Sometimes prescription diets are recommended in cats that vomit frequently. Your veterinarian may recommend a trial of a highly digestible diet like Hills® i/d Digestive Care, Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal, or Purina® EN Gastroenteric. Some cats may benefit from a hypoallergenic or novel protein diet like Hills® z/d or Royal Canin® Selected Protein.

Occasionally, switching to a canned food diet can be helpful in promoting quicker stomach emptying, as dry food takes longer to move out of the stomach.

Prevention of Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats
While there is no way to prevent BVS, you can reduce your cat’s risk of developing this condition.

Preventing the stomach from being empty for long periods of time by feeding smaller, more frequent meals may reduce your cat’s risk of struggling with bilious vomiting syndrome.
Bilious Vomiting Syndrome in Cats FAQs How do you know if vomit is bilious? “Bilious” means that the vomit contains bile. Bile is greenish yellow in color. Vomit that contains bile usually has a greenish or dark yellow color.
Is bilious vomiting syndrome serious? Bilious vomiting syndrome itself is not very serious. However, if a cat develops aspiration pneumonia secondary to vomiting, that can be serious.

629,Bile Duct Cancer in Cats,"Cholangiocellular Carcinoma in Cats
 
Bile duct carcinomas are an aggressive form of cancer, with metastasis occurring in 67 to 88 percent of affected animals. They are historically difficult to completely remove by surgical means. 
 
This malignant cancer typically arises from the the epithelia, the cellular lining of the hepatic (liver) bile ducts, and occurs more often in the intrahepatic bile ducts (within the liver) rather than in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver). Complications of this disease include a failure of the bile to pass through the bile ducts due to the mass of tissue that is blocking the duct, and metastasis to the lungs, lymph nodes of the liver and peritoneum (abdominal lining). 
 
Because of carcinoma's tendency to metastasize widely, it can also spread to other regional lymph nodes, like the diaphragm (the thin muscular wall dividing the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity), intestines, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, and the bone. This is classified as a particularly malignant form of cancer, therefore, animals with this disease usually have a guarded to poor prognosis.
 
Bile duct carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer that is found to affect cats. While its incidence does not appear to be related to breed, it has been found to be more common in female cats, and in cats that are ten years of age or older. 
 
Symptoms and Types

Often, cats with bile duct cancer will have a round or swollen abdomen, which can be due to an enlarged liver or fluid in the abdomen. Other common symptoms associated with the disease include:




    Lack of appetite
    Lack of energy
    Excess need to urinate and drink
    Vomiting
    Yellow-skin and/or yellow whites of eyes (as a result of bile dysfunction)

 
Causes
 

    Possibly due to      parasitic infestations
    Suspected      relation to environmental exposure to carcinogens

 
Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you provide, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition (such as exposure to toxins). Following the initial exam, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. From these your veterinarian will check for elevated liver enzymes, the confirmation of which is indicative of an inflamed or damaged liver that has spilled enzymes into the bloodstream. A coagulation profile will also be ordered to test whether your cat's blood is clotting properly. 
 
X-rays to visualize the abdomen and liver will be taken to localize the carcinoma. An abdominal ultrasound will also be needed to observe the texture and size of the liver and surrounding abdominal organs. If your veterinarian suspects cancer, the lungs will need to be examined using X-ray imaging, since this type if carcinoma is know to have a high rate of metastasis, commonly affecting the lungs and lymph nodes. 
 
If cancer is suspected, it will be necessary for your veterinarian to perform a liver biopsy in order to confirm it. The sample can often be taken by fine needle aspiration, but in some circumstances, a doctor may need a larger tissue sample and will need to perform a simple surgery to collect it. This can be done using a laparoscope, a tubular diagnostic tool that is equipped with a camera and forceps for collecting tissue, and which is inserted through a small surgical incision in the abdominal cavity. The tissue sample taken will be sent for laboratory analysis. 
 
Similarly, if your cat has fluid in its abdomen, your veterinarian will draw some out to be sent to the lab for analysis. Pending the results of these tests, your veterinarian will treat your cat's symptoms as necessary. 
 
 
Treatment
 
Surgery to remove the liver cancer is the treatment of choice. Up to 75 percent of the liver can be removed if the remaining liver tissue is normal. Chemotherapy is generally not indicated, as it has not been found to be a successful treatment in cats. Even with successful surgery and little to no metastasis throughout the body, prognosis remains poor. 
 
Living and Management
 
You will need to return to you veterinarian for follow-up exams every two months after the initial care. Your doctor will measure liver enzyme activity in the blood stream, and check the status of your cat's liver and organs using thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound."," and Types

630,Basal Cell Tumor in Cats,"What Is a Basal Cell Tumor in Cats?
A cat’s skin, or epidermis, is made up of several layers. The bottom layer contains basal cells, which are responsible for producing new skin cells. A basal cell tumor is an abnormal growth and proliferation of these cells, their associated hair follicles, or sweat glands. Basal cell tumors are the most common type of skin tumor for cats, occurring in about 25% of all cases.

Although extremely rare, malignant basal cell tumors, also called carcinomas, grow in the area where the tumor is located and spread, or metastasize, elsewhere in the body.

Fortunately, most basal cell tumors in cats are benign, do not spread, and are easy to remove.

Symptoms of Basal Cell Tumors in Cats
Because basal cell tumors occur on the skin, the most noticeable sign will be a growth somewhere on your cat’s body. They can occur anywhere, but have a higher tendency to be found on the head, neck, back, or feet.

They often appear like a single, firm, hairless, sometimes ulcerated mass that may arise from a stalk or be freely moveable. Although they vary in size, they are often small, usually less than a few centimeters in diameter. In cats, they can range in color from gray to black. They can also at times be filled with fluid.

Causes of Basal Cell Tumors in Cats
Basal cell tumors are an abnormal and uncontrolled growth of basal cells. In humans, there is a correlation between UV light (sun damage) and the development of basal cell tumors, and this relationship is suspected in cats as well, but has not been confirmed.

Many factors, from chemical and toxin exposure to genetics, have been considered, especially since the tumors occur more commonly in older cats and in domestic medium- and long-hair breeds such as Persians, Angoras, and Himalayans.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Basal Cell Tumors in Cats
A physical exam is performed to locate a basal cell tumor and to determine its size and the extent of surgery required for removal. Your veterinarian may want to perform an FNAC (fine-needle aspiration cytology) of the mass. A small sample of the tumor is collected with a needle, then submitted for analysis. The test, generally non-invasive and minimally uncomfortable, is often performed bedside in the clinic.

If FNAC results are inconclusive, your veterinarian may elect to remove a piece of the tumor (biopsy) to send out for analysis or to remove the entire tumor, which should also be sent for analysis to ensure its complete removal and confirmation of basal cell tumor. 

Prior to any anesthesia and surgery, your veterinarian may recommend a blood profile to review the cat’s kidney and liver function. 

Treatment of Basal Cell Tumors in Cats
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the entire tumor, then microscopic examination of the tissue for diagnosis. Successful removal of the tumor with clean margins almost always results in a good long-term prognosis.

For smaller tumors, cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen is used to freeze off the tumor) may be an option. Some pet parents may elect not to have a benign tumor removed. In that case, you will need to monitor the tumor and report any changes in size or appearance to your veterinarian.

Recovery and Management of Basal Cell Tumors in Cats
Fortunately, basal cell tumors rarely metastasize to other organs. Once surgically removed, they have an extremely rare incidence of growing back. So the prognosis is usually excellent! However, malignant tumors can be locally aggressive and may require more extensive surgery for the same type of prognosis.

As smaller masses are easier to remove surgically and have less inherent risk of complications, consult with your veterinarian at the first sign of any type of growth on your pet. 

Once released from the clinic, your cat will most likely be feeling like their normal self in no time; however, expect a few weeks for a full recovery and getting back to their normal routine, as sutures require some time before they can be removed. Fortunately, just because your cat develops one basal cell tumor doesn’t mean they will develop more in the future.

631,Baldness and Hormone-Related Skin Disorders in Cats,"Hormone Responsive Dermatosis and Alopecia in Cats

Two skin and hair disorders related to an imbalance of reproductive hormones are alopecia and dermatosis. More specifically, alopecia is characterized by a loss of hair leading to baldness, and dermatosis is characterized by a diseased condition of the skin. There are tests to positively identify the conditions, and the cause behind the skin and hair reactions, but there are a lot of reasons for why a cat would have these types of reactions. If all other indications point to an imbalance in hormones related to reproductive functioning, your veterinarian will try supplemental therapy to either increase or decrease hormone levels to a normal amount. Identification of alopecia and/or dermatosis is assured when the conditions spontaneously resolve after your cat has been given reproductive hormone therapy.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms:

    Soft, 	or dry brittle fur
    Secondary 	dandruff
    Itching
    Darkening 	of the skin
    Blackheads 	on the skin
    Abnormal 	nipples, mammary glands, vulva, prepuce (foreskin of  the penis or 	clitoris), testicles, ovaries and prostate gland
    Secondary  	bacterial infection
    Inflammation 	of the outer ear with  wax build-up
    Wetting 	the floor

Types:

    Alopecia 	(Early stage hair loss)

        Stomach
        Thighs

    Alopecia 	(Later stage hair loss)
    
        Rump
        Flank
    
    


Causes

Affected cats are categorized, and treated, according to the measurable amount of reproductive hormones being produced in the body:

Estrogen-responsive - ovarian imbalance II in females - rare

    Adrenal 	gland reproductive hormones are below normal levels
    Occurs 	after spaying in non-cycling, intact females
    Occasionally 	seen during false pregnancy


Too much estrogen - ovarian imbalance I in females - rare

    Occurs 	due to cystic ovaries, ovarian tumors (rare), or from estrogen 	overdose (from medicine administered to the cat by a caregiver)


Too much androgen (male reproductive hormone) - associated with testicular tumors in non-neutered males

    Androgen-producing 	testicular tumors
    Idiopathic 	(unknown) male feminizing syndrome (male animal takes on female 	behavior)


Testosterone-responsive - old castrated males - rare

    Low 	androgen levels suspected


Castration-responsive - intact males with normal, descended testicles

    Onset 	is at one to four years or older


Adrenal reproductive hormone imbalance - adrenal hyperplasia–like syndrome (enlargement of tissue)

    Adrenal 	enzyme (21-hydroxylase) deficiency resulting in excessive adrenal 	androgen (male reproductive hormone), or progesterone secretion 	(female reproductive hormone)
    Affects 	males and females, intact or neutered
    Onset 	is one to five years of age




Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Serum sex hormone tests will often show as normal in these cats. A skin biopsy (tissue sample) can illustrate abnormal sex hormone receptors in the skin.

X-ray, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy (using a small camera to examine the interior of the abdomen) imaging can be used for detection of ovarian abnormalities, testicular disorders and cancer.

An adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, and an adrenal reproductive hormone test may be performed to measure the functional capability of the adrenal gland, and to be sure that it is specifically producing reproductive hormones. A Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) response test can demonstrate the response of the cells in the testes and ovaries to gonadotropin hormones. Specifically, the hormones that produce testosterone, primarily.

Treatment

If your cat is suffering from abnormal reproductive hormone levels, neutering or spaying will be one of the primary treatments. This alone may be enough to resolve the skin disorders. If your cat is on estrogen therapy, and the results are adverse to the health of your cat, your veterinarian will discontinue it. Your veterinarian will prescribe topical medicine, or prescription shampoo for dandruff, bacterial skin infections, and itching.

Living and Management

Do not breed your male cat if it is affected with cryptorchidism (undescended testicles). It is highly advised that all cats suspected of suffering from sex hormone related skin disorders should be spayed or neutered.  Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary for further treatment of any underlying sex-hormone related causes of the skin disease."," and Types

632,Bad Breath in Cats,"What Is Bad Breath in Cats?
Is your cat’s breath unusually bad? The medical term for bad breath is halitosis, and it can be caused by several factors, such as dental disease, kidney disease, or diabetes. The most common cause is a buildup of bacteria on the surface of the teeth, leading to periodontal disease.

Plaque is a sticky substance that is made up of saliva and leftover food particles. It sticks to the surface of your cat's teeth and gives bacteria a place to grow.

Over time, that bacteria-laden plaque hardens into tartar, which can irritate the mouth leading to red swollen gums (gingivitis). It may also cause inflammation of the surrounding tissue like the inner surface of the cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof of the mouth, a condition called stomatitis. Besides causing stinky breath, it may be painful for the cat.

Halitosis is a common condition in cats and is not considered a medical emergency.

Symptoms of Bad Breath in Cats
Symptoms of bad breath in cats may include:


	
	Smelly saliva
	
	
	Excessive drooling
	
	
	Red, sore gums
	
	
	Dark yellow, brown, or green material on the surface of the teeth
	
	
	Decreased appetite or difficulty chewing
	


Causes of Bad Breath in Cats
The most common cause of bad breath in cats is tartar buildup and the periodontal disease that follows when it gets underneath the gum line. The tartar that forms on teeth can hurt the surrounding tissues, like the gums and inner surfaces of the cheeks, lips, and roof of the mouth.

An overgrowth of bad bacteria then occurs in the mouth, which leads to decay. Decaying tissue surrounding the teeth gives off a smelly sulfuric scent that contributes to bad breath. This can progress to rotten teeth and mouth pain.

Other causes include:


	
	Getting things stuck in between the teeth or under the gum line, like string or food.
	
	
	Oral ulcers, whether from an underlying virus like feline calicivirus or uremic ulcers from kidney disease.
	
	
	Uncontrolled diabetes, which can create compounds called ketones that cause a sickly-sweet smelling breath.
	
	
	Mouth cancer, which can also lead to dead or decaying tissue.
	


Any cat of any age or breed can have halitosis. Dental tartar and the resulting bad breath can affect all cats, but it is less common in very young cats who have not had time to build up much tartar.

Feline juvenile gingivitis-periodontitis, where cats are affected by dental disease at an early age, is more commonly in Siamese, Maine Coon, and Somali breeds.

Kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer are all more common in middle-aged to senior cats.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Bad Breath in Cats
If you notice bad breath in your cat, call your veterinarian. During the appointment, they will start with a thorough oral exam. If they are unable to check the entire mouth due to your cat’s stress level or pain, they may recommend sedation to help them see in the back of the mouth.

Let your vet know if your cat is not eating well or if you are seeing them do any strange movements with their jaw or tongue.

If your cat does not have any signs of dental disease as the primary cause of their bad breath, your vet may recommend more diagnostics, like blood work.

Treatment of Bad Breath in Cats
Bad breath is treated by addressing the underlying cause.

If the cause of your cat’s halitosis is dental disease, your veterinarian will clean the teeth and remove any that are rotten. The cleaning is done by putting your cat under anesthesia and using a special tool called an ultrasonic scaler to remove stubborn tartar and to clean around and under the gums.

They will also polish the teeth to smooth any microscopic scratches on their surface. This helps to slow the buildup of future plaque and tartar.

Antibiotics or pain medications may be prescribed.

If other underlying diseases are found, they will be treated by your vet.

Recovery and Management of Bad Breath in Cats
Recovery following a dental procedure is typically smooth. If your cat had any teeth removed, they may be put on a soft food diet for 10 to 14 days while their gums are healing. This means feeding either canned food exclusively or softening dry food by watering it down and allowing it to soak for 10 minutes before feeding.

If your cat had stitches following any teeth removals, you may see some pawing at the mouth if the stitching material is bothering them. For these cats, a recovery cone may be helpful to protect the gums while they heal.

Prevention of Bad Breath in Cats
Bad breath is best prevented with a good oral health care routine. If your cat will tolerate teeth brushing, that’s the best place to start.

It’s easier to make brushing part of your cat’s daily life. Start with a little bit of feline toothpaste on your finger and rub it on the outer surface of your cat’s teeth. Afterward, give your feline friend a special treat that they love. If they do OK with this, you can work up to using a soft pet tooth brush or finger toothbrush.

633,Bacterial Skin Infections (Pyoderma) in Cats,"What Are Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats?
A major function of the skin is to act as a protective barrier against infection. If this barrier is damaged and breached, bacteria can colonize and cause infection.

Bacterial skin infections in cats may be referred to as pyoderma. Both phrases relate to disease of the skin caused by germs. In medical terminology, the prefix “pyo-” means “pus” and the suffix “-derma” refers to the “skin,” forming the definition “pus in the skin.” Bacterial infections of the skin may be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that normally live on the skin (normal flora) or by bacteria temporarily or not normally found on the skin. Cats develop pyoderma less commonly than dogs do.

If a skin infection is not treated appropriately, the infection can migrate deeper into tissues, causing worsening signs and further discomfort.

Types of Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats

Bacterial infections may be located on the surface of the cat’s skin, extend superficially into the outer layer of the skin (epidermis), or migrate into the deeper layers of the skin (dermis and subcutis).


	
	Surface: Infection rests on the surface of the skin and may include hot spots, skin fold irritation, and skin redness due to an overgrowth of bacteria.
	
	
	Superficial: The infection extends deeper than the skin’s surface into the epidermis and hair follicles. This is commonly caused by Staphylococcus bacteria.
	
	
	Deep: This type of infection occurs less commonly, but it is more harmful because it extends into the dermis and can lead to cellulitis or introduce bacteria into the blood. If infections are persistent and do not heal, there may be an underlying immune dysfunction such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or an atypical mycobacteria infection.
	

Symptoms of Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats
Signs of bacterial skin infection in a cat may include:


	
	Excessive scale or dander, especially on the lower back near the tail
	
	
	Crusts
	
	
	Small, firm bumps on the skin (miliary dermatitis)
	
	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Redness
	
	
	Open sores or ulcers
	
	
	Blood and discharge from sores
	
	
	Skin odor
	
	
	Scratching, licking, or rubbing the skin (itchiness)
	

Causes of Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats
Bacterial skin infection in cats can be caused by an underlying condition such as allergies, external parasites like fleas, Demodex, or feline chin acne. Areas on the cat’s body that are warm and trap moisture (skin folds) host the perfect conditions for bacteria that can lead to irritation and infection.

Diseases affecting the cat’s immune system such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can cause an overgrowth of bacteria since a cat’s natural defenses are suppressed.

Injuries such as scratches or bite wounds that compromise the protective function of the skin can allow bacteria to colonize and cause infection, which may progress to an abscess. Endocrine disorders including hyperthyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease) can affect the skin, potentially leading to infection. Inadequate grooming can leave the skin greasy and dirty and cause matting of the hair, which can also irritate the skin.

The most common bacterial strains include:


	
	Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (usually found on the skin)
	
	
	Pasteurella multocida (commonly found in the cat’s mouth and saliva)
	

How Veterinarians Diagnose Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats
Diagnosing a bacterial skin infection is based on the cat’s history, clinical signs, diagnostic testing, and ruling out other diseases and disorders.

The following diagnostic options may be recommended:


	
	Skin cytology—Your vet may take samples from the skin lesions and observe them under a microscope to confirm presence or absence of bacteria or white blood cells
	
	
	Skin scraping—Skin scrapings are taken to look for mites. This is accomplished by scraping the cat’s skin with a sterile scalpel blade deep enough to cause irritation or some mild bleeding to ensure any mites are included in the sample (Demodex lives deep in the hair follicles)
	
	
	Wood’s lamp—Any yellow-green fluorescence observed by lamp may indicate a fungal infection, like ringworm
	
	
	Trichogram—Plucked hairs can be examined under a microscope to look for any fungal spores or mites
	
	
	Fungal culture—May also be taken to look for fungal growth to help diagnose the cat’s skin condition
	
	
	Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing—This will tell the veterinarian what type of bacteria is present and provide direction on the best medication(s) for treatment, especially if the infection is recurrent or does not heal
	

Treatment of Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats
Successful treatment of a bacterial skin infection is based on the results of the diagnostic testing. 

The most common bacterial skin infection in cats is caused by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. The most effective systemic antibiotics for treating this type of infection include:


	
	Clindamycin
	
	
	Cephalexin
	
	
	Clavamox®
	
	
	Trimethoprim sulfa
	


Topical medications include shampoos, creams, gels, ointments, sprays, wipes, and mousses. These products can be effective for superficial or mild skin infections and the active ingredients can be effective in eliminating bacterial infections. Recommended products include:


	
	TrizCHLOR® wipes
	
	
	Vetoquinol BPO-3™ Shampoo
	
	
	Douxo S3 PYO Antiseptic Antifungal Chlorhexidine Dog & Cat Shampoo
	
	
	Davis Benzoyl Peroxide Dog & Cat Creme Rinse
	
	
	Pet MD Antiseptic & Antifungal Medicated Spray
	
	
	Ethyl lactate (10%)
	
	
	Sodium hypochlorite (0.005%)
	

Recovery and Management of Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats
Bacterial skin infections take time to heal, and directions from your veterinarian should be followed precisely. Give the antibiotics exactly as prescribed and make sure your cat finishes all of them. Antibiotics may need to be given daily for three or more weeks. Severe infections may need 8-12 weeks of antibiotic therapy to heal. Superficial infections may be treated until all clinical signs resolve, and then be continued for an extra 7-10 days.

A recurrent or non-healing infection often has an underlying problem that has not been identified and is not being treated correctly. Other reasons an infection hasn’t healed include the antibiotics being stopped too early, the wrong medication being prescribed, or an incorrect dose being used.

Cats with pyoderma may benefit from having their hair clipped, especially long-coated cats. This helps with grooming by removing hair that may trap bacteria, dirt, dead skin cells, and oil. Regular grooming is recommended to help prevent matting of the hair, and it also helps identify any issues before they become a big problem.
Bacterial Skin Infections in Cats FAQsWhat do bacterial skin infections in cats look like?Cats with a bacterial skin infection may have excessive dander and scale, crusts, red and irritated skin, open and draining wounds, pus, hair loss, bumpy skin, or itchiness.
Are bacterial skin infections in cats contagious to humans?Yes, it is possible that some bacterial infections can be contagious to humans, especially for people who have a weakened immune system. One example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The best way to prevent infection is to maintain hygiene by washing your hands with soap and warm water after interacting with your cat and after cleaning the litter box, and by covering any open wounds on your skin.

634,Bacterial Infection (Tyzzer Disease) in Cats,"Tyzzer disease is a life-threatening bacterial infection. It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium piliformis, which is thought to multiply in the intestines and once reaching the liver, causing severe damage. Young cats are at high risk of developing the disease.

Symptoms and Types

Due to the severity of the liver damage, some cats with Tyzzer disease may die within 24-48 hours. Some early signs of the disease include:


    Lethargy
    Depression
    Loss of appetite
    Diarrhea
    Abdominal pain and discomfort
    Liver enlargement
    Abdominal distension
    Low body temperature


Causes

The bacterium Clostridium piliformis.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your cat. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your cat and severity of the disease.

If your cat has Tyzzer disease, the biochemistry profile testing may reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, especially shortly before the cat's condition becomes dire.


Treatment

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for Tyzzer disease. Consult with your veterinarian if there is anything that can be done to alleviate your cat's pain."," and Types

635,Bacterial Infection (Streptococcus) in Cats,"Streptococcal Infection in Cats



Streptococcal infection, common in cats, refers to an infection with the Streptococcus bacteria. Kittens and older cats are most susceptible to developing this disease, as their immune systems are not fully developed or have declined.



The condition described in this medical article is common in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.



Symptoms



Some of the common symptoms of this infection include:




	Pain
	Fever
	Arthritis
	Lethargy
	Coughing
	Pneumonia
	Abscess(es)
	Difficulty swallowing due to swelling (tonsillitis)




Causes



Age often determines the propensity for developing this bacterial infection. Both the oldest and youngest cats have less developed immune systems -- the youngest because of the lack of antibodies to fight infection, and the oldest because of a decline in antibodies and a weakened immune system.



Some of the causes for infection are viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, often resulting from recent exposure through a wound or surgical procedure.





Treatment



Antibiotics and hydration will be part of the prescribed treatment.



Living and Management



Good nursing care is important to help the cat recover from this bacterial infection. Rehydration is also important for restoring the body with fluid and flushing the system of the infection.



Prevention



Avoid environments overcrowded with other animals. Other than avoidance of contact with other animals, there are no known preventative measures for this bacterial infection.","

636,Bacterial Infection (Nocardiosis) in Cats,"Nocardiosis in Cats

Both dogs and cats may become exposed to the infectious, saphrophytic organism, which nourishes itself from dead or decaying matter in the soil. Also referred to as Nocardiosis, it is an uncommon infectious disease that affects several body systems, including the respiratory, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Typically, exposure occurs either through open wounds or via inhalation.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of nocardiosis are largely dependent on the site of infection. If, for example, it occurs in the pleural body cavity, which includes the lungs and surrounding membranes, symptoms can include emaciation, fever, and raspy, labored breathing (dyspnea). If it is a skin infection, symptoms can include the presence of chronic non-healing wounds and, if left untreated, draining lymph nodes. If the infection is not localized in one specific area of the body (also known as disseminated), the symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and lethargic behavior.

Causes

The infectious organism is found in the soil and can enter the cat's body through open wounds or through the respiratory tract, when it inhales. Nocardia asteroides is the most common species affecting cats. Cats are also susceptible to Nocardia brasiliensis and Proactinomyces spp.
 
Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will analyze cells from the cat's thorax or abdomen to identify the causative organism. Other diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and urine analysis, are employed to rule out other potential causes, including fungal infections and tumors.



Treatment

Treatment for nocardiosis is largely dependent upon the site of infection and subsequent symptoms. If pleural effusion is apparent, hospitalization will be necessary to prevent dehydration. Surgical drainage of the fluid may even be required. Otherwise, long-term antibiotic therapy is vital for fighting off the infection.

Living and Management

Because nocardiosis frequently affects the musculoskeletal and central nervous system, it is imperative that you carefully monitor the cat for fever, weight loss, seizures, breathing difficulties, and lameness for at least one year after therapy.

Prevention

General cleanliness and frequent disinfection of your cat's wounds or cuts may help prevent this type of infection, especially if your cat has a weakened immune system."," and Types

637,"Bacterial Infection (Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Acoleplasma) in Cats","Mycoplasmosis in Cats



Mycoplasma, acholeplasma, and t-mycoplasma or ureaplasma are three types of a class of anaerobic bacterial parasitic microorganisms that act as infectious agents to the body. Mycoplasmosis is the general medical name given to a disease caused by one of these agents. These bacteria are capable of living and growing even without the presence of oxygen (anaerobic), and are able to self produce.



Mycoplasma lack a true cell wall, making them capable of assuming a variety of shapes, and capable of spreading into different systems throughout the body, from the respiratory tract, where they can cause pneumonia, to the urinary tract, where they can result in various forms of diseased conditions. These bacteria are believed to be the smallest organisms capable of growing independently, and they remain ubiquitous in nature; they are found in nearly every environment, causing disease not only in animals, but also in people, plants, and insects.



Symptoms and Types



Symptoms of mycoplasmosis includes simultaneous inflammation of several joints (known as polyarthritis), such as the knees, ankles, hips, or shoulders, and inflammation of tendon sheaths. Long-term lameness, difficulty moving, fever, and general signs of discomfort are some of the typical signs. Other signs may include squinting or spasmodic blinking, fluid-buildup in the eyes, reddened eyes, discharge from the eyes, or conjunctivitis, a condition in which the moist tissue of the eye becomes inflamed. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild, with sneezing being the main complaint.



In cats, further signs related to the site of infection may include long term abscesses on the surface of the body/skin. Infections in the respiratory system, or urinary and genital tract infections, are also common. Feline pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, are some of the conditions that may be present. Because of the genital to reproductive system proximity of this bacterial parasite, pregnancy related problems are a common finding. Weak newborns, stillbirths, early death of newborns, or death while in embryo are some of the more severe repercussions.



Causes



Mycoplasmosis is caused by exposure to a number of commonplace bacteria that can be found throughout the environment. Some of the bacteria that cause mycoplasmosis in cats include M. felis, M. gateae, and M. feliminutum.



Factors that may increase the risk of developing mycoplasmosis include an immunodeficiency disorder that prevents the immune system from functioning properly, as well as other issues that may affect the immune system, such as tumors.





Diagnosis



Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.



There are various diagnostic procedures that may be undertaken if the symptoms of mycoplasmosis are present. An analysis of the fluid secreted into the prostate can reveal if normal bacterial cultures are present. The presence of mycoplasmosis will be concurrent with inflammatory cells. If polyarthritis is suspected, an analysis of the synovial fluid, the fluid found in the cavities of certain joints (e.g., knees, shoulders), may be useful. Increased levels of nondegenerative neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are usually found in this case.





Treatment



Mycoplasmosis is treated on an outpatient basis, meaning it does not require hospitalization and can be treated at home. Depending on the severity and localization of the condition, antibiotics may be prescribed in order to address the infection.



Living and Management

 

Treatment at home generally must continue for an extended period of time. Your veterinarian can specifically prescribe the appropriate antibiotic treatment and specify the necessary length of treatment based on an examination of the symptoms. It is important to regularly administer any antibiotic treatment for the full period of time as advised by your veterinarian.



Cats with healthy immune systems that are given proper treatment with antibiotics have a good prognosis and are expected to recover fully.

 

Prevention



There are no known vaccines available to prevent infection by the bacteria which cause mycoplasmosis, thus there is little that can be done to prevent infection. The bacteria causing mycoplasmosis may be killed by drying out (for example, via sunshine) as well as chemical disinfection. Your veterinarian can guide you in the selection of products that will work in your environment. General cleanliness and avoidance of extended exposure to moisture may be helpful."," and Types

"
638,Bacterial Infection (Metritis) of the Uterus in Cats,"Metritis in Cats

Metritis, a uterine infection that usually occurs within a week after a cat gives birth, is symptomized by an inflammation of the endometrium (lining) of the uterus due to a bacterial infection. It can also develop after a natural or medical abortion, miscarriage, or after a non-sterile artificial insemination. The bacteria that are most often responsible for infection of the uterus are gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, which often spreads into the blood, causing a blood infection. The infection may lead to sterility, and if left untreated, septic shock, a lethal condition, may follow.

Symptoms and Types


    Discharge 	from the vulva that smells bad; discharge with pus, or pus mixed 	with blood; discharge that is dark green
    Swollen, 	dough-like abdomen
    Dehydration 	(the skin stays tented for a few seconds when pinched)
    Dark 	red gums
    Fever
    Reduced 	milk production
    Depression
    Lack 	of appetite
    Neglect 	of kittens
    Increased 	heart rate if the bacterial infection has become systemic


Causes


    Difficult 	birth
    Prolonged 	delivery, perhaps with a large litter
    Obstetric 	manipulation
    Retained 	fetuses or placentas
    Natural 	or medical abortion, miscarriage
    Natural 	or artificial insemination (rare)


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will help your veterinarian to determine whether the bacterial infection has spread to the bloodstream, where the infection might have originated, and how dehydrated your cat is. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition.

Diagnostic tools, like radiograph and ultrasound imaging, will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the interior of the uterus for any retained fetuses or birth matter, excess fluid accumulation, and/or abnormal amounts of abdominal fluid production due to uterine rupture.



A sample of the vaginal discharge will also be taken for cytologic (microscopic) examination. A culture of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that lives with oxygen, or without oxygen, respectively) will be used for identifying the bacterial populations present in the blood, and a sensitivity of the isolated bacteria will be performed so that the most appropriate antibiotic treatments can be prescribed.

Treatment

Your cat will need to be hospitalized for fluid therapy, and for correction and stabilization of any electrolyte imbalances. If the infection has reached sepsis, your cat will also be treated for shock. Your cat will also need to be placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics until the bacterial culture and sensitivity results return from the lab; then, depending on the results, your veterinarian may switch your pet to the antibiotic best suited for eliminating the bacteria that are causing the infection.

If the metritis is not in an advanced stage, your cat will most likely respond to medical treatment. However, medical treatment does not always prevent the infection from progressing to a generalized abdominal infection and ruptured uterus. If future breeding is not planned, having your cat spayed is the treatment of choice. This solution is especially appropriate when retained fetuses or placentas are present in the uterus, when the uterus has ruptured, or when it is severely infected. Patients suffering from a long-term infection that is not responding to medical treatment may improve with a surgical cleaning of the uterus.

Living and Management

If your cat is nursing and has been diagnosed with a bacterial blood infection, it will be better to hand-raise her kittens so that transmission of the infection through her milk can be prevented. This can also prevent possible harm to the kittens from exposure to the prescribed antibiotics in their mother's bloodstream. Keep in mind that even without spaying, animals that have been treated for a uterine infection have a chance of becoming less fertile, or even infertile, making future breeding difficult or impossible."," and Types

639,Bacterial Infection (Leptospirosis) in Cats,"Leptospirosis in Cats

Leptospirosis is an infection of bacterial spirochetes, which cats acquire when subspecies of the Leptospira interrogans penetrate the skin and spread through the body by way of the bloodstream. Two of of the most commonly seen members of this subspecies are the L. grippotyphosa and L. Pomona bacteria. Spirochetes are spiral or corkscrew-shaped bacteria which infiltrate the system by burrowing into the skin.

Leptospires spread throughout the entire body, reproducing in the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, eyes, and reproductive system. Soon after the initial infection, fever and bacterial infection of the blood develop, but these symptoms soon resolve with the reactive increase of antibodies, which clear the spirochetes from most of the system. The extent to which this bacteria affects the organs will depend on your cat's immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully. Even then, Leptospira spirochetes can remain in the kidneys and continue to reproduce there. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal when the infection progresses, leading to severe organ damage. Young cats with less developed immune systems are at heightened risk for severe complications, as well as cats with already compromised immune systems.

The Leptospira spirochete bacteria is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted from an infected animal to humans and other animals. Children are most at risk of acquiring this parasitic bacteria from an infected pet.

Causes

The Leptospira spirochete infection occurs mainly in subtropical, tropical, and wet environments. Leptospira spirochetes are most prevalent in marshy/muddy areas with  stagnant surface water. Heavily irrigated pastures are also common sources of infection. The infection rate for domestic pets has been increasing in the U.S. And Canada, with infections occurring most commonly in the fall season. Cats typically come into contact with the leptospira bacteria in infected soil or mud, from drinking or being in contaminated water, or from coming into contact with urine from an infected animal. This last method of contact might take place in the wild. Cats that live near wooded areas, or cats that live on or near farms are at a higher risk of contracting the bacteria. Also at increased risk are cats that have spent time around other animals, as in kennels. Otherwise, because most cat breeds do not spend a lot of time near water, infection of the Leptospira spirochete is rare in cats.

  

Diagnosis

Because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, your veterinarian will be especially cautious when handling your cat, and will strongly advise you to do the same. Protective latex gloves must be worn at all times, and all body fluids will be treated as biologically hazardous materials. Urine, semen, post-abortion or birth discharge, vomit, and any fluid that leaves the body will need to be handled with extreme caution.

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, recent activities, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what stage of infection your cat is experiencing, and which organs are being most affected.

Your veterinarian will then order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, an electrolyte panel, and a fluorescent antibody urine test. Urine and blood cultures will also be ordered for examining the prevalence of the bacteria. A microscopic agglutination test, or titer test, will be performed to measure your cat's immune response to the infection by measuring the presence of antibodies in the bloodstream. This will help to definitively identify Leptospira spirochetes and the level of systemic infection that is occurring.

Treatment

Your cat will need to be hospitalized if it is severely ill from this infection. Fluid therapy will be the primary treatment for reversing any effects of dehydration. If your cat has been vomiting, an anti-vomiting drug, called an antiemetic, may be administered, and a gastric tube can be used to give nourishment if your cat's ability to eat or keep food down is being hindered by the illness. A blood transfusion may also be necessary if your cat has been severely hemorrhaging.

Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian for a course of at least four weeks, with the type of antibiotic dependent on the stage of infection. Penicillins can be used for initial infections, but they are not effective for eliminating the bacteria once it has reached the carrier stage. Tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, or similar antibiotics will be prescribed for the carrier stage, since they are better distributed into the bone tissue.  Some antibiotics can have side effects that appear serious, especially those drugs that go deeper into the system to eliminate infection. Be sure to read all of the warnings that come with the prescription, and talk to your veterinarian about adverse indications you will need to watch for. Prognosis for recovery is generally positive, barring severe organ damage.

Living and Management

A vaccination for the prevention of the leptospirosis infection is available in some areas. Your veterinarian can advise you on the availability and usefulness of this vaccine. Make sure to inspect kennels before placing your cat in one – the kennel should be kept very clean, and should be free of rodents (look for rodent droppings). Urine from an infected animal should not come into contact with any other animals, or people. Animals that are kept in close quarters are going to be in contact with other animals' urine, even under the best circumstances, so cleanliness needs to be the utmost consideration when choosing your kennel.

Activity should be restricted to cage rest while your cat recovers from the physical trauma of this infection. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, transmissible to humans, and other animals via urine, semen, and post-abortion discharge. While your pet is in the process of being treated, you will need to keep it isolated from children and other pets, and you will need to wear protective latex gloves when handling your pet in any way, or when handling fluid or waste products from your pet. Areas where your pet has urinated, vomited, or has possibly left any other type of fluid should be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly with iodine-based disinfectants or bleach solutions. Gloves should be worn during the cleaning process and disposed of properly afterwards.

Finally, if you do have other pets or children in the home, they may have been infected with the leptospira bacteria and are not yet showing symptoms. It may be worthwhile to have them (and yourself) tested for the presence of the bacteria. It is also important to keep in mind that leptospires may continue to be shed through the urine for several weeks after treatment and apparent recovery from the infection. Appropriate handling practices are the best way to prevent the spread of infection or reinfection."," and Types

640,Bacterial Infection (Campylobacteriosis) in Cats,"Campylobacteriosis in Cats

 

Campylobacteriosis is not commonly found in cats, but when it does occur, it is most likely to affect kittens younger than six months old. The bacteria which causes the disease can typically be found in the gut (gastrointestinal tract) of most healthy mammals, and will remain harmless for most.

 

Up to 45 percent of stray cats carry the campylobacter bacteria. The bacterium is shed through the feces, where other animals may come into contact with it, contracting the bacteria into their own bodies. Because of this, humans can also contract the disease if they do not practice proper hygiene after coming into contact with an infected animal.

 

Symptoms

 


	Fever
	Vomiting
	Tenesmus
	Anorexia
	Lymphadenitis


 

Causes

 

There are several known causes, but the most common way that a cat comes into contact with campylobacter bacteria is from kennels, which may allow animals to come into direct contact with contaminated feces. Ingestion of contaminated food or water is another mode of transmission. In addition, younger animals are at a greater risk for contracting the disease because of their underdeveloped immune systems and natural tendency to explore their environments.

 

Diagnosis

 

A fecal culture is the most common diagnostic procedure. After 48 hours, your veterinarian will examine the culture to look for leukocytes (fecal white blood cells) in the stool, the presence of which is an indication of infection; leukocytes may also be found in your cat's gastrointestinal tract, confirming the presence of campylobacter in the body. complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis.

 





Treatment

 

For mild cases, outpatient treatment is generally recommended. Meanwhile, if your cat has a severe case of campylobacteriosis it will require close monitoring to prevent further complications. Your veterinarian may recommend isolating your cat so that it is not infectious to others, and so that it can recover fully. Administering an oral fluid therapy to treat or prevent dehydration, as well as administration of antibiotics, will be part of the plan for eradicating the infection. In more severe cases, a plasma transfusion may also be necessary.

 

Living and Management

 

While your cat is under treatment and recovering, it is important that you keep it hydrated and watch for any signs of a worsening condition. You will also need to revisit your veterinarian for follow-up treatments to ensure that the bacteria have been entirely removed.

 

Prevention

 

Cleaning your cat's living and eating areas, and routinely disinfecting its water and food bowls are good ways to prevent this type of bacterial infection.

641,Bacterial Infection (B. bronchiseptica) in Cats,"Bordetellosis in Cats

Bordetellosis is a contagious bacterial disease of cats that primarily causes upper respiratory tract abnormalities. Easily spread in kennels, bordetellosis is most severe in young kittens (less than six weeks old) and in kittens living in less than ideal hygienic conditions. However, any cat with a pre-existing airway disease (e.g., feline herpesvirus and calicivirus infections) is susceptible to Bordetellosis, no matter how old it is. 

Symptoms and Types

Carrier cats can seem healthy or have even mild symptoms, but others many have serious complications. Common symptoms associated with Bordetellosis many display untoward symptoms such as:


    Fever
    Lethargy
    Sneezing
    Nasal discharge
    Loss of appetite (anorexia)
    Difficulty breathing
    Crackling lung sounds, moist cough, or (less frequently) wheezing
    Swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck (under the jaw)


Causes

This disease is caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica, a small, aerobic gram-negative (stains purple on slides) coccobacillus.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel.

If severe pneumonia is present, the complete blood count will show an abnormally elevated number of neutrophils with a “left shift,” or an increase in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils. Swab specimens taken from the back of the cat's throat (oropharynx) can also be used to confirm a B. bronchiseptica infection. To identify the sensitivity of the bacteria, meanwhile, an endotracheal wash or tracheobronchial lavage via bronchoscopy can be performed. This, too, will assist the veterinarian in developing an effective treatment plan.



Treatment

Cats with Bordetellosis should be allowed to rest comfortable in a quiet place, away from other pets and active children, for at least two to three weeks or until their lungs appear normal in X-Rays -- especially those that have developed pneumonia. In addition, antimicrobial medication and fluid therapy will be administered.

Living and Management

Cats with uncomplicated infections should begin to recover within two weeks. If the cat does not improve, contact your veterinarian to reevaluate your pet. Cats with severe infections, on the other hand, may require regular follow-up examinations to assess its lungs. 

In addition, cats with bordetellosis may shed the bacteria for at least 19 weeks after initial infection, so be sure to isolate your animal from other cats.

Prevention

The best way to prevent this type of infection is to vaccinate your cat against Bordetella."," and Types

642,Bacterial Infection (Actinomycosis) in Cats,"Actinomycosis in Cats

This infectious disease is caused by a gram positive, pleomorphic (can change shape somewhat between a rod and coccus), rod-shaped bacteria of the genus Actinomyces, most commonly the A. viscosus species. Able to survive with little (microaerophilic) or no oxygen (anaerobic), Actinomyces is rarely found as the single bacterial agent in a lesion. It more often a component of a polymicrobial infection with several bacteria present. In fact, there may even be synergism between Actinomyces and other organisms.

Symptoms and Types


    Pain 	and fever
    Infections 	on the face or neck area; usually localized but may be spread out
    Skin 	swellings or abscesses with draining tracts; sometimes yellow 	granules
    Inflammation 	of the cellular tissue behind the peritoneum, the smooth membrane  	which lines the abdomen (retroperitonitis)
    Inflammation 	of the bone or vertebrae (osteomyelitis), especially long bones such 	as those found in the limbs; this is secondary to the skin infection
    When 	associated with spinal cord compression, motor and sensory deficits 	(i.e., trouble walking, touching, etc.)


Causes

Actinomycosis is thought to occur as an opportunistic infection; i.e., Actinomyces spp. is a normal inhabitant of the cat's mouths, but cuts, scrapes, or bite wounds in the mucosa or skin can cause an imbalance in the bacterial microenvironment. Other risk factors include  periodontal disease and immunosuppressive disorders.

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel. X-rays of cats with actinomycosis will typically demonstrate periosteal (outer layer of bone) new bone production, reactive osteosclerosis (hardening of bone), and osteolysis (dissolution of bone).

For a more definitive diagnosis your veterinarian will submit a specimen of pus or osteolytic bone fragments for culturing. Gram staining, cytology, and acid-fast staining may also be employed.

Treatment

The cat's abscesses will be drained and lavaged for several days. In some cases, a penrose drain will be utilized, whereby a soft rubber tube is placed in the affected area to prevent fluid buildup. Depending on the severity of the infection, your veterinarian may also need to debride (cut open and/or remove tissue) or remove bone, which will require surgery.

Many veterinarians recommend the administration of antibiotics for a minimum of three to four months after the resolution of all signs. This will assist in fighting against other commonly associated microbes.

Living and Management

Observe the affected area for signs of infection and contact a veterinarian if the following signs are noted: itching, swelling, redness and/or draining. Otherwise, your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your pet closely for recurrence.  Redevelopment of infection at the initial site should be expected in about half of the cases."," and Types

643,Babesiosis in Cats,"What Is Babesiosis in Cats?
Babesiosis, previously called piroplasmosis, is a blood-borne parasite transmitted through the bite of a tick. It can affect a wide variety of animals, including humans. Specifically, Babesia felis is the protozoan parasite that affects cats. Though it can often have deadly consequences, this disease is fortunately not as common in the United States (though it is more prevalent where ticks are in abundance). It is seen more predominately in Southern Africa and other countries.

The parasite is ingested by a tick during its feeding stage and replicates within it. If it is inside a female carrying eggs, it will go on to affect the eggs. When the tick latches on and bites the cat, it will pour out (regurgitate) digestive enzymes to prevent the cat’s blood from clotting so it can continue feeding. It is during this regurgitation process that the disease is transmitted to the cat.

Once inside the cat’s bloodstream, the parasites attach to the red blood cells, replicate, and later rupture the cells. They then continue to infect other cells. Anemia (blood loss) usually develops within a few weeks, which can manifest as a lack of energy and appetite, and other serious and life-threatening complications. Of the cases reported, most infections seem to occur in younger cats. There doesn’t seem to be any specific breed or gender that is affected more than another.

Symptoms of Babesiosis in Cats
Tick-borne diseases are usually noticed within a few weeks after the original tick bite. You may notice your cat experiencing the following:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	
	
	Anemia and secondary bruising, which may be noticed as pale gums, bloody stool, and/or a bloody nose
	
	
	Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums)
	
	
	Fever (not as commonly reported)
	


In addition to the above symptoms, you may notice irritation, redness, and itching around the bite site.

Because babesiosis is transmitted through tick bites, be sure to check your cat thoroughly for ticks that are visible to the naked eye; usually the size of a tack or smaller, often darker in color, and have several pairs of legs. The most common areas ticks are found on a cat include the head, ears, neck, feet, and rear.  

Causes of Babesiosis in Cats
Cats acquire babesiosis most frequently through tick bites. Babesiosis has been found in multiple vertebrate species, including humans. Fortunately, it is not a zoonotic disease, meaning you cannot acquire the disease from your cat. Because it is a blood-borne parasite, it can be transmitted to other cats through bites, scratches, and even blood transfusions.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Babesiosis in Cats
Your veterinarian will conduct a physical exam and review the type and consistency of tick preventive given, if any. It is crucial to communicate to your veterinarian any previous tick bites and/or tick sightings in the environment, and discuss any recent travel outside of the United States, prior blood transfusions, and any recent bite wounds. Following this, your vet may also recommend the following:


	
	Bloodwork (specifically a complete blood cell count), urine testing, and X-rays to assess your cat’s overall condition and to rule out other possibilities.
	
	
	Microscopic review of a blood smear, often done by a veterinary clinical pathologist, to look for the pear-shaped organisms seen within the blood cells themselves.
	
	
	PCR or antibody testing aimed at detecting the organism’s DNA.
	
	
	Analysis of the tick itself, if recovered and brought in.
	


Treatment of Babesiosis in Cats
Primaquine phosphate, an anti-malarial drug, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of babesiosis. Antiprotozoal medications, such as imidocarb dipropionate, have also been used.

Depending on the severity of the infection and clinical signs noted, supportive care may be needed. This may include pain medications, blood transfusions, IV fluids, and appetite stimulants. If your cat requires a blood transfusion, it is extremely important to check its blood type first. Unfortunately, there is not a babesiosis vaccine approved for use on cats at this time.

Recovery and Management of Babesiosis in Cats
The timeline of recovery for a cat is dependent on the case. It often takes several doses of the medication—given multiple weeks apart— for full recovery to take place. PCR testing is often recommended as a follow-up to figure out the level and degree of infection and carrier status (if there was no previous infection). Most cats, if treated early during infection, will live normal and healthy lives.

If left untreated, your cat can experience complications, usually related to the anemia, but other complications can develop such as kidney disease, respiratory distress, and liver issues. For cats who recover, even though they can often remain asymptomatic, they will remain carriers of the disease for life, which means there may need to be some continual monitoring and considerations as other cats could become infected.

Prevention of Babesiosis in Cats

Preventing ticks on your cat is relatively effortless. There are many available and cost-effective products on the market that can be used to prevent fleas and ticks on cats. Be sure to partner with your veterinarian to find the product most suitable for you and your pet. Most products take several hours before they start killing and repelling ticks, so be mindful when planning outdoor activities. Ticks have been found throughout the United States and abroad, and it is recommended that you provide year-round protection and perform frequent, thorough checks for ticks on your cat.

644,Ataxia in Cats (Loss of Balance in Cats),"What Is Ataxia in Cats? 
Ataxia is the word used to describe a loss of coordination and balance that affects your cat’s head, limbs, and/or torso. Ataxia is caused by decreased sensory function of the nervous system, which in turn can be caused by a wide range of diseases.  

There are three main types of ataxia in cats:  


	
	Vestibular: The vestibular system, located in the inner ear and brainstem, maintains balance and a sense of “up and down.” Vestibular ataxia usually leads to a head tilt, leaning, falling, and rolling, as affected cats cannot get their bearings. Cats with central vestibular ataxia, meaning the brain stem is affected, often are extremely drowsy or sedate. 
	



	
	Sensory (spinal or proprioceptive): Sensory ataxia is typically caused by lesions in the spinal cord, especially spinal cord compression. This leads to the cat not knowing where his feet are in space, which may cause knuckling of toes, crossing of legs, etc.  
	



	
	Cerebellar: The cerebellum is the part of the brain that helps control fine motor movement and motor strength. Cerebellar ataxia results in uncoordinated movement of the limbs, torso, and head. Cats with cerebellar ataxia generally have a wide stance and exaggerated, large steps. They may have head and/or body tremors and swaying of the torso.

Symptoms of Ataxia in Cats
An ataxic cat may look like they are drunk, with a wobbly gait, swaying, and increased drowsiness. They may also have more subtle symptoms, such as a mild head tilt or a curling under of the toes while walking.  

Cats suffering from ataxia may also have an abnormal eye movement called nystagmus, which is caused by an underlying issue with the central nervous system.  

Cats that suddenly become ataxic often roll or fall to one side and have significant nausea due to feeling so unsteady. Cats with chronic ataxia have generally adjusted over time and are less likely to be nauseated. 

Causes of Ataxia in Cats
There is a long list of possible causes of ataxia, depending on whether the condition is vestibular, sensory, or cerebellar. Sometimes a cause cannot be determined even with extensive testing, but it is very important to rule out as many causes as possible so your vet can create a treatment plan. 

Causes of vestibular ataxia in cats include:  


	
	Infection, especially feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or fungal infection 
	
	
	Inflammatory/immune-mediated causes 
	



	
	Toxicity 
	
	
	Middle or inner ear infection 
	
	
	Metabolic 
	
	
	Cancer, polyp, or tumor 
	
	
	Trauma  
	



	
	Idiopathic (unknown cause) vestibular disease 
	


Causes of sensory ataxia in cats:  


	
	Degeneration (breaking down) of the spinal cords and nerves over time 
	
	
	Loss of blood flow to an area of the spinal cord because of a stroke-like event, or a bleeding blood vessel causing a buildup of blood to compress the spinal cord 
	
	
	Birth defects causing the spine or vertebrae to be malformed  
	



	
	Compression/damage to the spinal cord caused by a tumor, a pocket of infection (abscess), or trauma, which can lead to swelling and bleeding in the spinal canal 
	


Causes of cerebellar ataxia in cats:  


	
	Degeneration (breaking down) of cerebellar tissues 
	
	
	Inflammation, often due to unknown causes 
	
	
	Thiamine deficiency was a common cause of ataxia, until the introduction of modern, balanced commercial cat food; however, as more cats are fed non-commercial diets without veterinary supervision, thiamine deficiency is once again increasing  
	



	
	Structural changes such as underdevelopment or malformation of the cerebellum, most often seen when the mother cat was infected with panleukopenia virus while the kitten was forming in utero (cerebellar hypoplasia). 
	
	
	Brain tumor 
	
	
	Infection or inflammation in the brain 
	
	
	Metronidazole toxicity caused by high-dose administration of this antibiotic 
	


Miscellaneous causes of ataxia in cats:  


	
	Anemia (low red blood cell count) 
	
	
	Issues with oxygen getting to the brain associated with cardiac or respiratory disease  
	
	
	Electrolyte disturbances 
	
	
	Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) 
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Ataxia in Cats
If you notice signs of ataxia in your cat, it’s important to see your vet immediately. Your veterinarian will take a thorough medical history and then perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate for neurological (nervous system) abnormalities.  

Once the type of ataxia (sensory, vestibular, or cerebellar) is identified, additional testing such as blood work, a urinalysis, radiographs, and advanced imaging are likely necessary to determine the cause. 

Treatment for Ataxia in Cats
Treatment is dependent on the cause of the ataxia. For example, if infection is determined to be the cause, specific antibiotics may be prescribed.  

Idiopathic ataxia, or ataxia without a known cause, will be treated with supportive care such as anti-nausea medications, and the cat should be kept in a safe, padded environment where they cannot hurt themselves while showing symptoms. Assisted feeding and IV fluids may be necessary if your cat isn’t able to eat or drink well.  

Some types of ataxia cannot be cured, and supportive care may be recommended to maintain quality of life.  

On the other hand, idiopathic ataxia may resolve on its own and never recur.  

Cats that have been affected since birth may not need any treatment as they have developed with the lack of coordination and balance. However, their environments should be made safe so they cannot fall from any height or become injured.  
Ataxia in Cats FAQsHow long does cat ataxia last? The length of cat ataxia depends on the cause. If caused by something treatable, it may only last for a few days until treatment starts working (for example, an inner ear infection). If a cat is born with cerebellar hypoplasia causing ataxia, it will be a life-long condition. Idiopathic ataxia may improve over several days. Close monitoring is vital to make sure your cat is improving and not worsening.
Can ataxia in cats be cured?Whether ataxia can be cured is dependent on the cause. If the ataxia is secondary to something like infection, toxicity, or a tumor, it may be curable. Idiopathic ataxia may clear up on its own. Some types of ataxia cannot be treated. Once your veterinarian has identified the cause of your cat’s ataxia, they should be able to give you more information about their outlook.  
How is ataxia diagnosed in cats?Ataxia is diagnosed via thorough physical and neurological examination by your vet.

An ataxic cat may look like they are drunk, with a wobbly gait, swaying, and increased drowsiness. They may also have more subtle symptoms, such as a mild head tilt or a curling under of the toes while walking.  

Cats suffering from ataxia may also have an abnormal eye movement called nystagmus, which is caused by an underlying issue with the central nervous system.  

Cats that suddenly become ataxic often roll or fall to one side and have significant nausea due to feeling so unsteady. Cats with chronic ataxia have generally adjusted over time and are less likely to be nauseated. 

Causes of Ataxia in Cats
There is a long list of possible causes of ataxia, depending on whether the condition is vestibular, sensory, or cerebellar. Sometimes a cause cannot be determined even with extensive testing, but it is very important to rule out as many causes as possible so your vet can create a treatment plan. 

Causes of vestibular ataxia in cats include:  


	
	Infection, especially feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or fungal infection 
	
	
	Inflammatory/immune-mediated causes 
	



	
	Toxicity 
	
	
	Middle or inner ear infection 
	
	
	Metabolic 
	
	
	Cancer, polyp, or tumor 
	
	
	Trauma  
	



	
	Idiopathic (unknown cause) vestibular disease 
	


Causes of sensory ataxia in cats:  


	
	Degeneration (breaking down) of the spinal cords and nerves over time 
	
	
	Loss of blood flow to an area of the spinal cord because of a stroke-like event, or a bleeding blood vessel causing a buildup of blood to compress the spinal cord 
	
	
	Birth defects causing the spine or vertebrae to be malformed  
	



	
	Compression/damage to the spinal cord caused by a tumor, a pocket of infection (abscess), or trauma, which can lead to swelling and bleeding in the spinal canal

645,Aspirin Poisoning in Cats,"Image via iStock.com/MilanEXPO

Updated on February 25, 2019

Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, has been found to have beneficial effects for some animals. It has been used for conditions related to blood clotting and inflammation, and for its analgesic (pain-relieving) properties. However, aspirin for cats can actually be toxic.

Aspirin should only be given to cats under strict veterinary supervision. On its own, aspirin can be toxic to cats. In combination with other medications, the effects of aspirin can be more rapid.

Once ingested, aspirin forms salicylic acid, which is then distributed throughout the body. Aspirin toxicity is a particular concern in cats because they lack the enzyme critical for metabolizing salicylic acid properly.

Cat owners must follow their veterinarian's orders strictly if cat aspirin is prescribed for any reason.

Symptoms and Types of Cat Aspirin Toxicity

The progression of symptoms can occur quickly. Frequently, one of the first noticeable signs is loss of appetite.

Other signs of aspirin toxicity in cats include vomiting and diarrhea, brought on by ulceration in the stomach and small intestines. The vomit or diarrhea may have fresh blood (red) or digested blood (dark brown to black) in it.

The central nervous system may also be affected, causing your cat to have trouble walking, appear weak and uncoordinated, or even collapse. Loss of consciousness and sudden death can also occur.

Even dosed at the appropriate amount, aspirin for cats can produce these symptoms, therefore it is imperative for you to monitor your cat for any digestive problems or changes in behavior when giving aspirin that is prescribed by a veterinarian.

If a significant amount of aspirin is ingested, emergency medical treatment will be necessary.

Diagnosis

If you know, or even suspect that your cat has ingested aspirin, and your cat is showing apparent symptoms of toxicity, contact an emergency veterinarian immediately.

Diagnostic tests should focus on determining the severity of the toxicity. A blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis.

Often an affected cat will be anemic (low red blood cell volume) with electrolyte abnormalities, in addition to showing a reduction in the blood's ability to clot properly. Aspirin reduces blood flow to the kidneys, which can cause or worsen existing kidney disease.

Treatment

Cats treated within 12 hours of ingestion, and who are presenting limited signs of distress, can have the concentration of aspirin in the body decreased through a prescribed treatment of decontamination. The sooner this care begins, the better.

Your veterinarian may recommend that you decrease the amount of aspirin in the body by inducing vomiting at home before coming to the clinic, or the vomiting may be induced in the clinic.

By inducing vomiting, or pumping the stomach (gastric lavage), your veterinarian will be able to remove as much aspirin as possible, which will help with lowering the chances of permanent injury.

Activated charcoal may be given after vomiting to absorb some of the remaining aspirin.

Depending on your cat's status, fluids and other supportive treatments may be necessary. Hospitalization and repeated blood analysis will often be standard until your cat is stable.

Prescription pet medications to encourage healing, or to protect the gastrointestinal lining, are also generally prescribed both in the clinic and for a period of time after returning home.

Living and Management

Aspirin for cats has several clinical uses. It can be prescribed as a pain reliever, an anti-inflammatory and an anti-blood clotting agent. It can also be used for lowering an abnormal body temperature.

Regardless of why your cat is being prescribed aspirin, it is important to follow your veterinarian’s directions precisely. This includes the type of tablet because certain kinds of coating may increase the risk of toxicity in your cat.

Reducing or discontinuing the aspirin dosage may be necessary if your pet is showing a susceptibility to toxicity."," and Types of Cat Aspirin Toxicity

646,Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats,"What Is Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats?
The lungs function the same in cats as they do in humans; they remove used air (carbon dioxide) and supply the body with fresh oxygen in a process called ventilation. The lungs also transfer oxygen directly into the bloodstream to nourish tissues. 



Pneumonia occurs when the transfer of oxygen is disrupted. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when a cat accidentally breathes in a substance that inhibits that transfer. Lack of oxygen for any reason can very quickly progress to severe illness, so if a cat shows any symptoms of aspiration pneumonia it is important to have them seen immediately by a veterinarian.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats
Symptoms can occur quickly or develop slowly. The progression of symptoms will greatly depend on the severity of the aspiration. Some of the signs and symptoms include: 


	
	Increased breathing rate
	
	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Lack of appetite
	
	
	Green or yellow nasal discharge
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Respiratory distress
	
	
	Open-mouth breathing
	


Causes of Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats
Aspiration pneumonia is most commonly caused by accidentally inhaling vomit or contents from the stomach. Stomach acid can cause inflammation in the airways and often contains bacteria, which can lead to infection in the lung tissue, which then results in pneumonia. 

Other risks or causes include:


	
	Throat or esophageal disorders (megaesophagus)
	
	
	Anesthesia, which can cause vomiting
	
	
	Muscle disorders (myasthenia gravis)
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Oral cavity defects (such as cleft palate)
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats
A history of vomiting, one or more of the clinical signs listed above, and a physical exam may lead your veterinarian to suspect aspiration pneumonia. Your cat’s breathing may also sound harsh when your veterinarian listens to their lungs. 

Tests your veterinarian may recommend include:


	
	Radiographs (x-rays) of the chest are the primary tool in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia; they will give your veterinarian a picture of how the lungs are functioning. Depending on the severity of your cat’s symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend additional testing.
	
	
	A chemistry/complete blood count is a blood test that checks red and white blood cell levels, glucose level, electrolytes, and organ function. This may be done in the hospital but may also need to be sent out to a laboratory. Results in cats with aspiration pneumonia will often show elevated levels of white blood cells and low red blood cell counts.
	
	
	An upper respiratory panel is a specialized test in which a swab is taken of the upper airway to test for viruses and bacteria.
	
	
	A culture may be taken from your cat’s trachea and/or nasal passage to determine what kind of bacteria is present and which antibiotics would be best to treat the infection.
	


Treatment of Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats
Treatment will generally consist of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Based on their symptoms your cat may need to be hospitalized. 

Additional treatments may include: 


	
	Supportive care like intravenous (IV) fluid therapy
	
	
	Supplemental nutrition therapy, potentially through a feeding tube 
	
	
	Nebulization to keep the airways moist, and supplemental oxygen. 
	
	
	Antifungals or other medications if other causes are suspected
	


Your cat’s prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms, his response to treatment, and the initial cause of the aspiration pneumonia. When medical attention is prompt, most cats recover well.

Recovery and Management of Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats
Most cats with aspiration will require at least some time in the hospital and many will require supplemental oxygen. Hospitalization may be 1-3 days or more depending on their case. Antibiotics are likely to be prescribed to your cat for a minimum of 14 days. 



Most cats do not have any lingering issues once they have fully recovered from aspiration pneumonia. Certain cats with underlying issues may be susceptible to recurrence of aspiration pneumonia.
Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats FAQsCan cats recover from aspiration pneumonia? Yes. With prompt and adequate medical treatment, most cats diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia recover completely.
How quickly does aspiration pneumonia develop in cats? Aspiration pneumonia caused by the breathing in of vomit/stomach contents can cause symptoms in cats 1-18 days after the event. 
How do vets treat aspiration pneumonia? The mainstay of treatment of aspiration pneumonia is antibiotics. Additional treatments like intravenous fluid therapy, nutrition supplements, oxygen therapy or nebulization may be required.
What are the signs of aspiration pneumonia? Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include coughing, an increased breathing rate, breathing with the mouth open, or fever.

647,Ascites in Cats,"What is Ascites in Cats?
Ascites—also known as abdominal effusion—is the buildup of fluid in the abdomen, sometimes causing the belly to visibly swell.

The fluid that collects in the abdomen can be composed of a variety of substances, including blood, urine, or serum (the liquid component of blood). These substances can enter the abdomen due to damaged blood vessels or organs, organ enlargement, abdomen tumor growths, or abdomen inflammation.

Ascites is an uncomfortable condition because the accumulation of fluid pushes on the diaphragm, stomach, and intestines. This can cause breathing difficulties, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and low energy, among other issues. Because fluid in the abdomen is more of a symptom of an illness than its own disease, a veterinary exam and diagnostic testing are required to determine the underlying cause. Unfortunately, the cause of ascites is typically serious.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Ascites in Cats
The amount of fluid in the abdomen influences the development of symptoms. When the amount of fluid is relatively small, there may be no symptoms and X-rays are needed to diagnose ascites accurately. The buildup of large amounts of fluid in the abdomen may cause cats to develop noticeable symptoms, including the most common:


	
	Abdominal discomfort—cats resist abdomen examination or vocalize while lying down
	
	
	Abdominal swelling
	
	
	Trouble breathing (such as increased breathing rate and increased effort) and decreased ability to engage in physical activity
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Low energy and weakness
	
	
	Coughing
	
	
	Nausea and vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Changes in body temperature, either fever or hypothermia
	
	
	Weight gain
	
	
	Muscle wasting (loss of muscle tissue that makes a cat’s hip bones, ribs, and spine more easily felt and seen, though the amount of body fat may remain the same)
	
	
	Increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Heart murmur and weak pulse, if heart failure is the cause
	


Causes of Ascites in Cats
Cats can develop ascites for many reasons, including:


	
	Right-sided heart failure—when the right side of the heart is unable to pump efficiently, leading to increased pressure on blood vessels and forcing fluid from the blood vessels into the abdomen.
	
	
	Liver disease—liver dysfunction can cause a decrease in the production of albumin, a protein found in the bloodstream.
	
	
	Intestinal parasites—cause protein loss from the blood through the GI tract, which is another cause of fluid moving into the abdominal cavity.
	
	
	Nephrotic syndrome—an inflammation of the kidneys, causing loss of protein from the blood so that fluid in the kidneys’ inflamed blood vessels moves into the abdomen. Nephrotic syndrome itself can be caused by kidney infection, kidney cancer, or immune-mediated diseases that cause the body’s immune cells to attack and damage healthy kidney cells.
	
	
	Internal trauma—due to falls from high places or being hit by a car. Blood vessel rupture can lead to blood leaking into the abdomen, and bladder rupture can lead to urine leaking into the abdomen.
	
	
	Bladder rupture—due to blockage from stones or blood clots.
	
	
	Enlarged liver or spleen—may put pressure on lymph nodes and lymph vessels in the abdomen, preventing fluid from draining from the abdomen.
	
	
	Peritonitis—inflammation of the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) due to infection leads to ascites as the cells lining the abdomen become inflamed and produce too much fluid.
	
	
	Cancer—such as carcinomatosis (carcinoma throughout the abdomen) can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen by irritating the peritoneum in a similar manner as peritonitis, with cells producing excess fluid.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Ascites in Cats
In addition to the clinical signs described above, veterinarians use several tests to diagnose ascites. Imaging methods such as X-ray and ultrasound are the most common diagnostic tests used to look for fluid in the abdomen, and imaging also allows evaluation of organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, intestines, and heart to help identify the cause.

If imaging is not conclusive, other diagnostic tests such as a blood chemistry panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, and stool examination are often required to determine the cause of ascites. The veterinarian may also collect a sample of the abdominal fluid to determine its composition, looking for components like blood, bacteria, protein, or cancerous cells.

Treatment of Ascites in Cats
Treatment of ascites in cats depends upon the cause.

In some cases, the underlying cause may not be correctable, so treatment may involve surgery to place a catheter in the abdomen to allow fluid to drain. Fluid that builds up slowly may only require periodic draining while your cat is sedated. Surgical correction to prevent further fluid buildup may be necessary in cases of tumors, hemorrhage from trauma, bladder rupture from injury, or urinary blockage.

In other instances such as heart failure or liver disease, medications specific to the condition may be prescribed to reduce fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Carcinomatosis or other cancers that have spread throughout the body may need to be treated with chemotherapy rather than surgery.

Bacterial causes of ascites such as peritonitis and sepsis need to be treated with antibiotics. Although cats with abdominal fluid caused by conditions such as heart failure, liver disease, or sepsis may not be stable enough to safely undergo surgical procedures, medical management is typically the best form of treatment.  

Recovery and Management of Ascites in Cats
The timeline for recovery, overall prognosis, and chances of ascites recurring also depends on the underlying cause.

Medications and low-sodium diets can help slow the rate of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, but these therapies may not prevent ascites from recurring. Since ascites can be complicated to manage in cases of chronic or severe disease, it is crucial to take cats suspected of having fluid in the abdomen to a veterinarian or animal hospital as soon as possible.

The cat can be given the best chance of comfort and healing as the ascites is being addressed by following the veterinarian’s instructions for treatment and management, including rechecks to assess progress.

648,Arthritis in Cats,"What is Arthritis in Cats?
Arthritis (also called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis) is a chronic, painful, progressive condition involving the joints of cats. As in people, this is commonly associated with aging, and likely impacts between 70% and 90% of cats over 12 years old.

Arthritis usually takes years to develop, with many changes occurring in the joints. The cartilage that normally lines and cushions the joint breaks down, allowing bones to rub together abnormally. Nearby bone may splinter and form sharp, bony projections into the joint. These leads to swelling, inflammation, and pain in the joints.

Most affected joints include the spine, hip, knees, and elbows—although any joint can develop arthritis. It is a progressive disease, meaning it continues to worsen over time. Because these joint changes cause pain, cats can show decreased mobility and lameness when they have arthritis.

While there is no breed or sex predilection for arthritis in cats, it is typically viewed as an aging disease.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Arthritis in Cats
Some cats with arthritis may not show any obvious signs—they can be very good at hiding their pain! Some obvious signs of arthritis include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting.

However, cats may display arthritis differently, and make it difficult for owners to recognize. Some cats may become hesitant to jump or play like when they were younger. They may have decreased energy or agility falling when they attempt to jump up or down on surfaces.

It may be difficult for them to move their body without pain to groom, so cats may be more unkempt. Some pet parents note changes in posture, such as not sleeping or sitting normally. If arthritis causes pain when they use the litter box, they may associate the litter box as the cause of the pain and start eliminating outside it. It is important to note that these changes do not occur overnight and usually happen gradually.

Causes of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis can occur without known reasons, although genetics may play a role. This type is most associated with aging. Arthritis can also occur after an injury to the joint. These injuries can be minor in nature, and could be caused by:


	
	Ligament injury (such as ACL tear)
	
	
	Immune-mediated diseases, such as immune-mediated non-erosive polyarthritis
	
	
	Tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease
	
	
	Direct trauma (such as a car accidents or a fall)
	
	
	Infection
	
	
	Congenital defect
	


Arthritis progresses due to the nature of the joint itself. After an injury, the cartilage releases enzymes within the joint that cause further breakdown of the cartilage and collagen, resulting in more inflammation.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Arthritis in Cats
Veterinarians may suspect arthritis in cats based on their physical exam, but it requires further testing for a definitive diagnosis. However, some cats are stoic and asymptomatic. These cats are most often diagnosed with arthritis incidentally—after feeling abnormalities on an exam or during an X-ray.

During a physical exam, veterinarians may find the following in a cat with arthritis:


	
	Lameness
	
	
	Changes in gait, posture, or sitting position
	
	
	Difficulties sitting or getting up
	
	
	Swollen or thickened joints
	
	
	Crepitus, or clicks in joints when moving
	
	
	Pain on palpation of joints
	
	
	Decreased range of motion of joints
	


While a veterinarian may strongly suspect arthritis, they need further diagnostics to confirm. X-rays are the standard diagnostic test to easily view bones and joints for changes. X-ray abnormalities include:


	
	Joint distention
	
	
	Bony outgrowths
	
	
	Soft-tissue thickening
	
	
	Narrowed joint spaces
	
	
	Calcified free-floating bony lesions (called joint mice)
	


Veterinarians may suggest a trial of pain medications to determine the degree of pain.

Treatment of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis is extremely common with our feline companions, but there are many options to help them feel better and remain active. With appropriate management, we can slow the progression and allow them to lead very full lives. A multi-modal approach typically works best — multiple therapies used together for a better outcome.

Obesity is one of the most concerning factors for arthritis. Overweight cats put more strain on their joints. Lowering the weight of a heavy cat with arthritis is the first step to take in easing the strain on their joints. Weight reduction diets can be started. Talk to your veterinarian to discuss the right food and caloric intake for your pet.

Other treatment options include medicines, supplements, therapies, and surgery. Here is an overview of treatment possibilities for arthritic cats:

Pain Medications:


	
	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (like meloxicam and Onsior) are great at relieving pain and inflammation. However, they can have a significant strain on internal organ function and can have restrictions on the length of treatment.
	
	
	Gabapentin is used for many purposes, and its pain-reliving properties make it a good option for painful, arthritic cats.
	
	
	Opioids can be used, but they require additional precautions and may cause sedation.
	
	
	Polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (Adequan): This is an injectable prescription medication that supports joint health by stopping destructive enzymes within the joint. This medication is not labeled for use in cats, so talk to your veterinarian about using it off-label.
	
	
	Amantadine may also provide pain relief in some cats.
	
	
	Frunevetmab (Solensia) is a newer drug using monoclonal antibodies developed specifically for cats with arthritis. There are few studies in cats, but may be a beneficial drug for this treatment.

	In recent years, CBD (cannabidiol, an active ingredient in cannabis) has received attention for its pain-relief qualities. However, there is limited data in pets to know the effectiveness of CBD and similar products. In addition, legal issues surrounding CBD make it difficult to acquire, prescribe, and obtain quality and safe products.

	Stem cell therapy has shown promising work in dogs, horses, and humans, but requires more research in cats.
	
	
	Warm/cold compresses for temporary pain relief, increasing blood flow and decreasing inflammation.
	
	
	Physical therapy can help with weight loss and joint mobility.
	
	
	Surgery is not always the first step, but it may ease the pain from some forms of arthritis. It is important to note that most surgeries involving joints will not guarantee that arthritis will not return over time, but such a procedure may allow a better quality of life. Surgical options include joint fusions, joint replacement, and amputation.
	


Recovery and Management of Arthritis in Cats
Arthritis is not reversible, so cats will never fully recover. But treatments can slow its progression and lead to an increased quality of life. Many cats with arthritis show few clinical signs, so diligent monitoring is essential.

Unless a previous disease or trauma occurred, most cats with arthritis are over age 10 when diagnosed—although arthritis may have started years earlier. New studies show around 60% of cats 6 years old have signs of arthritis.

As your cat ages, you may notice decreased ability to jump, play, and groom. They may start using the bathroom outside the litter box due to pain. Without treatment, arthritis can progress to debilitating and painful diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about the appropriate steps to treat your cat with arthritis.

Prevention of Arthritis in Cats

Because obesity is linked to arthritis, it is best to keep your cat lean. If your cat is already overweight, institute a weight loss program, following your veterinarian’s advice. Ask about arthritis in cats and start using cartilage protectant medications and supplements early. By doing so, you protect the cartilage that is there before it is too late.

Some cats with arthritis may not show any obvious signs—they can be very good at hiding their pain! Some obvious signs of arthritis include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting.

However, cats may display arthritis differently, and make it difficult for owners to recognize. Some cats may become hesitant to jump or play like when they were younger. They may have decreased energy or agility falling when they attempt to jump up or down on surfaces.

It may be difficult for them to move their body without pain to groom, so cats may be more unkempt. Some pet parents note changes in posture, such as not sleeping or sitting normally. If arthritis causes pain when they use the litter box, they may associate the litter box as the cause of the pain and start eliminating outside it. It is important to note that these changes do not occur overnight and usually happen gradually.

649,Arsenic Poisoning in Cats,"Arsenic Intoxication in Cats

 

Arsenic is a heavy metal mineral that is commonly included in chemical compounds for consumer products, such as herbicides (chemicals to kill unwanted plants), insecticides (chemicals to kill insects), and as wood preservatives. Most cases of toxicity occur in homes where such compounds are placed carelessly with open excess. Cats typically ingest such compounds accidentally. Toxicity can also occur over a long term, such as when cats are exposed to arsenic by eating grass that is regularly treated with herbicides.



Symptoms and Types



In case of acute exposure to arsenic, the following symptoms may be present in an affected cat:




	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Abdominal pain
	Lethargy
	Fresh bright red blood in feces
	Lying down with extreme exhaustion
	Staggering
	Body may feel unusually cold, especially at the extremities, such as the ears and limbs
	Loss of consciousness
	Death
	In long-term (chronic) exposure symptoms may be subtle, such as poor appetite and weight loss




Causes




	Ingestion of arsenic-containing compounds
	Overdose of arsenic-containing drugs for treating heartworm parasite




Diagnosis



You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The background history is very important in the diagnosis of arsenic poisoning and your veterinarian will need to know about any arsenic-containing compounds you have at home. Many owners bring their cats to the veterinarian with complaints of a sudden and unexplained episode of vomiting. However, few owners report seeing their cats ingest arsenic-containing compounds, so this may not be the first cause that is apparent. Your veterinarian will perform a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A sample of the stomach contents may also be necessary. Arsenic in the blood stream or stomach contents will confirm the diagnosis. In cases of chronic arsenic poisoning the level of arsenic in the body can be evaluated from a hair sample, as arsenic is deposited in the hair over a course of time.



If possible, you should collect a sample of the vomit or diarrhea to take to the veterinarian. This will help to speed the diagnostic process so that your cat can be treated before further damage is done.







Treatment



Acute (sudden) arsenic poisoning is an emergency and time remains the crucial factor for a successful outcome. Vomiting plays a protective role in arsenic poisoning as it expels a large portion of the ingested poisonous material. However, if vomiting is not initiated in the immediate aftermath, your veterinarian will need to perform a gastric lavage (stomach irrigation) to wash out the stomach contents. As arsenic severely damages the liver and kidneys, dialysis is conducted for cats that are in a state of kidney failure due to arsenic poisoning. The main objective of treatment is to flush the poison out of the body; therefore fluid therapy and drugs promoting excretion are commonly employed.



Also, some compounds are known to chelate (bind) heavy metals such as arsenic, and are commonly used to bind arsenic that is still present in the body. Chelators work both by slowing the arsenic down before it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and by making it more water-soluble so that it can be washed from the body more effectively. Your veterinarian can employ such antidotes to enhance recovery in your cat. Your cat may need to be admitted into the veterinary hospital for a few days until it has stabilized and is completely out of danger.



Conversely, if you actually witnessed your cat consuming the poison, you can act quickly by inducing vomiting, but this must be done immediately following the event. If time elapses from the time of ingestion, only a veterinarian can treat your cat. For immediate first aid, if you are positive that your cat has ingested this toxic substance, try to induce vomiting with a simple hydrogen peroxide solution of one teaspoon per five pounds of body weight – with no more than three teaspoons given at once. This method should only be used if the toxin has been ingested in the previous two hours, and should only be given three times, spaced apart at ten minute intervals. If your cat has not vomited after the third dose, do not use it, or anything further, to try to induce vomiting. Do not use anything stronger than hydrogen peroxide without your veterinarian's assent. Because induced vomiting can be dangerous with some toxins, as some poisons will do more harm coming back through the esophagus than they did going down, do not induce vomiting unless you are absolutely sure of what your cat has ingested. If your cat has already vomited, do not try to force more vomiting.



A final word, do not induce vomiting if your cat is unconscious, is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Whether your cat vomits or not, after the initial care, you must take it to a veterinary facility immediately.

 

Living and Management



After returning from the hospital, allow your cat proper rest and protect it from any source of stress. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for home treatment, such as medication and nutrition. Easily digestible food is often recommended for cats that are recovering from a poisoning.



Ensure that all sources of arsenic-compounds are secured or removed. If they must be kept in the home, be sure that they are out of reach of children and pets. Most problems are easily avoided if guidelines for handling and keeping such poisonous compounds are followed.



Keep an eye on your cat and if you observe anything unusual in its behavior, immediately consult your veterinarian. Unfortunately, in many cases of heavy intoxication, very few patients survive unless treatment is started very early."," and Types

650,Arrhythmias after Blunt Heart Trauma in Cats,"Traumatic Myocarditis in Cats
 
The prevalence of serious arrhythmias after blunt trauma is relatively low but some patients develop clinically important rhythm disturbances following  trauma to the heart. Therefore, the heart rhythm of all victims of trauma should be carefully assessed.
 
Traumatic myocarditis is the term applied to the syndrome of arrhythmias – irregular heartbeats – that sometimes complicates a blunt trauma injury to the heart.  It is a misnomer, because heart muscle injuries are more likely to take the form of cell death than inflammation (as the term myocarditis suggests). Direct heart injury may not be necessary for development of post traumatic arrhythmia. Non-heart related conditions are likely to have equal or greater importance in causing arrhythmias.
 
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (abnormal patterns of electrical heart beat activity starting in the ventricles) occur in most affected patients. Ventricular rhythms that complicate blunt trauma are often relatively slow and are detected only during pauses in the normal rhythm. They are most appropriately referred to as accelerated idioventricular rhythms (AIVRs), which is recognized by a heart rate that is greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) but generally less than 160 bpm. Usually, these rhythms are harmless. However, dangerous ventricular tachycardias can also complicate a blunt trauma and can also evolve from seemingly benign AIVRs, placing the patient at risk for sudden death.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Suffered trauma 48 hours or less before signs appeared
    Possible arrhythmias
    Possible rapid, irregular rhythms
    Signs of poor blood flow to the body:
    
        Weakness
        Pale gums
    
    


Causes
 

    Blunt trauma, most often road accidents
    Low oxygen in the blood
    Autonomic (the part of the nervous system that regulates involuntary action, like digestion, heart beat, etc.) imbalance
    Electrolyte imbalances
    Acid-base disturbances


Diagnosis
 
Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.  Blood tests can be done to check for high serum troponin concentrations, a protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contractions, which would suggest myocardial necrosis.
 
Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry should be used to determine if the patient is lacking in blood oxygen (hypoxemic).
 
Further diagnostic testing will include X-ray imaging to determine the type of traumatic injuries that are present, and electrocardiogram (ECG) to analyze the ventricular arrhythmias.
 
Treatment
 
Your cat will be given fluid therapy with electrolytes (if needed) and  prescribed painkillers. Oxygen therapy should be given if your cat is hypoxemic. If pneumothorax (air free in the chest cavity - outside the lungs) is present, it will be treated.  Antiarrhythmic therapy will only be given if your cat has AIVRs and clinical signs of arrhythmia. 
 
Living and Management
 
Arrhythmias due to blunt trauma tend to resolve spontaneously within 2-3 days of the beginning of treatment. Anti-arrhythmic therapy can be discontinued after 2-5 days.  Although dangerous arrhythmias occasionally complicate blunt trauma, the prognosis for a full recovery usually depends on the severity of extracardiac (outside the heart) injury."," and Types

651,Are Cats Afraid of Thunderstorms? (Thunderstorm Phobia),"What Is Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats?
Thunderstorm phobia in cats is an exaggerated fear response to storm conditions such as thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and strong winds.

Because thunderstorms are loud, bright, and sudden, they can alarm anyone, including an already nervous cat. Cats with thunderstorm phobia immediately become anxious when they hear a storm approaching, and they sense changes in barometric pressure before and during a storm. 

Symptoms of Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats
Symptoms can include:


	
	Hiding
	
	
	Shaking
	
	
	Drooling
	
	
	Panting
	
	
	Acting restless
	
	
	Panicking/bolting
	
	
	Increased vocalizing
	
	
	Inappropriate urination/defecation
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Destructive behavior
	
	
	Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
	


Causes of Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats
Cats with thunderstorm phobia respond with fear to loud and unexpected noises and unexpected flashes of light. Like many other animals, cats are also sensitive to and detect subtle changes in the atmosphere’s pressure brought on by thunderstorms.

Some cats from unknown, abusive, or neglectful backgrounds may also be more fearful of storms, and loud noises may be triggering. Cats tend to have a flight response in uncertain situations. If there is a history of confinement, neglect, or a situation where a cat is unable to escape, it may exacerbate the potential for phobias to develop.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats
Veterinarians diagnose thunderstorm phobia in cats by:


	
	Asking about the history of your cat’s suspected storm fear
	
	
	Performing a complete physical exam to rule out other ailments or diseases (if a cat is hiding more than usual and not acting like itself for longer periods of time, there may be an underlying medical issue)
	
	
	Ordering a blood test to see if there are changes in red and/or white blood cell numbers and elevated blood sugar (glucose)

	
		
		Increases in red and white blood cell counts can occur in times of stress, although increased red blood cell counts secondary to stress are more common in dogs
		
		
		Elevated blood glucose is extremely common in stressed cats
		
	
	


Treatment of Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats
Treatment of thunderstorm phobia in cats may include:


	
	Prescription medications such as acepromazine, gabapentin, and trazodone, which all typically have sedative effects
	
	
	OTC supplements such as oral calming chews and treats that contain tryptophan, Zylkene®, hemp, and/or colostrum
	


Tryptophan is a building block for serotonin and melatonin, both of which can cause relaxation and sleepiness. For Zylkene®, there has been research around a substance in the mother’s milk that might contribute to relaxation for newborns after nursing. Alpha-casozepine, the unique-derived protein in Zylkene®, promotes a sense of relation and is a non-sedative.

While the use of hemp is still being researched in cats, it may have calming effects that act on receptors in the brain. However, the use of hemp in cats and dogs is still controversial to many veterinarians. There has been little research on colostrum to determine if it has a calming effect, but it may help  alleviate anxiety-related digestion issues.

4 Ways to Calm Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats

In addition to a treatment plan that may include medication, there are some additional ways you can help to calm your cat, including:


	
	Using feline pheromone-based calming diffusers. The Feliway® is a diffuser that is plugged into an electrical outlet and emits the pheromone into a small space.
	
	
	Using compression vests. The ThunderShirt® is a compression vest that creates a security blanket to keep your cat calm.
	
	
	Creating a small and quiet safe space where your cat can take refuge with a favorite bed/blanket/toy/treat
	
	
	Snuggling up with your cat in a quiet room (if your cat is scared but does not try to run or hide)

Recovery and Management of Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats
While some cats may become fully desensitized to thunderstorms after receiving treatment, other cats may have a lifelong phobia.

It is important to be consistent with the approach you choose to calm your cat. It is equally important to try different approaches (as recommended above) if one approach doesn’t seem to be working after several attempts.
Thunderstorm Phobia in Cats FAQsWhy are pets scared of thunderstorms?Thunderstorms are loud, bright, and sudden, which can alarm a cat who is afraid. A cat with thunderstorm phobia reacts with fear to thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and strong winds. Cats may even sense changes in the barometric pressure before and during a storm.
Is it normal for my cat to be afraid of storms?While thunderstorm phobia is more common in dogs, cats may be afraid of storms as well. Some cats respond with fear to loud and unexpected noises, and to unexpected flashes of light brought on by storms. Cats may also be sensitive to and detect subtle changes in the barometric pressure of the atmosphere. Some cats from unknown, abusive, or neglected backgrounds may also be more fearful of storms.

652,Anxiety Disorders in Cats,"What Are Anxiety Disorders in Cats?
Cats are considered both predator and prey animals. This makes them especially prone to stress and anxiety because they must remain constantly vigilant.

While your cat likely doesn’t have to worry about wild animals interrupting their afternoon snooze on the couch, they can still be affected by anxiety disorders. According to some estimates, about 20–25% of feline veterinary patients exhibit anxious behaviors.

Feline anxiety is nervousness or worry triggered when a cat anticipates a danger or threat. This can occur even if no real danger is present. Anxiety causes the cat’s body to release hormones that prepare them to face the challenge or escape, typically referred to as the fight-or-flight response.

While an anxiety disorder is not a medical emergency for cats, prolonged stress can lead to serious health consequences, such as feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) or dermatologic issues. Common anxiety issues in cats include:


	
	General anxiety—Numerous issues can cause chronic generalized anxiety in cats.
	
	
	Noise-associated anxiety—Many cats experience anxiety associated with loud noises.
	
	
	Separation anxiety—Some cats experience anxiety when they are separated from their primary pet parent. Cats who are female, who live in a home with only one person or with no other pets, or who were abandoned are more likely to have separation anxiety. In addition, Siamese, Burmese, and Tonkinese cats seem to have a high risk for the condition.
	
	
	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—Some stressed cats develop OCD, a condition that causes them to exhibit excessive or repetitive behavior such as overgrooming, constant vocalization, and destructive chewing or scratching. Persians, Siamese, and Burmese cats are predisposed to OCD.
	


Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders in Cats
The symptoms a cat has of an anxiety disorder can depend on what is causing the anxiety. Cats who have separation anxiety, for example, may be extremely clingy and become agitated when they anticipate their favorite pet parent’s imminent departure. But there are also a variety of possible generalized signs when cats feel anxious.

Other feline anxiety disorder signs can include:


	
	Body language changes—Your cat can’t speak, but they can tell you how they are feeling through their body language. Signs that indicate your whiskered friend is anxious include keeping their tail close to their body, avoiding eye contact, having dilated pupils, flicking their tail, staring, or holding their ears back.
	
	
	Hiding or escaping—When threatened, many cats hide, and they may scratch or chew on doors or windows if they feel trapped.
	
	
	Inappropriate urination—Anxious cats often avoid their litter box.
	
	
	Overgrooming—Self-licking calms cats, and an anxious cat may groom excessively, in some cases causing hair loss or wounds at the grooming site.
	
	
	Excessive vocalization—Cats often meow to get your attention, but anxious cats often meow excessively and typically in a different tone than their usual meow.
	
	
	Appetite changes—As in humans, anxiety can cause your feline friend to eat less or more than usual.
	
	
	Gastrointestinal (GI) issues—Some anxious cats experience GI issues such as vomiting or diarrhea.
	
	
	Reactivity—Anxiety may make your cat act reactively toward you or other pets or people in your home.
	


Causes of Anxiety Disorders in Cats
Numerous factors can trigger a cat’s anxiety. Common causes of feline anxiety disorders include:


	
	Illness—Any health problem can lead to feline anxiety, so if your cat is showing symptoms of anxiety, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible.
	
	
	Pain—Arthritis is extremely common in cats, but they often show no physical signs, such as limping, to indicate they’re in pain. If left untreated, chronic pain can cause significant anxiety.
	
	
	Trauma—If your cat undergoes a traumatic event, the fear they experience may trigger anxiety.
	
	
	Loud noises—Loud noises such as thunder, fireworks, the vacuum cleaner, or nearby construction can cause phobia-type anxiety.
	
	
	Change—Any change to your feline friend’s environment or schedule can lead to an anxiety problem. Examples include rearranging the furniture, visiting the veterinarian, introducing a new pet to the family, and children going back to school.
	
	
	Improper socialization—Kittens should be exposed to numerous sights, sounds, and situations for the first several months of their life. If they aren’t properly socialized, new experiences can make them anxious.
	
	
	Separation—If your cat is overly attached to you, they may experience anxiety when you are separated.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Anxiety Disorders in Cats
Seek veterinary care if your cat is showing signs of anxiety. Providing your veterinarian with a thorough history of changes in your cat’s environment helps them determine the cause of your cat’s anxiety. In addition, a video of your cat behaving anxiously is helpful.

Because illness and pain often cause feline anxiety, your veterinarian will perform diagnostic tests—which may include blood work, urinalysis, and X-rays—to rule out any underlying health issues.

Treatment of Anxiety Disorders in Cats
Any underlying health condition should be addressed as the first step in treating your cat’s anxiety disorder.

If your veterinarian determines that a health issue is not causing your cat’s anxiety disorder, the following treatment management strategies may be recommended to alleviate your cat’s anxiety:


	
	Preventing exposure—When possible, prevent exposure to whatever triggers your cat’s anxiety.
	
	
	Medication—Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants can help manage your feline friend’s anxiety disorder. Your veterinarian can determine the right medication and dose for your cat.
	
	
	Behavior modification—Techniques to modify your cat’s behavior can also help lessen their anxiety. Approaches include:

	
		
		Desensitization—Desensitization involves exposing your cat to their anxiety trigger at a low enough level that they don’t react, and gradually increasing the intensity. For example, if your feline friend is afraid of a certain noise, play a recording of the noise at a low level and gradually increase the volume as long as they don’t show anxiety signs.
		
		
		Counterconditioning—Through counterconditioning, you help your cat form a positive association with their anxiety trigger. For example, if your cat is afraid of the vacuum cleaner, give them a treat before and after you vacuum the house.
		
	
	


If these methods don’t successfully assuage your kitty’s anxiety or fears, and their anxiety disorder is affecting their (and possibly your) quality of life, it’s time to seek the help of a veterinary behaviorist.

Recovery and Management of Anxiety Disorders in Cats 
Treatment for feline anxiety disorders is often long-term, and moderate or severe cases may require lifelong management.

Minimum treatment for mild cases typically lasts four to six months. To reduce your cat’s anxiety and stress, follow these tips:


	
	Leave your cat’s carrier out so they aren’t frightened of it when they have to go to the veterinarian.
	
	
	Don’t use incense, fragrance plug-ins, essential oils, or scented candles in your home—they can irritate your cat’s sensitive nose.
	
	
	Ensure your cat’s litter box setup is acceptable by cleaning the box frequently, placing it in a convenient but quiet place, and providing at least two litter boxes for every cat in your home.
	
	
	When having guests over, create a quiet cat-safe zone where your feline family member can stay during the gathering. Leave music playing at a low volume in that area to help mute the party noise.
	
	
	Provide sufficient physical exercise and mental enrichment to prevent boredom and keep your cat engaged.
	


Certain over-the-counter calming products for cats can also help lower your kitty’s anxiety levels. Examples include:


	
	Diffusers
	
	
	Collars
	
	
	Sprays
	
	
	Supplements
	
	
	Anxiety vests

653,Antibodies that Attack Blood Cells at Lower Temperatures in Cats,"Cold Agglutinin Disease in Cats

This is a rare type II autoimmune disorder in which antibodies that attack red blood cells  have enhanced activity at temperatures of less than 99° F (37.2° C). The term agglutinin refers to an antibody that causes antigens, such as red blood cells or bacteria, to adhere to each each other.

Cold agglutinins with low thermal capacity are usually associated with direct red blood cell agglutination (adhesion)  at low body temperatures in the peripheral blood vessel network (i.e., the vessels outside of the main circulatory network). Cold limbs or other peripheral clotting phenomena are initiated or intensified by exposure to cold.

Fixation of complement and hemolysis (the release of hemogloblin in the blood stream when a red blood cell breaks) is a warm-reactive process occurring at high body temperatures; therefore, patients may have very high concentrations of cold agglutinins, but these antibodies may be unable to hemolyze red blood cells (erythrocytes) at the warmer temperatures achieved in the bloodstream.

Most cold agglutinins cause little or no shortening of red blood cell life span. High thermal amplitude cold agglutinins (rare) may cause sustained hemolysis, but the resulting anemia is often mild and stable. Exposure to cold may enhance binding of cold agglutinins and complement mediated release of hemoglobin within the vessels (intravascular hemolysis).

A low titer (concentration test) of naturally-occurring cold agglutinins (usually 1:32 or less) may be found in healthy cats, but this is without clinical significance. The disease has a genetic basis; however, mean age and range, breed, and sex predilections are unknown. The condition is more likely to occur in colder climates.

Symptoms and Types


    History of cold exposure
    Acrocyanosis (blueness of skin) 	associated with sludging of red blood cell clumps in the blood 	vessel network of the skin
    Erythema (redness of the skin)
    Skin ulceration (with secondary 	crusting/necrosis)
    Dry, gangrenous necrosis of ear 	tips, tail tip, nose, and feet
    Affected areas may be painful
    Anemia may or may not be evident: 	associated with pallor, weakness, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), 	tachypnea (rapid breathing), jaundice, change of skin color, mild 	splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), and soft heart murmur


Causes


    Primary disease – 	idiopathic (unknown)
    Secondary disease in cats – 	associated with upper respiratory infection
    Cold exposure is a risk factor


Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Diagnosis is made by the historical findings, such as exposure to cold, the results of the physical examination, and demonstrating cold agglutination (adhesion of red blood cells) in vitro.

Skin lesions typically present as inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (erythema), acrocyanosis, and ulceration of the tips of the ears and tail, nose and feet. Other associated conditions to rule out include hepatocutaneous syndrome(skin disease caused caused by liver disease); erythema multiforme (reaction to infection or medication); toxic epidermic necrolysis (blistering and peeling); dermatomyositis (skin rash caused by a muscle disease), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  – bleeding into the skin; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); lymphoreticular neoplasms (cancer caused by proliferation of red cells in the lymphs); frostbite; lead poisoning; and pemphigus (an autoimmune disease).

A diagnosis of anemia should be demonstrated by blood tests to help distinguish warm antibody hemolytic anemia (autoimmune disease) from other causes of red blood cell destruction/loss. Macroscopic hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells) in vitro may lead to rouleaux formation (stacks of red blood cells, as with coin rolls); mimicking erythrocyte agglutination (red blood cell clumping) on a glass slide.

Your cat will need to be hospitalized in a warm environment until its health has stabilized and the disease is nonprogressive. Supportive care and wound management depend on clinical signs. If necrosis involving the tail tip or feet is severe, amputation may be required.

Removal of the spleen is of little assistance in patients with IgM-mediated hemolytic disorders, but may be helpful in those with therapy-resistant IgG-mediated hemolytic anemia.

Living and Management

Animals that have suffered from this condition are prone to relapse. Keep your cat in a warm environment at all times to prevent relapse. Prognosis is guarded to fair and recovery may take weeks."," and Types

654,Antibiotic-resistant Bacterial Infections in Cats,"L-Form Bacterial Infections in Cats

L-form bacterial infections are caused by bacterial variants with defective or absent cell walls. That is, L-form bacteria are defective variations of bacterial cells, which can be almost any type of bacteria. L-forms are different from most other forms of bacteria in the respect that cell walls are an important component of organized cell division. While L-forms are still able to divide, creating more of themselves, they lack the same organizational structure as bacteria  with cell walls. L-forms replicate without regard to size, big and small, rather than being of one standard size. They have been found throughout nature, in humans, animals, and plants.

L-form bacteria are formed as a spontaneous variant of bacteria, or when cell wall synthesis is inhibited or impaired by antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), specific immunoglobulins, or lysosomal enzymes that degrade the cell walls. They can be induced from virtually all gram- positive and negative bacteria under suitable conditions. They occur sporadically in cats, and are most common in free-roaming cats of all ages.

Symptoms and Types

The site of infection is typically a surgical or bite wound. Other signs of L-form bactera infection include:


    Cellulitis (infection 	of the skin and underlying tissues)
    Fever
    Arthritis
    Synovitis (inflammation of synovial membrane, 	the soft tissue that lines the surfaces within the joints 	that possess cavities [e.g., elbow, wrist, knee])


Causes

Bites, scratches, or trauma may 	allow the organism to enter the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Formation is also encouraged by 	antibiotic treatment of the host, resistance of the host, 	suitability of the site for establishment of the infective 	bacterium, and relatively low to moderate virulence of the infecting 	bacterium.

Diagnosis

L-form bacteria are difficult organisms to isolate and identify. Using a process of differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately, the veterinarian will make a diagnosis by putting all of the signs and symptoms together, along with any consistent laboratory results, to come to a conclusion. Your doctor will also collect some of the fluid from any draining  lesions, as well as joint fluid for analysis.



Treatment

Gentle cleaning of the wound will help to degrade the fragile L-form organisms. In most cases, doctors allow the open wounds to heal by secondary intention; that is, the open edges of the wound are not intentionally closed (e.g., by stitches), but are allowed to heal by themselves, growing new tissue over the wound. The main treatment in this case is by cleansing the wound, applying antibiotic ointment to the wound, and applying fresh bandages.

Your veterinarian will prescribe medications such as antibiotics to treat the symptoms as well as the disease; however, these organisms are resistant and difficult to target with antibiotics. The fever usually breaks within 24-48 hours. In many cases, arthritic symptoms continue to persist."," and Types

656,Anemia in Cats,"What Is Anemia in Cats?
Anemia in cats is the deficiency of red blood cells and hemoglobin (or both) in a cat’s blood.

Red blood cells (RBCs), which are made by the bone marrow, are the main way oxygen is carried to the body’s tissues and organs. Specifically, an iron-containing protein in RBCs called hemoglobin carries the oxygen.

When a cat is anemic, the decrease in RBCs and/or hemoglobin leads to decreased oxygen flow to the body’s organs. This decrease in oxygen may result in damage to organs like the heart, lungs, and kidneys, potentially causing failure.

Anemia in cats is often a medical emergency and can become life-threatening. If you are noticing that your cat has pale gums, is lethargic, is collapsing, and/or has other signs of anemia, seek emergency veterinary attention.

Some causes of anemia, though emergent, may be treatable and have a good prognosis. Other cases, such as cats who are anemic with chronic kidney disease, may have a shortened life expectancy.

Types of Anemia in Cats

Anemia in cats is broadly categorized as either regenerative or non-regenerative.


	
	Regenerative anemias—When the bone marrow produces enough RBCs to correct the anemia. The cat will have a low red blood cell count, but there will be immature RBCs in circulation, indicating the body is trying to replace what it has lost.
	
	
	Non-regenerative anemias—When the bone marrow is not able to correct for the deficiency of RBCs, either because it’s not functioning properly or because the body’s resources have been exhausted. An anemia can also be non-regenerative if it’s caught too early before the body has had a chance to respond to the loss of RBCs.
	


There are many potential causes of anemia, and some causes can co-exist at the same time.

Symptoms of Anemia in Cats
Symptoms of anemia include some—or all the following:


	
	Lethargy 
	
	
	Pale gums (sometimes the gums are yellow, indicating jaundice)
	
	
	Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
	
	
	Increased heart rate
	
	
	Weakness or collapse
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	


Causes of Anemia in Cats
Anemia isn’t a disease itself but rather secondary to diseases or conditions in the body that cause anemia. The causes of anemia can be broken down into three broad categories. This includes blood loss, destruction of RBCs, and a failure to produce new RBCs.  

Blood loss can be internal (inside the body), external (outside the body), or both. Some common causes of blood loss in cats include:


	
	Trauma, such as being hit by car
	
	
	Fleas/ticks that suck blood from the body—this can be significant in newborn kittens
	
	
	Hookworm infestations that feed on the blood in the intestines
	
	
	Bleeding tumors 
	
	
	Severe stomach ulcers 
	
	
	Diseases that prevent proper blood clotting such as hemophilia
	
	
	Anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity (when a cat ingests rat poison that prevents blood clotting, leading to bleeding)
	
	
	Post-surgical complications, such as a suture on a blood vessel coming undone or breaking
	


Destruction of RBCs (also called hemolysis) can occur due to the following:


	
	Immune mediated hemolytic anemia (where the cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its RBCs) 
	
	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection or feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) 
	
	
	Certain blood parasites such as Mycoplasma haemofilis (formerly known as Haemobartonella felis), Cytauxzoon felis, and Babesia felis which are spread to cats through tick bites 
	
	
	Toxins and chemicals from onions, zinc, copper, or acetaminophen (Tylenol)
	
	
	Drugs, including reactions to antibiotics and antiparasitic agents
	
	
	Genetic diseases such as pyruvate kinase deficiency in Abyssinian and Somali cats
	
	
	Neonatal isoerythrolysis, a condition in newborn kittens when the blood type of the kitten and the mother cat are not compatible 
	
	
	Low phosphate, seen in refeeding syndrome, which occurs in cats who have been starved and then suddenly start eating a lot again, causing electrolyte abnormalities
	
	
	Cancer 
	


Failure to produce new RBCs means the bone marrow that produces RBCs is unable to keep up with the demand for new ones. When a cat is anemic, the bone marrow should be able to produce more RBCs to compensate.

Reasons for failure to produce new RBCs include:


	
	Anemia of chronic disease—Any chronic disease or illness can lead to anemia due to long-term inflammation that decreases RBC production. Chronic conditions include chronic infection, tumors, and disorders of the hormone system (such as hypothyroidism). This is the most common type of anemia in animals.
	
	
	Chronic kidney disease—The kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the development of RBCs by the bone marrow. With significant kidney disease, the kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin, decreasing RBC production (which leads to anemia). 
	
	
	Severe nutritional deficiencies or imbalances
	
	
	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)
	
	
	Autoimmune disease or inflammation affecting the bone marrow
	
	
	Chemicals or toxins affecting the bone marrow
	
	
	Cancer affecting the bone marrow or RBC directly
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Anemia in Cats
Your vet will perform a physical exam on your cat, followed by blood work. The blood work will show that your cat has a low red blood cell count or a low hematocrit (percentage of blood that is made of RBCs). The blood work may show other changes, such as a low platelet count or high white blood cell counts, which your veterinarian may use to help determine what type of anemia your cat has.

After a pet is diagnosed with anemia, your veterinarian will recommend additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the anemia.

If there are no signs of external blood loss (bleeding from wound, nose, etc.), internal bleeding will be ruled out. This is done using diagnostic imaging such as X-rays and/or ultrasound.

If no signs of bleeding are noted, your veterinarian will perform additional blood tests. They may also recommend testing for diseases spread by tick bites, or other specialized tests. 

A urinalysis should be performed to check your cat’s organ function and assess other causes of anemia. Your vet may also take a fecal sample from your cat. This is to rule out parasites.

A FeLV/FIV snap test is another important test to help your vet determine the cause of your cat’s anemia.

If there is concern the cat’s bone marrow is not responding properly, your veterinarian may recommend a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy to collect a sample of bone marrow for analysis. For this procedure, your cat is usually under anesthesia. A needle is inserted into the bone to collect a sample of the marrow. The sample is then sent to a specialty lab that can examine the bone marrow under a microscope.

Often, severely anemic cats will be sent to a local veterinary emergency hospital for hospitalization, 24-hour care, blood transfusions, advanced diagnostics, and consultation with specialists.  

Treatment of Anemia in Cats
In cases of severe anemia, a blood transfusion will likely be needed.

Once the cat is stabilized, attention will be directed at identifying and treating the underlying cause of the anemia. Treatment will vary based on the underlying cause of the anemia but may include:


	
	Steroids (prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive medications like cyclosporine or chlorambucil
	
	
	Antibiotics
	
	
	Gastroprotectant medications, which are medications that coat any ulcers and prevent worsening of vomiting if present
	
	
	Deworming medication
	
	
	Surgery in the case of a bleeding tumor or a complication from a previous surgery
	
	
	Darbepoeitin, a medication given to cats with chronic kidney disease to replace erythropoietin
	
	
	Iron supplementation
	


If your cat has gone through trauma, surgery may be needed to stop the bleeding and address the anemia. If the anemia is severe or persistent, additional transfusions, oxygen therapy, and other supportive care may be needed.  

Recovery and Management of Anemia in Cats
Severely anemic cats will likely need to be hospitalized for two to seven days while they receive treatment. Severely anemic cats or those with autoimmune conditions or cancer can have poor or uncertain prognosis. These cats may need long-term treatment.

Many cats with mild anemia—when treated early, and in overall good health—will typically make a full recovery and have no long-term effects. However, some cats with mild anemias, such as those with chronic kidney disease, may get progressively worse, even with treatment.

The prognosis for cats with blood loss, secondary to trauma, will vary depending on the extent of the trauma and how quickly they receive treatment.

Prevention of Anemia in Cats
Not all causes of anemia in cats are preventable, but there are steps you can take to decrease your cat’s overall risk. These include:


	
	Keep your cat indoors to reduce the risk of trauma and transmission of diseases like FeLV or FIV.
	
	
	Vaccinate your cat against FeLV.
	
	
	Keep your cat on parasite prevention that includes intestinal worms, fleas, and ticks.
	
	
	Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for how often your cat needs wellness exams and blood work. This will help you catch conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, early. Earlier intervention can slow progression.
	
	
	Feed your cat a regular, healthy diet.
	
	
	Keep toxic substances, such as onions or acetaminophen, out of reach of your cat.
	
	
	After surgical procedures, follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding activity restriction.
	

Anemia in Cats FAQsHow do I get an anemic cat to eat?Anemic cats may benefit from appetite stimulants like maropitant citrate (Cerenia®). You can also try feeding something extra special like warm canned food. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for managing the underlying cause of anemia.
What causes low blood count in cats?A low blood count can be caused by blood loss, the destruction of red blood cells, or a failure of the body to make enough red blood cells.

657,Anaplasmosis in Cats,"What is Anaplasmosis in Cats?
Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne illness. It’s more common in humans, dogs, and other animals, but cats do contract it in rare instances.

Cats develop anaplasmosis as a result of being bit by a tick that carries the Anaplasma phagocytophilum bacterium. As with some other tick-borne diseases, a tick must remain attached to your cat for more than 24 hours for the infection to be transferred.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anaplasmosis is found across the United States, but higher rates of the illness are reported in the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast. It is found in areas where there is a high tick population. In the Northeast, infections are most common in May, June and October.

Symptoms of Anaplasmosis in Cats
Cats usually develop symptoms within a few days to a week after the tick bite. Clinical signs may include:


	
	Poor appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Fever
	
	
	Stiff, painful joints
	
	
	Limping or trouble walking
	
	
	Enlarged lymph nodes
	
	
	Bloody nose
	
	
	Dark bloody stool
	
	
	Bruising
	
	
	Wobbly gait
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Conjunctivitis
	
	
	Protrusion of the third eyelid (inside the eye)
	


Not all cats carrying the anaplasma bacteria will have symptoms. Rarely, those that have a strong immune system will get sick for a short period of time and then recover quickly.

Causes of Anaplasmosis in Cats
The bacteria are transmitted to cats by ticks that carry the disease. Infections are highest in the late spring and autumn, when both nymph and adult ticks are most mobile. Anaplasmosis is transmitted to cats 24 to 48 hours after the tick attaches to your cat.

Anaplasmosis is not contagious from cat to cat, but it is common that all cats in the same home will get the disease at once, due to the same tick exposure.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Anaplasmosis in Cats
Your veterinarian will obtain a full history, including when a tick bite might have occurred, and conduct a complete physical examination. If the vet suspects this illness, they will order blood tests and urine tests to investigate further.



Your veterinarian might be able to diagnosis anaplasmosis by examining a blood sample under a microscope and spotting the bacteria. This is not always possible, and often requires a clinical pathologist because the organism is difficult to visualize. In most instances, your veterinarian will be looking for blood tests to indicate that your cat has thrombocytopenia (fewer platelets) or anemia (fewer blood cells); these findings suggest an Anaplasma infection because the organism affects different cells in the blood.

Anaplasmosis can be confused with other illnesses that cause fever, lethargy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, stiff joints, or dark stool. One or more of the following laboratory tests is performed to confirm the diagnosis.


	
	Wright’s stain is a special stain used on a cat’s blood sample that is examined in a microscope. This helps your veterinarian differentiate blood cells, making an infection of the blood more apparent as it allows for the bacteria to be seen on the blood smear. This used to be the primary way that veterinarians diagnosed anaplasmosis.
	
	
	Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) tests for antibodies in the serum of the blood that react with the Anaplasma organism. The serum is the part of the blood left behind when all of the cells are removed by centrifugation ( high-speed spinning of a blood sample). This test also uses a microscopic evaluation.
	
	
	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is another blood test. Typically, this test will not become positive until at least 8 days post-infection. This is a common test for cats suspected of having a long-term case of anaplasmosis.
	
	
	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the presence of Anaplasma DNA in a biological sample, usually whole blood in cats. It is a more sensitive test done without a microscope. Molecular detection by PCR is very useful to quickly identify this organism and confirm reinfection or carrier status. This is the most common way that anaplasmosis will be diagnosed by your veterinarian, who will send a blood sample from your cat to an outside laboratory for analysis.
	


Treatment of Anaplasmosis in Cats
If your cat has severe anemia or thrombocytopenia, they might need a blood transfusion. Most of the time, anaplasmosis is treated with an oral antibiotic such as doxycycline. This drug works well but it has been associated with a narrowing of the esophagus, so it’s important to give your cat at least 5 milliliters of water or food after each dose.

Cats generally feel better 24-28 hours after starting the antibiotic, but do not stop administering the medication. Closely follow the vet’s instructions and administer every pill provided to your cat. A typical course of antibiotics lasts 2 to 4 weeks. 

Recovery and Management of Anaplasmosis in Cats
With correct treatment, the prognosis for cats with anaplasmosis is good. If your cat doesn’t seem to improve within a few days of starting antibiotics, they should be tested for other vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.



Most cats make a full recovery from anaplasmosis, but your veterinarian will want to monitor them afterward to be sure that the infection has cleared. Expect to bring your cat in for checkups two months after finishing antibiotics; treatment is considered successful once your cat has had two to three consecutive negative tests.

To reduce your cat’s chances of developing anaplasmosis in the future, limit outdoor access, use preventive medications, and conduct daily tick checks. Year-round tick prevention should be part of your cat’s preventive care, especially if ticks are common in your area.

Cats can still get ticks even if they are on monthly preventive treatment. It’s best to check your cat often if you live in an area where ticks are prevalent and after your cat comes in from outdoors (if applicable). Ticks are typically found near a cat’s neck, head, or ears, and in the creases under their legs.
Anaplasmosis in Cats FAQs Can cats get anaplasmosis?Yes. It is more commonly seen in dogs and other animals, but in rare cases cats do get this tick-borne infection.
What are the signs and symptoms of anaplasmosis?Symptoms may include those associated with bleeding (like a bloody nose or bruising) as well as poor appetite, lethargy, fever, or trouble walking.
Is anaplasmosis curable?Yes. Oxytetracycline antibiotics are effective in treating anaplasmosis. The most common antibiotic in this family of medications that will be prescribed to your cat is doxycycline.
What happens if anaplasmosis is not treated?Anaplasmosis can be fatal if left untreated. Some cats carry the infection for a long time without any noticeable symptoms, but there is a risk that symptoms will eventually arise.

658,Anaphylaxis in Cats,"What is Anaphylaxis in Cats?
Anaphylaxis (also called allergic shock or anaphylactic shock) is an extreme allergic reaction that can quickly become a life-threatening event for cats. This is a medical emergency that can be fatal if not promptly treated.

Allergies occur when the body mistakes a substance (called an allergen) for a threat and releases cells to fight off the perceived invader. This allergic reaction is usually minor, such as itchy skin or sneezing. But in serious cases, the entire body can react in anaphylactic shock.

The reaction may occur with the first exposure to an allergen, but more often it is subsequent encounters that lead to shock.

A cat’s lungs are the most common area impacted by anaphylactic shock, which can affect breathing. Other major body systems affected by shock include the gastrointestinal systems (esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, and intestinal tract). Fortunately, this condition is rare in cats.

If you suspect your cat is having an anaphylactic reaction, take them to a veterinarian or animal hospital immediately.

Symptoms of Anaphylaxis in Cats
The most common signs of anaphylaxis occur within seconds to minutes (acute onset):


	
	Severe respiratory distress, difficulty breathing
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Excessive drooling
	
	
	Excitement, restlessness
	
	
	Incoordination
	
	
	Pale gums
	
	
	Cold limbs
	
	
	Facial swelling
	
	
	Itchy skin around head and face
	
	
	Seizures
	
	
	Coma
	


Anaphylaxis can be fatal in rare cases. Although the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems are the organs most impacted, anaphylaxis can affect other body systems as well:


	
	Respiratory system (lungs)—Difficulty breathing, open-mouth breathing (panting), coughing
	
	
	Gastrointestinal system (stomach, intestines, pancreas, etc.)—Vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, drooling
	
	
	Cutaneous system (skin)­—Itchy skin anywhere on the body but more prominent around area of allergen contact, facial swelling
	
	
	Cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels)­—Pale gums, cold limbs
	
	
	Nervous system (brain and spinal cord)—Seizures, incoordination, excitement, restlessness, coma
	
	
	Ocular system (eyes)—Cloudiness or redness in the eyes
	


Causes of Anaphylaxis in Cats
It’s not possible to predict when anaphylaxis will occur, but cats with known allergies may be at higher risk. This rare but potentially deadly form of shock can occur as an immediate reaction to many things in the environment or from an ingested substance.

Specific causes of anaphylaxis in cats include:


	
	Venom injected from insects such as bees, wasps, hornets and fire ants.
	
	
	Reptile venom
	
	
	Food
	
	
	Chemotherapy agents
	
	
	Blood transfusions
	
	
	Antibiotic eye ointments containing polymyxin B (this reaction typically occurs within 10 minutes)
	
	
	Surgery to remove heartworms (heartworm ruptures)
	
	
	Medications taken by mouth, such as antibiotics, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and opiates.
	
	
	Contrast material used for special imaging such as an MRI
	
	
	Vaccines/antibiotics
	
	
	Physical factors such as cold or exercise
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Anaphylaxis in Cats
Diagnosing anaphylaxis can be difficult because of its widespread impact on the body. A veterinarian will suspect shock based on the sudden onset of characteristic signs following exposure to a known or possible allergen.

Uncovering the allergen’s source requires a thorough review of a cat’s medical history, medications, lifestyle, environment, and vaccination history. Any changes to diet should also be reported, including treats and table/human food they ate in the last 24 hours.

Your veterinarian will do a complete physical examination to check your cat’s vital functions and run blood work to look for things like excess inflammatory cells (such as mast and white blood cells) and liver enzyme elevations.

An ultrasound of the abdomen and x-rays of the chest may be recommended to evaluate the heart, lungs, and other internal organs such as the liver and gallbladder for signs of anaphylaxis. Your veterinarian will likely recommend overnight hospitalization.

Treatment for Anaphylaxis in Cats
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical intervention. While the diagnosis may not be made immediately, your vet will work quickly to treat your cat’s symptoms.   

The goal of treatment is to stabilize the cat, ensure the airway is clear, and insert an IV catheter to administer fluids, medication, and other therapies. An injection of epinephrine (the hormone adrenaline) will be given to counteract the effects of the immune system reaction.

Epinephrine will help stimulate the heart, open the tubes in the airway, and remove the inflammatory cells from the blood stream, which will reduce the symptoms of anaphylaxis. In severe cases, a breathing tube may be inserted to provide oxygen.

Other medications such as steroids and antihistamines can also be helpful in the long term and play an important role in preventing a late-phase reaction, a recurrence of clinical symptoms.

Recovery and Management of Anaphylaxis in Cats
Cats experiencing anaphylaxis should be monitored closely by a veterinarian for at least 48-72 hours after the reaction, even if the clinical signs appear to improve, because rebound reactions can occur.

The prognosis for an anaphylaxis depends on its severity and how fast symptoms progressed. Your vet can help develop strategies to avoid the trigger if it is identified. Allergens can in some cases be uncovered through skin allergen testing.
Anaphylaxis in Cats FAQsHow long does anaphylactic shock last in cats?Anaphylactic shock can last from just a few minutes to periods up to 72 hours. Cats that experience anaphylaxis should be monitored closely by a veterinarian for at least 48-72 hours after the reaction. It’s important they are observed for an extended period, because clinical signs can improve and then quickly reappear after several hours.
How long does it take a cat to recover from an allergic reaction?Once the allergen is removed, it can still take a few days for all symptoms to resolve. Animals often require close monitoring in a vet hospital for 24-48 hours after treatment has begun, and up to 72 hours after the signs began.

659,Anal Gland Disorders in Cats,"What Are Anal Gland Disorders in Cats?
Anal glands are small pouches inside a cat’s bottom on either side of the anus. Anal glands are also called anal sacs, because they are little sacs lined with glands that produce an odorous brown substance.

When a cat has a bowel movement, a little bit of the anal gland secretions is squeezed out with the feces. This unique odor, or “scent signature,” allows cats to readily identify one another’s excrement.

Anal gland disorders are not common in cats; however, some cats may struggle with anal gland impaction, which is when the cat’s anal glands become plugged up.

When a cat experiences anal gland impaction, the anal gland is unable to empty its contents and becomes swollen and painful. This can lead to severe discomfort in a cat. If they are unable to express the impacted sac, their anal gland can rupture.

Most anal gland disorders in cats are readily treated, but anal gland disorders can be a medical emergency.  If your cat has an impacted or infected anal gland and is experiencing swelling, pain, or is not willing to eat or cannot get comfortable, seek veterinary care immediately.

Types of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats


	
	Anal gland impaction—The blocking of the anal glands. This is caused by the overaccumulation of liquid inside the glands and its inability to be discharged.
	
	
	Anal gland abscess—A painful, inflamed swelling on one or both sides of the anus. This is caused by an infection in the anal glands.
	
	
	Anal gland rupture—The bursting of the abscess on the anal glands. This is caused by an untreated infection and the building pressure of fluid inside the anal glands.
	
	
	Anal gland cancer—The overproduction of abnormal cells within the anal glands, which can cause a tumor to grow within the anal sacs.
	


Symptoms of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
Symptoms of anal gland disorders in cats may include:


	
	Redness or swelling of the rear end near the anus
	
	
	Chewing, biting, or licking at the anus or tail
	
	
	Licking or pulling hair from their back end or tail if unable to reach their anus
	
	
	Dragging the rear end on the ground
	
	
	Draining or oozing wound near the anus
	
	
	Hair loss of tail or belly from excessive grooming
	
	
	Discomfort or pain when sitting or having bowel movements
	
	
	Constipation
	
	
	Hard swellings on either side of the anus
	


Causes of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
Anal gland impaction occurs when the little duct that drains the sac gets plugged up. Often this is the result of an infection by bacteria.

There are always bacteria in poop. Sometimes, strains of bacteria can overgrow, or the bacteria can travel the opposite direction through the ducts to the anal sac.

Usually this is not problematic, as it is just expelled from the sac when it empties.

If the bacteria lead to inflammation or irritation of the duct however, then the sac cannot empty and it serves as a perfect breeding ground for the bacteria to rapidly multiply.

This can lead to infection of the anal sac and formation of an abscess, or large pocket filled with pus. Abscesses cause a lot of pain and swelling until they rupture, leaving a draining wound or sore in their wake.

Cancer in the anal glands is rare in cats and has a suspected genetic component, with Siamese and Burmese breeds having a higher incidence rate. The most common type of cancer seen in the anal gland is anal sac adenocarcinoma.

Normal emptying of the sac is triggered by exercise and passage of stool out of the anus. Obese cats are more likely to struggle with delayed emptying of their anal sacs than cats with a healthy body condition score.

Overweight cats tend to exercise less, and thus have less natural emptying of the sacs. Additionally, their extra weight can compress the duct openings, making emptying more challenging.

If a cat does not have enough fiber in their diet they can also struggle with soft stools, which affects emptying.

Sometimes, genetics plays a role in a cat having tiny openings of their ducts. That means they can more readily become impacted even if your cat has a healthy weight and a good diet.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
Your veterinarian will start by doing a thorough physical exam. After donning gloves, your vet will palpate (feel) each anal gland in your cat’s rear end.

Let your veterinarian know if your cat has had trouble with their anal glands in the past, or if they are experiencing decreased appetite, lethargy, or vomiting.

Anal gland disorders can be very painful in cats. If possible, your vet will want to express the anal glands by applying gentle pressure to empty their contents. Don’t be alarmed if your cat seems upset by the procedure.

Sometimes sedation is necessary if they are too impacted and/or painful, or if a cat is fractious and will not allow a thorough exam.

Most anal gland disorders are diagnosed with a physical exam. If there is a draining sore or wound associated with an anal sac, your veterinarian may elect to do impression smears where they get some of the discharge and look at it under the microscope to identify bacteria.

They may also elect to culture the drainage to determine the best antibiotic to clear the infection.

If a mass is felt associated with the anal sac, they may remove some of the cells in the mass, then look at the cells under the microscope or send them to a lab for further study. Biopsies may be required if cancer is suspected.

Treatment of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
Treatment of anal gland disorder in cats is geared toward restoring normal function of the anal gland.

If your cat’s anal gland is impacted, treatment may be as simple as manually expressing the gland to empty its contents by hand.

Sometimes this requires an infusion to soften the material in the sac if the contents are too hard and dry to be expelled.

Sedation may be necessary if the anal gland area is especially swollen, tender or painful. Most of the time this procedure can be done with no need for your cat to be hospitalized.

Your veterinarian will then most likely recommend that your cat get on a regular schedule to have their anal glands expressed to prevent future anal gland impaction.

If the anal gland is infected, antibiotics may be prescribed. Pain medications—like Onsior® or gabapentin—may also be part of your cat’s treatment.

If the anal sac has ruptured, then your cat may need wound care in addition to antibiotics.

Very rarely, such as in the case of cancer or chronic infection issues, surgery is recommended to remove the anal gland.

Recovery and Management of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
Most cats with anal gland disorders respond well to treatment and recover quickly after their anal glands are emptied. Occasionally, like in the case of a ruptured anal gland, they may require additional veterinary visits for wound care during the healing process.

A recovery cone is helpful to prevent your cat from licking/chewing at the wound.

Sometimes, topical products are recommended during wound care. Be sure to use a recovery cone if a topical is being used so that your cat doesn’t ingest the medication.

Never use any products on open wounds without talking to your veterinarian about it first.

Prevention of Anal Gland Disorders in Cats
With nutrition and obesity linked to anal gland disorders in the cats, the best thing you can do as a pet parent to prevent problems with the anal glands is to feed a healthy diet and keep your cat at their optimum body condition.

High-fiber diets like Hill’s® Biome and Royal Canin® Fiber Response can be helpful in bulking stool to help your cat’s anal glands express themselves more naturally.

Exercise is also helpful. Consider a laser pointer or cat toy to interact with your cat and get them to increase their activity levels to remain at a healthy weight.

Several supplements contain fiber and probiotics that may benefit a cat with anal gland disorders. Glandex® for Cats comes in a powder that you can sprinkle on their food to make administration easy.

If your cat has been diagnosed with an anal gland disorder , keep them on a regular schedule to have their anal glands expressed to prevent anal gland impaction.

Sometimes they will pluck hair off their back ends or even their tail. They will occasionally scoot, and sometimes swelling can be seen on either side of the anus.
Can you home-treat an anal gland abscess rupture?Anal gland abscesses that rupture usually need to be addressed by a veterinarian because antibiotics may be needed to facilitate recovery.

660,Anal Gland Cancer in Cats,"What Is Anal Gland Cancer in Cats?
All cats have two anal sacs located between the muscles on each side of the anal sphincter, just past the anal opening/anus. These anal sacs are lined with glands that produce debris, which normally comes out from a small opening on either side of the anus when the cat has a bowel movement.

Anal gland cancer in cats, referred to as anal sac adenocarcinoma, occurs when there is an overproduction of abnormal anal gland cells. While this condition is not common in cats, any cat can develop this cancer.

Symptoms of Anal Gland Cancer in Cats
Common symptoms of anal gland cancer in cats include:


	
	Difficulty having a bowel movement
	
	
	Constipation
	
	
	Blood or other abnormal discharge during a bowel movement
	
	
	A change in the consistency of the feces and/or smaller stool size
	
	
	Increased litter box use
	
	
	Swelling or inflammation (redness) around the anal area
	
	
	Overgrooming of the anal area
	
	
	Holding the tail in a different position than usual
	
	
	Decreased appetite
	
	
	Lethargy
	


Causes of Anal Gland Cancer in Cats
The exact cause of anal gland cancer in cats is unknown, but there may be a genetic component to this type of cancer. There may also be a link to elevated blood calcium (hypercalcemia) secondary to changes in the parathyroid gland from cancer cells.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Anal Gland Cancer in Cats
A thorough medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests will aid a veterinarian in diagnosing anal gland cancer in cats. A physical exam will likely show changes in the anal area that may include:


	
	Swelling
	
	
	Inflammation
	
	
	Pain
	
	
	Bleeding or pus
	
	
	Ulcers/wounds of the skin surrounding the anus
	


Common diagnostic tests for anal gland cancer in cats include:


	
	A blood panel (CBC and chemistry), which may show elevated blood calcium, with secondary elevations in kidney values and possible elevations in liver values if the tumor is spreading
	
	
	Radiographs (x-rays) of the chest, which may reveal tumor spread into the lungs
	
	
	Abdominal ultrasound, which may show abnormal changes in some of the lymph nodes that are the closest to the anal sacs
	
	
	A cytology slide of the debris from the anal sacs, which may reveal abnormal anal gland cells
	
	
	A biopsy for histopathology review of the abnormal anal gland tissue, which will confirm a diagnosis of anal gland cancer
	


Treatment for Anal Gland Cancer in Cats
Surgical removal of the anal sacs is the preferred treatment option for anal gland cancer in cats. Chemotherapy is another option, but it is not commonly used in cats with anal gland cancer. Radiation therapy is another possible option, but this is also rarely used in these cases.

Surgical removal is not a viable option for anal gland cancer that has spread to the lungs, liver, or other areas of the body. Older cats with other medical issues may also not be good surgery candidates.

Supportive care is indicated for cats who are not good candidates for surgery. It may include:


	
	Appetite stimulant medication
	



	
	Fluid supplementation (subcutaneous fluids)
	
	
	Stool softeners (such as lactulose or canned pumpkin)
	
	
	Enema to help relieve constipation (administered only by a veterinarian)
	


Recovery and Management of Anal Gland Cancer in Cats
Complications from surgical removal of the anal sacs can include:


	
	Bleeding from the surgery site
	
	
	Poor healing or infection of the surgery site
	
	
	Constipation
	
	
	Fecal incontinence (inability to control a bowel movement)
	


Because the entirety of the tumor(s) may be difficult to remove, tumor regrowth is another possibility.

Despite surgery and/or chemotherapy, anal gland cancer in cats has a poor prognosis. The main goal of surgery, chemotherapy, and palliative care should focus on keeping the cat comfortable, with minimal suffering. If the pet parent and veterinarian agree that the cat is suffering with a poor quality of life, humane euthanasia may ultimately be considered.

661,Anaerobic Bacterial Infections in Cats,"Anaerobes are a normal part of the body's chemical community, living in symbiosis in the cat's abdomen, vaginal canal, intestines and mouth. However, when something happens to disrupt the balance of bacteria, such as what occurs with deep injuries, surgery or internal infections, these bacteria can invade the tissue, leading to deep infection and tissue death. If left untreated, an anaerobic infection can lead to shock and even death. 
 
The bacteria which cause anaerobic infections are able to grow best in the absence of free oxygen. Consequently, these bacteria often thrive in the mouth around the gums; in deep wounds, such as those caused by puncture to the skin; in wounds caused by fractured bone, where the bone has broken through to the surface; and in deep bite wounds.
 
Symptoms and Types
 
Depending on the cause of the anaerobic infection, cats may display a variety of symptoms. Cats that have developed an anaerobic bacterial infection because of a wound, for instance, may display bite marks, have pus oozing from the wound, or open fractures (where bone sticks out). Moreover, wounds infected with anaerobic bacteria will be slow to heal. Other common symptoms of anaerobic bacterial infections in cats include fever, lameness, difficulty eating, and loss of appetite (related to infection of the gums).

There are also several types of bacteria that can lead to infections, including: 




    Bacteroides
    Fusobacterium
    Actinomyces
    Clostridium
    Peptostreptococcus


Causes



The ultimate cause of an anaerobic bacterial infection is the disruption of normal bacterial balance within the cat's body. This can be due to deep injury, trauma, or recent surgical procedures (such as abdominal surgery or when metal implants are placed within the body to support broken bones).


Diagnosis
 
You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as injuries, even slight injuries, fights your cat might have had with another animal, problems eating (which may be related to a mouth infection), and any recent surgeries. Your doctor will need to rule out other causes before making a confirmation of anaerobic infection. 
 
Standard tests include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, any of which may show a higher than normal white blood cell count, or evidence of a systemic infection. Your veterinarian will be taking samples of any pus along with the tissue (skin/muscle) around the wound to be laboratory cultured (grown) without oxygen. If there is growth, this may be taken as a confirmation that anaerobic bacteria are present. 

  


 
Treatment
 
Your veterinarian will put your cat on long-term antibiotics. While it can be frustrating to give your cat pills for weeks, it is essential to do so for the entire course, even after the symptoms have passed and your cat appears to be better. If even a small amount of the infection remains, it can return worse than before. For especially reluctant cats, many of them will eat pills that have been hidden in a small amount of food that your cat does not normally receive, such as a piece of fresh fish or chicken meat (cooked). If you use this method to give antibiotics to your pet, always be sure that the cat has eaten and swallowed the entire bite of food and that it is not spitting it out in a hidden place (behind a couch, etc.).  
 
Specific treatment will be dependent on whether the infection is in an easily reachable location. If the infection is in the muscles (of the legs, back, rump, neck, etc.) the veterinarian will open the wound, clean out the dead tissue and expose the tissue to oxygen. If the anaerobic infection is within the body, such as an infected uterus, inside the bones, or in the abdomen, then the veterinarian will have to anesthetize the cat to surgically open and clean and/or drain the wounds.  
 
Living and Management
 
These infections are often long-lasting and require long-term antibiotics and monitoring by a veterinarian. It is important to give the antibiotics to your cat on time and as your veterinarian has instructed. If there is bandaging, have your veterinarian go over cleaning and redressing procedures, to ensure that the wound is able to heal. You may need to use am Elizabethan collar, or cone, to keep your cat from getting to the wound. 
 
Be sure to take your cat back for regular follow-up appointments so that wounds may be reopened and cleansed if necessary. Biochemical profiles will also be repeated at follow-up veterinary visits to check on the status of the infection.  
 
In-between visits, you should call your veterinarian if you notice any changes in your cat's behavior. If the cat seems very tired, has no appetite, or has any redness, swelling or pus at the site of the wound, for example, be sure to consult your veterinarian immediately.  
 
During the healing process, you may need to limit or prevent your cat's outdoor time, to prevent the infected site from getting dirty, and keep the litter box cleaner than usual (i.e., cleaning after each use) to prevent additional bacteria from entering the wound."," and Types

"
662,Amyloidosis in Cats,"What Is Amyloidosis in Cats?
Amyloidosis in cats is a condition in which a protein called amyloid is deposited in various tissues and organs throughout the body. This buildup of proteins can lead to organ dysfunction and illness in your cat.

Although this condition is uncommon in most cats, it does occur more often in certain breeds, including:


	
	Abyssinians
	
	
	Siamese
	
	
	Burmese
	
	
	Tonkinese
	
	
	Devon Rex
	
	
	Oriental Shorthairs
	


Amyloid can be deposited throughout the body, or it can be localized in a specific area or organ system. This abnormally folded protein inserts itself into these areas, displacing normal cells.

Amyloidosis can be deadly if enough of the protein is deposited into important organs, such as the kidneys, liver, or heart. This condition can develop in cats of any age, but it predominantly affects cats who are 7 years old or older.

Another form of amyloidosis, known as senile systemic amyloidosis, occurs in older cats and is often characterized by small deposits that have little to no effect on a cat’s health. This form is often seen as an incidental finding during a necropsy on cats who have died from other conditions.

Symptoms of Amyloidosis in Cats
Signs of amyloidosis in cats vary depending on the area(s) of the body affected. The most common organs involved in amyloidosis in cats are the kidneys, which can cause:


	
	Lethargy
	
	
	Changes in appetite
	
	
	Increased thirst and increased urination
	
	
	Weight loss
	
	
	Dull hair coat
	
	
	Depression and weakness
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Diarrhea
	
	
	Dehydration
	
	
	Fluid accumulation under the skin, in the abdomen, and/or in the chest
	
	
	Severe kidney disease, resulting in:

	
		
		Mouth ulcers
		
		
		Development of blood clots (which can lead to breathing difficulties, weakness, and an inability to use the hind legs)
		
	
	


Cats with amyloidosis of the liver may also exhibit yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and internal bleeding, which can be evident as a distended abdomen, pale gums, rapid breathing, or collapse.

Causes of Amyloidosis in Cats
The exact cause of amyloidosis in cats is unknown. Some cat breeds are genetically predisposed to amyloidosis, such as Abyssinians, who have an abnormal gene that causes excessive amyloid to be produced. Amyloidosis can also be caused by an infection, cancer, or other immune-mediated or inflammatory conditions.

There are different types of amyloid proteins, including:


	
	AA amyloid is often a result of a long-term inflammatory condition, a chronic bacterial infection, or cancer. AA amyloid often deposits in organs such as the spleen or kidneys, leading to kidney failure. While this type of genetic renal (kidney) amyloidosis is not common in cats in general, it’s often seen in Abyssinian cats.
	
	
	AL amyloid is another form of protein deposit and is often linked with cancer. This type affects the joints or nerve tissue, such as plasma cell tumors or myelomas.
	


How Veterinarians Diagnose Amyloidosis in Cats
If your cat is not feeling well, your vet will run a variety of diagnostic tests depending on what they suspect the underlying cause to be. Urine testing and blood work, including a complete blood count (CBC) and a biochemistry panel, will help determine if there is any organ dysfunction.

Your veterinarian will likely recommend an abdominal ultrasound, which can look at the architecture of the organs to determine if there is an abnormality in their structure. This ultrasound can also help your vet in performing biopsies of anything abnormal within the belly.

Amyloidosis is difficult to diagnose. If your cat has chronic kidney or liver failure or other forms of chronic infection or inflammation, your vet might suspect amyloidosis. Once a cat starts to show clinical signs of amyloidosis, the disease is often already in its later stages and can be fatal. Thus, most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed through necropsy.

A biopsy of affected organs will show amyloid protein deposits, which is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. A biopsy can be performed both before and after death.

Treating Amyloidosis in Cats
There is no specific treatment for amyloidosis to remove the protein deposits or stop them from accumulating. Rather, treatment is aimed at decreasing the production of any more amyloid by controlling the underlying condition and treating the clinical signs.

Any underlying medical condition such as cancer, infection, or inflammation should be treated if possible. If your cat has kidney or liver failure, hospitalization with IV fluids for at least 72 hours is recommended for diuresis (increasing urine production). Antibiotics might also be given if there is evidence of a urinary tract infection or kidney infection. Also, kidney disease caused by amyloidosis can cause high blood pressure, which needs to be treated as well.

Amyloidosis in Cats Recovery and Management
Once your cat is stabilized with medical intervention by your veterinarian, outpatient management will focus on keeping the cat’s organs as healthy as possible.

With kidney disease, a special low-protein diet is helpful, along with any necessary medications to correct electrolyte abnormalities and promote kidney health. Cats with liver disease are often maintained on a special diet and antioxidant medications.

Amyloidosis is a potentially fatal disease. If the kidneys are involved, most cats survive less than a year. Cats who are less affected may not develop kidney failure for some time, if at all, and therefore may have a normal life expectancy.
Amyloidosis in Cats FAQsAt what age do cats get amyloidosis?Most cats affected by amyloidosis are at least 7 years old, but it can occur at any age. In genetically linked amyloidosis in Abyssinian and Siamese cats, the average age of onset is much younger: less than 5 years of age and as early as 1 year old. There is currently no genetic test for this condition.
Which breeds of cat get amyloidosis?Although rare in general, Abyssinian and Siamese cats commonly develop kidney amyloidosis. Oriental Shorthairs, Siamese, and Devon Rex cats are predisposed to liver amyloidosis.

663,Amphetamine Poisoning in Cats,"Amphetamine Toxicity in Cats

A prescription medication, amphetamines are used to treat ADD/ADHD and narcolepsy in humans. They are used for weight loss as well. They can also be obtained illicitly (crystal meth, methamphetamine, ecstacy). When ingested by your cat, however, amphetamines can be very toxic.

Amphetamine toxicity can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms

Possible symptoms of amphetamine poisoning in cats include:


	Restlessness
	Panting
	Hyperactivity
	Sedation
	Agitation/irritability/aggression
	Muscle tremors
	Seizures
	Increased heart rate
	Dilated pupils
	Elevated blood pressure
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Drooling
	Death


Causes

Most cases of amphetamine poisoning in cats are accidental, caused by the cat ingesting pills that are dropped on the floor. Cats may also find and ingest medication from pill bottles left on countertops and in other accessible areas. Occasionally, the drug may be given to the cat purposely.

Diagnosis

After asking you questions regarding the cat's medical history, your veterinarian will observe the animal for clinical signs consistent with amphetamine ingestion. Blood, urine or stomach contents can be tested for the presence of amphetamines, but it generally takes several days for results to be obtained. Therefore, treatment for amphetamine poisoning must be initiated before these results are returned.

Treatment

Consult your veterinarian for instructions.

Activated charcoal may be used to adsorb the poison in the stomach. Gastric lavage (“pumping the stomach”) may be necessary as well.

Intravenous fluid therapy may be necessary to dilute the toxicity. Your veterinarian may also administer sedatives and/or anticonvulsants to control seizures and reduce stimulation of the nervous system. Cooling measures may be necessary if the cat’s body temperature rises to dangerous levels.

Finally, your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat’s blood chemistry results. Kidney function tests must be closely monitored in cats poisoned with amphetamines. Additionally, blood pressure and body temperature must be monitored.

Living and Management

Once returned home, a cat that has suffered from amphetamine poisoning must be kept in a calm quiet atmosphere to facilitate recovery.

Prevention

In order to prevent accidental amphetamine poisoning, keep all prescription medications secured in a location inaccessible to your cat.","

Possible symptoms of amphetamine poisoning in cats include:


	Restlessness
	Panting
	Hyperactivity
	Sedation
	Agitation/irritability/aggression
	Muscle tremors
	Seizures
	Increased heart rate
	Dilated pupils
	Elevated blood pressure
	Vomiting
	Diarrhea
	Drooling

664,Amitraz Poisoning in Cats,"Amitraz Toxicosis in Cats

Amitraz is a chemical that is used as a tick preventive in many formulations, including tick collars, topical preparation and dips. It is also used to treat parasitic infections such as mange. Amitraz poisoning is rarer in cats than in dogs. When seen, it usually results from the improper use of a dog product on a cat.

Symptoms and Types


    Minor to severe      depression
    Weakness
    Incoordination
    Lying on side, not      moving
    Slow heart rate
    Low body temperature
    Vomiting
    Diarrhea
    Increased urination
    Death


Causes

Amitraz toxicity is caused by ingestion of or exposure to products containing amitraz. Amitraz toxicity may occur in cats when dog products containing amitraz are used on the cat or when the cat contacts a dog with amitraz still present on the skin and/or hair coat.

Diagnosis

The pet’s history may reveal exposure to a product containing amitraz. Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) may be normal but hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) is a common finding. Less commonly, elevations of the liver enzymes may be seen also.



Treatment

If amitraz is present on the skin and hair coat, the cat should be washed with a dish-washing detergent or other shampoo to remove the residue, then rinsed thoroughly with warm water. Supportive therapy such as intravenous fluids, maintenance of body temperature and nutritional support may be necessary. The cat should be closely monitored.

If a collar or part of a collar has been ingested, it should be removed with the use of an endoscope (a long slender tube that is inserted into the intestinal tract). Hydrogen peroxide may be used to induce vomiting and clean any remaining amitraz out of the stomach. Activated charcoal is often used to help prevent further absorption of the amitraz from the stomach and intestinal tract as well.

Other drugs that are sometimes used include yohimbine and atipamezole."," and Types

665,Ameba Infection in Cats,"Feline Amebiasis

Amebiasis, a parasitic infection caused by a one celled organism known as an ameba, can affect people as well as dogs and cats. It is found most often in tropical areas and can be seen in North America.

Symptoms and Types

Entamoeba histolytica is the species of ameba which has the ability to infect cats. Infection results in colitis causing severe intractable diarrhea. Blood in stool may also be associated with amebiasis.

Causes

Entamoeba histolyticus is most often spread through the ingestion of infected human feces. Young cats and those that are immunosuppressed are the most likely to become ill.

Diagnosis

Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urine testing (urinatlysis) are usually performed and are often normal although evidence of dehydration, if present, can be seen in these tests.

Other laboratory tests your veterinarian may recommend include:


    Biopsies of the colon      obtained by colonoscopy (examination of the colon with a long cylindrical      scope with a light.) Biopsies may reveal damage to the intestinal lining      as well as trophozoites (a stage in the life cycle of the infecting      organism.)
    Fecal examination      looking for trophozoites. Trophozoites can be difficult to find in the      feces. Special stains are often used to increase their visibility.




Treatment

Metronidazole is used to control the symptoms of colitis and is usually successful."," and Types

666,Allergies in Cats,"What are Allergies in Cats?
An allergy is an immune response sensitivity to certain substances that cause allergic reactions. These are classified as antigens or allergens. Typically, allergens are inherently harmless (like pollen, foods, or dust), but in certain individuals, the body overreacts and stimulates an inflammatory response that causes allergy symptoms.

Humans with allergies typically have symptoms like itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Our feline companions may also have these issues, but more commonly display allergies in a combination of the following body systems:


	
	Skin: Itchiness can cause cats to lick, chew, or rub their skin and fur, leading to infections and hair loss. The skin is the most affected organ system.
	
	
	Gastrointestinal: Symptoms usually show as vomiting or diarrhea.
	
	
	Respiratory: This includes the lower and upper airways, often with nasal discharge.
	
	
	Ocular: Allergens often cause conjunctivitis.
	


Allergies are extremely common in cats and it’s typically a life-long condition that can impact the cat and pet parent’s quality of life. While some breeds may be more prone to allergies, they can occur in all cats. Early intervention is critical to long-term success. As soon as you notice your cat may be suffering from allergies, call your veterinarian for an exam.

Types of Allergies in Cats

The term “allergy” is a general label. Veterinarians recognize these six major types of allergies in cats:


	
	Food allergy
	
	
	Atopic dermatitis, or environmental allergies
	
	
	Flea allergy dermatitis
	
	
	Allergic contact dermatitis
	
	
	Cutaneous drug eruptions
	
	
	Allergic bronchitis, or feline asthma

Symptoms of Allergies in Cats
All types of allergies can cause similar, overlapping clinical signs in cats. These symptoms vary in intensity and may develop over years.

Food Allergy

Food allergies can look very similar to environmental allergies. Not all cats with a food allergy will have gastrointestinal signs like vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, and hypersalivation. Many will have skin symptoms, including itchiness, especially around the face, head, and neck. Food allergies are typically non-seasonal, meaning they occur all year round.

Atopic Dermatitis

Atopy, or environmental allergies, can mimic food allergies. Itchiness is the most reported clinical sign, in addition to ear infections, hair loss, skin plaques, and pustules. Often, cats have relapsing secondary bacterial and yeast infections. Atopy can also cause asthma-like respiratory issues, and conjunctivitis.

Flea Allergy Dermatitis

Flea allergies only affect the skin. Historically, cats with flea allergies either have poor or no flea control.   The head and neck are most often affected, as well as the inner thighs and abdomen. Often, cats have intense itching resulting in self-induced trauma from itching, chewing, and rubbing to relieve the itch.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Allergic contact dermatitis occurs as lesions on the skin after exposure to a certain trigger such as pollen, yeast, or mites. The location is determined by direct contact. Most cats with contact dermatitis show redness, swelling, pustules, and crusts at the site of exposure. Itching at these locations may be moderate or severe.

Cutaneous Drug Eruptions

Cutaneous drug eruptions are allergic reactions to any type of drug. They vary in clinical signs, location, and severity. Cats most often experience itchiness, rashes, redness, swelling, inflammation, hives, and in severe cases, cellular death and sloughing of the skin in sheets. This type of allergy is uncommon in cats.

Allergic Bronchitis

Allergic bronchitis is also known as asthma. Cats will typically wheeze, cough, and have labored breathing.

Causes of Allergies in Cats
Food Allergy 

The cause of food allergies in cats is poorly understood. Any protein, carbohydrate, preservative, additive, or dye can be potentially allergenic. Typically, a cat’s immune system is overstimulated by a protein. The most frequently reported allergies are beef, fish, and chicken. While cats can have allergies to grains, corn, or gluten, it is far less common than the main protein sources. Some studies indicate Siamese cats and cats under six months may have higher rates of developing food allergies.

Atopic Dermatitis

Atopy, or environmental allergies, is characterized by inflamed, itchy skin disease. Genetic causes are not well documented in cats, but atopy occurs more often in Abyssinian, Devon Rex, and domestic short-haired cats less than 3 years old. The most common causes of atopy are:


	
	Pollen
	
	
	Mold spores
	
	
	Yeast
	
	
	Dust and storage mites
	
	
	Animal or human dander
	


Flea Allergic Dermatitis

Flea allergic dermatitis occurs as a hypersensitive reaction to the flea’s saliva.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Allergic contact dermatitis is rare in cats and involves a delayed hypersensitive reaction at the site of contact with:


	
	Plants (pollen, grasses, trees)
	
	
	Medications (topical drugs, ear medications, soaps, shampoos, insecticides)
	
	
	Home furnishings (fibers, dyes, polishes, cleansers)
	
	
	Other (rice flour, chlorinated water)
	


Cutaneous Drug Eruptions

Any drug can cause a cutaneous drug reaction. It can happen after one dose or multiple doses. More common drugs that cause a drug eruption include antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, NSAIDs, and antiarrhythmic drugs.

Allergic Bronchitis

Asthma occurs when a cat’s immune system overreacts to allergen in the air causing airway inflammation and constriction of the airway. Cigarette smoke, poor environmental hygiene, dusty cat litter, hair spray, molds, pollen, powders, household chemicals, and air fresheners are all potential inciting allergens.

How Veterinarians Test for Allergies in Cats
Food Allergy

In cats with a suspected food allergy, a dietary elimination trial is the main diagnostic method. While you can purchase saliva test kits online or submit blood work to test for food allergies, there is currently no reliable data to suggest these tests are accurate.

A diet trial is typically done in one of two ways:

Novel protein diets remove the inciting allergen (beef, chicken, or fish) and instead offer the cat a new, or novel, protein that their immune system has never seen and, therefore, likely will not have a reaction to. Common novel proteins include whitefish, salmon, turkey, kangaroo, rabbit, duck, and venison.

Hydrolyzed protein diets contain ingredients that have been broken down into the smallest possible molecular weight so that they do not elicit an immune response.

Diet trials may take two to three months before there is a clinical improvement. They can be frustrating and difficult to interpret because of concurrent other types of allergies and compliance. During the diet trial, the cat cannot have any other food, treats or human food without affecting the outcome.

Atopic Dermatitis

Veterinarians use two main tests to diagnose specific environmental allergens:

A serology allergy test measures allergen-specific reactions in the blood. This is a simple test that most general practitioners can readily perform.

Intradermal testing is the gold-standard diagnostic test performed by veterinary dermatologists. Test allergens are injected into the skin and will form a wheal, or swelling, if the cat is sensitive to that antigen. This typically requires sedation.

Flea Allergy

Finding fleas and flea dirt can help diagnose a flea allergy but is not required. A flea comb is useful to identify fleas.

Blood tests (the same used for atopic dermatitis) can be used to help diagnose an allergy to fleas. Many veterinarians will treat for a flea allergy based on clinical exam and history alone. Response to treatment with appropriate flea prevention often provides the diagnosis on its own.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Finding the cause of allergic contact dermatitis is true detective work, taking significant time and investment from the pet parents. To test for allergic contact dermatitis, veterinarians perform a patch test. Materials from the house or outdoor area are applied to areas on the body and checked daily for 7 to 14 days. Biopsies are also useful in cases of suspected contact dermatitis.

Cutaneous Drug Eruption

Drug reactions are typically diagnosed with a history of drug administration right before the cat became sick and recovery occurring when the drug was discontinued. Any drug can cause a skin reaction, but some have a higher prevalence and may raise a veterinarian to be suspicious.

Allergic Bronchitis

Asthma is most often diagnosed on radiographs, or X-rays. Veterinarians will likely also perform blood work to determine overall health and may perform cultures to rule out other diagnoses.

Treatment for Allergies in Cats
Food Allergy

Most food allergies are treated by eliminating the offending food from your cat’s diet.

During flare-ups, treatment is supportive and based on the clinical signs present. Steroids, antibiotics, anti-diarrheal, antihistamines, and anti-nausea medication may all be used for acute cases.

Atopic Dermatitis

Immunotherapy, or allergy vaccine, is the preferred method to treat atopy. These vaccines can be given as an injectable, or under the tongue. The formulations are specifically made based on the test results and individual allergens but can take from three months to one year for full effect.

Immunosuppressive drugs, like cyclosporine may bring allergy symptoms under control faster than immunotherapy, usually within a month. However, this medication requires more blood work monitoring due to its ability to suppress the immune system.

During severe episodes, cats may require supportive care based on their clinical signs. Medications may include:


	
	Steroids
	
	
	Antibiotics and antifungals for secondary infections
	
	
	Pain medications
	
	
	Topical therapy
	
	
	Antihistamines
	


Flea Allergy

Cats with a suspected or confirmed flea allergy should receive flea control treatment. It is important to use only those products made specifically for cats. Most products come in a topical liquid or collar. Based on the flea’s lifecycle, these cats must be treated for at least 3 consecutive months in addition to environmental decontamination.

Supportive therapy may be required in the early phases. Cats frequently have secondary infections and may need antibiotics, steroids, anti-inflammatories, or topical therapy.

Allergic Contact Dermatitis

Once identified, the offending substance should be removed as a primary method of treatment. Hypoallergenic shampoos and wipes may help remove the offending allergen, but (as pet parents know) not all cats are happy with this treatment.

Other treatments include topical therapy, steroids, immunosuppressive and immunomodulating drugs.

Cutaneous Drug Eruptions

Most cutaneous drug eruptions are treated by stopping the offending drug. Some cases may require supportive care, hospitalization, and pain management. Severe reactions may require immunosuppressive therapy.

Allergic Bronchitis

Treatment for asthma is based on severity of clinical signs. For some cats, simply removing the allergen will improve symptoms. Unfortunately, determining the cause is often difficult, which means daily medication with steroids, bronchodilators, and immunotherapy may be required. Cats in respiratory distress require hospitalization and oxygen supplementation.

Difficulty breathing is a medical emergency. If your cat is breathing with its mouth open or has labored breathing, seek veterinary care immediately.

Recovery and Management for Allergies in Cats
With time, the commitment of loving pet parents, and a close relationship with a veterinarian, allergies can be managed, and your cat can enjoy a good quality of life. Allergies cannot typically be cured, but with monitoring and early intervention if flare-ups do occur, cats can quickly return to normal.

Risk factors, especially with cats with atopy, include environments with long allergy seasons and high pollen levels. Cats with multiple types of allergies are more difficult to diagnose, treat, and manage.

In addition, some allergies like flea allergies and contact dermatitis, become more severe and chronic as cats age. Work with your vet to determine the best treatments to manage your cat’s allergies, given the specific diagnosis and its personality.

667,Adverse Reaction in Cats to Glow Jewelry,"Dibutyl Phthalate Ingestion in Cats

Glow jewelry, which is available in the form of glow sticks, glow bracelets, glow necklaces and more, contain a chemical that glows in the dark and are particularly popular around the July 4 holiday and Halloween. However, when chewed or ingested by your cat, the chemical inside of the sticks and/or jewelry cause an intense reaction to the taste of the chemical.

This adverse reaction associated with glow jewelry can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

When cats bite into or ingest glow jewelry or glow sticks, the chemical dibutyl phthalate causes an intense taste reaction. Symptoms seen include:


    Drooling
    Pawing at the mouth
    Agitation/irritation
    Vomiting (rare)


Other than the reaction to the bad taste, glow sticks and glow jewelry are generally not toxic.

Causes

It is the chemical found in glow sticks and other glow jewelry named dibutyl phthalate which may cause adverse reactions in cats and that cats find offensive.

Diagnosis

In addition to taking the cat's medical history, a veterinarian will observe your cat for signs and symptoms associated with ingesting dibutyl phthalate.
 
 

Treatment

Generally, no treatment is needed for cats that ingest glow jewelry. However, providing water or food to diminish the taste of the glow stick/jewelry can be useful in alleviating symptoms. Washing the chemical off of your cat’s fur and skin with shampoo and water is also recommended. Taking your pet into a darkened room can help you locate the chemical on your cat’s fur and skin to aid in removal.

Prevention

The best way to prevent accidental ingestion is to keep glow sticks and glow jewelry out of your cat's reach."," and Types

"
668,Adrenal Gland Cancer (Pheochromocytoma) in Cats,"Pheochromocytoma in Cats

A pheochromocytoma is a type of adrenal gland tumor which causes the gland to make too much of some of the hormones. This can cause an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. These symptoms are intermittent (not present all of the time) because the hormones that cause them are not made all of the time or are made in low amounts.

Pheochromocytomas are rare in cats.  When they do occur it is usually with older cats.  Because this tumor affects an endocrine gland that functions to spread hormones, pheochromocytomas commonly spread to organs that are near them and can rapidly metastasize to other areas of the body.

Symptoms and Types


    Weakness
    Shaking
    Collapse
    Lack of appetite (anorexia)
    Lack of energy (lethargy)
    Lack of interest in usual activities (depression)
    Vomiting
    Panting
    Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
    Increased urination (polyuria)
    Increased thirst (polydipsia)
    Diarrhea
    Weight loss
    Pacing
    Seizures
    Bloated abdomen
    Symptoms may seem to come and go
    Occasionally no symptoms will be present


Causes

Pheochromocytoma is labeled idiopathic, since there is no known cause for this condition.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will need a thorough medical history and time-line of your cat's behavior, health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will palpate your cat's belly to see if a mass can be felt or if there is extra fluid is present. A rapid heart rate (tachycardia) is sometimes found during the physical examination, but sometimes, there will not be anything that appears to be abnormal during the examination. Standard blood work, including a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis will be ordered. These will indicate how well your cat's internal organs are working and whether there are any infections present. Your veterinarian may also order a special blood test which will indicate whether the adrenal gland is functioning normally.  Your cat's blood pressure will be taken, and in some cases, the blood pressure will be very high, indicating hypertension.



If your cat's heart rate is very high, or its heart seems to have an abnormal rhythm, your veterinarian may order an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical capability of the heart. Your veterinarian will also order x-rays and/or ultrasound images of your cat's abdomen and thorax (chest). If there are abnormalities of the internal organs, they may show up on an x-ray or ultrasound image. Further diagnostic tests may include a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance image (MRI). These imaging tools are higher sensitivity tests, which can give a more detailed picture of your cat's internal organs. To confirm a final diagnosis, your veterinarian will need to take a biopsy of the adrenal gland for laboratory analysis.

It is common for cats with a pheochromocytoma to have more than one medical problem, and treatment will  be approached according to which condition is most critical.

Treatment

Surgery is the chosen treatment for a pheochromocytoma. If your cat has high blood pressure or a very high heart rate, these conditions will be treated with medication and stabilized before surgery can be performed. If the blood pressure or heart rate are dangerously high, your cat may need to be in intensive care before surgery can be performed. Some cats need to be placed on medication to control blood pressure and heart rate for several weeks before surgery can be performed.

During surgery, the affected adrenal gland will be removed. Because the adrenal gland is near some very large blood vessels, surgery can be challenging. If, during surgery, it is found that other organs are being affected by the tumor, they will need to be removed as well, either in part or in their entirety, depending on the organ. After surgery, your cat will be kept in the hospital intensive care unit until it is stable. Problems during and after surgery are common. Your veterinarian will monitor for bleeding, high or low blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, difficulty breathing, or post-operative infections. Unfortunately, some cats do not make it through recovery because of these problems, especially if they have other medical problems. Your veterinarian will help you to decide the best course of action based on the diagnosis and expectations for recovery.

Living and Management

Once your cat's tumor has been removed and it is able to return home with you, it will take a little time for your cat to return to a normal life with normal activity. Your cat's life expectancy will be based  on whether there are other health conditions concurrent with the  pheochromocytoma. Some cats will continue to live for three or more years, while others have shorter expectancies."," and Types

669,Adhesions of the Eye’s Iris and Swelling of Eye in Cats,"Iris Bombe - Complete Posterior Synechiae in Cat

Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye, either the cornea or lens. Iris bombe occurs when there is a complete adhesion between the cat’s iris and the capsule of the lens of the eye, creating a 360 degree area of adhesion. This degree of adhesion results in a billowing of the iris forward into the eye.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms seen with iris bombe include:


    Eye bulging
    Eye pain
    Red eyes
    Squinting
    Corneal lesions, such      as ulcers
    Excessive tearing and      discharge
    Glaucoma
    Variation in the color      of the iris
    Opacity of the lens
    Uveitis
    Decreased papillary      reaction to light


Causes


    Cat fight injury
    Chronic infection
    Corneal ulcer
    Foreign body injury to      the eye
    Hyphema (bleeding in      the front part of the eye)
    Penetrating wounds to      the eye
    Surgery


Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball).



Treatment

In many cases, treatment may not be necessary. However, when glaucoma occurs in conjunction with iris bombe and synechiae, it must be treated. In cases like this, laser surgery may be necessary to release the adhesions from the iris."," and Types

Addison’s disease (also called hypoadrenocorticism) affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as cortisol that are vital to the healthy function of many of the body’s systems. A lack of these hormones can have devastating effects on a cat’s health.

In cats, the adrenal glands are found in front of the kidneys, and the hormones produced help control:


	
	Electrolytes: Aldosterone is one of the hormones involved with balancing electrolytes, which affect hydration.
	
	
	Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol): These hormones affect numerous functions such as the immune system, regulating glucose, fat, and protein metabolism.
	
	
	Sexual function: The adrenals are responsible for producing sex hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, and androgens.
	


Addison’s disease is very rare in cats. Although rare, Addison’s should be considered a medical emergency because the disease impacts so many vital systems.

Symptoms are sporadic and can often include vomiting or gastrointestinal upset that may be brought on or worsened by stress or another illness. Most cats experience some of the following symptoms:


	
	Decreased appetite and/or weight loss
	
	
	Malaise and weakness
	
	
	Dehydration, with increased thirst and urination
	
	
	Slow capillary refill time, in which a veterinarian presses on gums and counts the seconds until the area refills with blood
	
	
	Low blood pressure and/or heart rate
	
	
	Vomiting
	
	
	Hypothermia
	


Diarrhea may also occur, though not as frequently as other symptoms. Other signs include those related to shock, such as cooler than normal limbs or paws; pale or discolored gums; shallow or rapid breathing; or rapid or absent pulses.
Causes of Addison’s Disease in Cats
Addison’s disease, while rare, does not seem to be associated with any breed or particular age. Although the cause is unknown, it may be due to an autoimmune condition in which a cat’s immune system attacks and destroys the adrenal glands.

In addition, Addison’s has been associated with lymphoma or the sudden withdrawal of steroid therapy.
How Veterinarians Diagnose Addison’s Disease in Cats
Addison’s disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and a history of symptoms associated with the disease. Blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count (CBC), check for:


	
	Anemia (low red blood cell count)
	
	
	Changes in a cat’s white blood cell pattern
	
	
	Increase in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell
	


Other tests will look for an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and phosphorus. A vet will look for electrolyte imbalance (such as high potassium or low sodium, which can affect the heart’s rhythm). 

ACTH Test for Cats

If a vet suspects Addison’s, a test called ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) will be ordered. This test evaluates adrenal function and mimics what is naturally (or should be) occurring in the cat. 

ACTH hormone is produced by the pituitary gland, which acts on the adrenals to produce the hormone cortisol.  In the hospital, a blood sample is taken from the cat to measure the baseline cortisol.  Then a synthetic ACTH is administered, and another blood sample is taken from the cat an hour later and compared with the first. In cases of Addison’s, there will be minimal to no increase of cortisol. 

Additional tests that may be recommended include:


	
	Urinalysis to look for evidence of kidney disease and concentration of the urine
	
	
	Blood pressure to diagnose hypotension and response to IV fluid therapy
	
	
	Chest X-rays to look for heart issues (microcardia)
	
	
	ECG to determine the presence of arrhythmias and evidence of electrolyte issues
	

Treatment of Addison’s Disease in Cats
Although there is no cure, Addison’s disease is manageable and cats can enjoy long, active and happy lives.

If symptoms are severe, initial treatment will focus on stabilizing the cat. Dehydration, hypovolemia, anemia, vomiting, or electrolyte derangements often require aggressive fluid therapy, and possibly blood transfusions. If required, various medications will be given. Several days of hospitalization may be needed. 

Addison’s disease occurs due to a lack of steroids, so the treatment of choice is steroid replacement therapy, often with prednisolone or depo-medrol. This can be given as a pill, liquid, or monthly injection. Therapy may be coupled with a synthetic mineralocorticoid (desoxycorticosterone pivalate, or DOCP), an injectable given about once every month, or fludrocortisone acetate, an oral medication given daily, are the treatments of choice. 
Recovery and Management of Addison’s Disease in Cats
Once your cat is discharged, your veterinarian may recommend a follow-up exam with bloodwork in a few weeks after starting these medications. The dose and frequency of both medications will be influenced by the results, and it may take several follow-up visits before the dose is correct and working properly.

Once stable and well-managed, your cat may still need to have her electrolytes checked prior to every DOCP injection and they should continue to be examined frequently, about once every 3 to 6 months, or as directed by your veterinarian. Dosing can change over time due to the disease.

Many of the symptoms initially experienced take several days to resolve and if initial treatment is successful, the long-term prognosis is good. Be sure to adhere to your veterinarian’s recheck and follow-up guidelines and remember that your cat requires lifelong medication!

And because cortisol is needed to adapt to stressful situations, in Addisonian cats, even small stressors could have serious consequences.  It’s recommended that during periods of increased stress and illness you speak with your veterinarian about the need to increase the dose of your cat’s medication.

672,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in Cats,"Shock Lung in Cats



Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) involves severe inflammation of the lungs which ultimately leads to acute respiratory failure and death in affected cats. This is a life-threatening problem, causing death in a majority of patients despite life saving efforts and treatment. An almost 100 percent death rate is reported in affected cats due to ARDS. Genetic factors have been found to play a role in the development of acute respiratory failure in people, but these factors have not yet been investigated in cats.



Symptoms and Types



Acute respiratory distress syndrome can present with a number of conditions and symptoms, which vary depending upon the underlying cause. Following are general symptoms seen in ARDS:




	Extreme efforts to breath
	Cough
	Discharge from nostrils in some patients
	Fever
	Cyanosis (blue discoloration of skin)
	Other signs related to the specific underlying disease




Causes



Following are some of the major causes of ARDS in cats:




	Pneumonia
	Smoke and noxious gases inhalation
	Near drowning
	Thermal burns
	Aspiration of gastric contents
	Serious infections
	Lung injury due to trauma
	Other serious illness




Diagnosis



Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a life threatening emergency that requires immediate treatment for any chance of recovery. Along with emergency treatment, your veterinarian will try to find the underlying cause of the disorder. Various laboratory test panels will be ordered, including blood tests, serum biochemical tests, urine tests and blood gases. Blood gas analysis is one of the most important diagnostic methods used in veterinary practice for ARDS. Your veterinarian will also order chest X-rays and an echocardiography to evaluate the lungs and heart.









Treatment



Despite recent advances, ARDS remains one of the most difficult and challenging problems to treat in veterinary practice.



Once your cat has been diagnosed with this syndrome it will be given emergency treatment; supplemental oxygen therapy is started immediately to minimize the respiratory distress. Patients that do not respond well to the oxygen therapy, and that continue to have severe breathing problems, may need ventilator support. For this reason, your cat will most likely need to be kept in an intensive care unit, where nursing staff can monitor the condition very closely until your cat is out of the danger zone and its condition has stabilized. Regular readings of temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure will be taken by nursing staff. Along with emergency treatment, the underlying cause muse be established and treated in order to prevent further complications.



Medications that may be used to treat your cat include antibiotics, pain killers, fluid therapy, and corticosteroids. Patients on ventilator support may also require regular physiotherapy sessions and frequent position changes to prevent complications related to ventilator support. These patients are kept in strict cage confinement until they have fully recovered.



Living and Management



ARDS is a very serious problem requiring constant support from your side for treatment, and for management and care after the initial period of discovery. If the underlying disease is not resolved, the same episode of respiratory distress may follow. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for proper care and treatment. These patients usually need time, rest, and good nutrition in order to gain full recovery, but don’t confine your cat to a stuffy or hot place. Follow the diet and management recommendations made by your veterinarian."," and Types

673,Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats,"What Are Acral Lick Granulomas?
Acral lick granulomas are skin lesions that appear more commonly in dogs but can occasionally be seen in cats, as well. This condition exists when your cat pet licks a specific area on its leg or paw. Allergies, anxiety, and other causes may be a trigger for this constant licking behavior.

Cats will lick the area so much that its fur will be removed and the skin will become thick, red, and moist. Acral lick granulomas (sometimes called acral lick dermatitis) are usually about the size of a dime or nickel but can be larger. They are found most often on a cat’s lower legs or between its toes.

Check your pet’s symptom
Symptoms of Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats 
If your cat has an acral lick granuloma, you may notice the following symptoms:


	
	Itchiness
	
	
	Excessive licking
	
	
	Hair loss
	
	
	Redness of the skin
	
	
	Thickened skin
	
	
	Scabbing
	
	
	Moist skin
	
	
	Odor (if secondary infection is present)
	


Causes of Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats
Acral lick granulomas are caused by an underlying condition or problem, such as allergies, anxiety, joint pain, skin infection, mites, trauma, boredom, foreign material under the skin, or an insect bite.

Regardless of the underlying cause, the constant licking behavior causes hair loss and the formation of a raised, ulcerated plaque on the skin that is referred to as a granuloma. It is classified as an acral lick granuloma because acral means legs and feet, which is where these lesions are found, and licking is the cause of the skin lesion. There are no cat breeds that are more prone to this skin condition than others.

How Veterinarians Diagnose Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats
An acral lick granuloma is diagnosed based on medical history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. It is helpful for a veterinarian to know if a cat is constantly licking a specific area of its body and when the licking behavior started. It is also important to note any changes in the environment where the cat lives, such as diet, moving into a new house, or the addition of a new baby or pet to the household.

After obtaining a thorough medical history, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam on your cat. The vet will look closely at your cat’s skin for fleas, other parasites, and signs of infection. The following diagnostic tests may be recommended to diagnose an acral lick granuloma and rule out other skin conditions:


	
	Tape impression: A piece of tape is gently placed over the skin lesion briefly and then removed. The tape is then stained and reviewed under the microscope to check for bacteria and yeast on the skin which would indicate a skin infection.
	
	
	Fungal culture: This test also checks for ringworm, which is a fungal infection that can cause a circular skin lesion where the fur is missing and the skin is inflamed. To perform a fungal culture, a veterinarian will pluck a sample of fur around the skin lesion and place it on a culture plate. Over 10 days, the culture plate will be examined daily to check for fungal growth.
	
	
	Fine needle aspirate and cytology: This test involves removing some cells from the skin lesion with a small needle to view under a microscope. Veterinarians recommend this test to determine if the skin lesion is due to a benign or cancerous mass.
	
	
	Skin biopsy: Occasionally a skin lesion needs to be biopsied to determine the cause of the lesion. This means obtaining a small section of skin that contains both healthy skin and the skin lesion. This is a minor surgical procedure that is performed with sedation. The biopsy sample is then sent to a pathologist for review.
	
	
	Skin scrapings: This test checks for skin mites, such as sarcoptic mange and demodex. The veterinarian will use a scalpel blade to gently scrape the skin. The material that is scraped off is examined under the microscope to look for the presence of skin mites.
	
	
	Skin culture: This test may be recommended to check for an antibiotic resistant skin infection. A sterile swab is rolled over the top of the skin lesion to obtain a sample of any bacteria that may be present. The swab is then placed in a culture medium to monitor bacterial growth over a three-day period. If bacteria growth is present, the type is identified and tested with a variety of antibiotics to determine which ones are best to treat the infection.
	
	
	Allergy testing: This test will determine if a cat has certain environmental allergies. Allergy testing usually involves a blood test, but intradermal testing (wheal and flare test) may also be recommended by a dermatologist to test for allergies to pollen, dust mites, mold, and insects in the environment.
	
	
	Food trial: A cat may need to go through a food trial to determine if a food allergy is the cause of its skin condition. A food trial takes approximately six-to-eight weeks and involves feeding a very strict limited ingredient diet consisting of prescription food that contains either novel protein or hydrolyzed protein. During this trial, it is crucial to not feed your pet any other cat food, cat treats (other than hypoallergenic), or people food. Only feed prescribed food and treats approved by your veterinarian.
	
	X-rays: A veterinarian may recommend X-rays of the limb that has the acral lick granuloma to screen for arthritis, trauma, and a possible foreign body under the skin that would cause pain and trigger a cat to lick the area more often.


Treatment of Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats
Treatment of an acral lick granuloma involves the following:


	
	Prevent licking: It is crucial that the cat stops licking at the acral lick granuloma. If licking continues, this skin lesion will never resolve. The best way to prevent licking is for the cat to wear an e-collar (cone) until the acral lick granuloma is gone. You can also try Yuck! No Chew Spray, a topical product that can be sprayed on the skin lesion. The bitter taste of this product is meant to discourage licking of the area. However, some cats will continue to lick the area even with the Yuck spray applied. The use of an e-collar is the most effective method of stopping a cat from licking a skin lesion.
	
	
	Treat any secondary infection: If there is a bacterial or yeast infection on the surface of the granuloma secondary to licking, then this infection must be treated with oral and/or topical medication prescribed by a veterinarian.
	
	
	Cold laser therapy: This therapy can be performed two-to-three times weekly by a veterinarian or veterinary assistant to reduce inflammation (swelling) at the site of the acral lick granuloma.
	
	
	Address underlying cause for acral lick granuloma: There are many possible causes for acral lick granulomas, and if the cause can be identified and treated, this will help the skin lesion resolve and hopefully prevent recurrence. Treatment will vary based on the underlying cause.

	
		
		For instance, if boredom or anxiety are the cause for the formation of an acral lick granuloma, then behavioral modification is needed, which may involve more human interaction, toys, exercise, medication, or removing environmental stressors (if possible). If arthritis is found to be the underlying cause of an acral lick granuloma, a veterinarian may recommend a weight loss plan, joint supplement, or medication to address the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis.
		
	
	
	Surgery: A veterinarian may recommend surgical removal of the acral lick granuloma, but this is often a last resort when other treatment options have failed. If no underlying cause is found and treated, it is possible that after surgery the cat may start licking the area again and form another acral lick granuloma.


Recovery and Management of Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats
Acral lick granulomas can take weeks or months to resolve. Healing will be delayed if a cat licks at the acral lick granuloma. It is crucial to prevent licking, treat any secondary infection, and address the underlying cause for the granuloma, if found.

During recovery, it is important to watch the acral lick granuloma to make sure that the skin lesion is improving daily. If it increases in size, becomes increasingly red or swollen (or has an odor), then these symptoms need to be reported to your veterinarian.

Applying a bandage over the granuloma is not recommended as this will trap moisture close to the skin and cause the acral lick granuloma to become even more inflamed and possibly infected.

Prevention of Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats

If you notice that your cat is licking an area excessively, place an e-collar (cone) that has been properly fitted over your cat’s head to prevent licking and check the area where your cat is licking to see if there is a wound, crusts, hair loss, redness, swelling, or odor. Schedule an appointment with your local veterinarian as soon as possible so your pet can be examined. It is best to schedule an appointment for your cat within a few days of noticing the excessive licking instead of waiting weeks.

674,Acid Reflux in Cats,"Gastroesophageal Reflux in Cats



The uncontrollable reverse flow of gastric or intestinal fluids into the tube connecting the throat and the stomach (esophagus) is medically referred to as gastroesophageal reflux. This may be due to a brief relaxation of the muscular opening at the base of the esophagus (referred to as the sphincter), as well as chronic vomiting. Gastroesophageal reflux is fairly common in cats, and may occur at any age, although younger cats are at greater risk.



Gastric stomach acids, pepsin, bile salts, and other components of the gastrointestinal juices cause damage to the protective mucus lining the esophagus. This can result in inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis).



Symptoms and Types



Gastroesophageal reflux can cause esophagitis with varying amounts of damage. Mild esophagitis is limited to a mild inflammation of the esophageal lining, while more severe ulcerative esophagitis causes damage to the deeper layers of the esophagus.



Your cat's behavioral history can reveal symptoms such as spitting up (regurgitation) of food, evidence of pain (mewling or howling, for example) while swallowing, lack of appetite, and weight loss. A physical exam will often not reveal any concrete findings. Severe esophagitis may include symptoms of fever and extreme salivation.



Causes



Gastroesophageal reflux may occur when an anesthetic is administered, causing the opening between the stomach and the esophagus (gastroesophageal sphincter) to relax. Improper positioning of the patient during anesthesia, as well as a failure to fast the animal properly prior to anesthesia can also result in gastroesophageal reflux.



An associated condition is congenital hiatal hernia, which is suspected of heightening the risk for gastroesophageal reflux. Young cats are at greater risk of developing this condition as well because their gastroesophageal sphincters are still developing. Long-term or chronic vomiting is another risk factor.



Diagnosis



The best means of diagnosis is generally an esophagoscopy, an examination which uses an internal camera to view the lining of the esophagus. This is the most effective way to determine if changes in the mucus of the esophagus are consistent with esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux. The examination may also reveal an irregular surface in the mucus lining, or active bleeding in the esophagus.



Alternative diagnoses include ingestion of a caustic agent, a foreign body or tumor in the esophagus, a hernia in the upper portion of the stomach (hiatal hernia), or disease of the throat or mouth.







Treatment



Most treatment will be done at home. Your veterinarian may advise you to withhold food for one to two days, thereafter following a dietary regimen of low-fat, low-protein meals given in small, frequent feedings. Dietary fat and protein should be limited, as fat decreases the strength of the muscle between the stomach and esophagus, while protein stimulates the secretion of gastric acid.



Medications are an additional option. Drugs known as gastrointestinal pro-kinetic agents improve the movement of stomach contents through the intestines and also strengthen the gastroesophageal sphincter. Regardless of whether medications are given, a change in diet is advisable.



Do NOT provide your cat Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). It is considered unsafe for use in cats due to a cat's sensitivity to salicylates.



Living and Management



After initial treatment and alteration of diet, it is advisable to continue monitoring for gastroesophageal reflux. Watch for signs of discomfort. A continued low-fat, low-protein diet will prevent future incidences, and high-fat foods should be avoided, as they may worsen gastroesophageal reflux.



If your cat does not respond to initial medical treatments, a follow-up esophagoscopy may be advised.



Prevention



High-fat foods can worsen acid reflux. The best prevention is a healthy diet that is low in fatty foods."," and Types



Gastroesophageal reflux can cause esophagitis with varying amounts of damage. Mild esophagitis is limited to a mild inflammation of the esophageal lining, while more severe ulcerative esophagitis causes damage to the deeper layers of the esophagus.

675,Accumulation of Air Between Chest and Lungs in Cats,"Pneumothorax in Cats

Pneumothorax is the medical term for an accumulation of air in the area between the cat's chest wall and lungs (the pleural space). It may be categorized as traumatic or spontaneous, and closed or open.

Both dogs and cats are susceptible to pneumothorax. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

Traumatic pneumothorax, which occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and is due to some sort of trauma, such as a car accident, may be evident by the signs of shock.

Cats with spontaneous pneumothorax, on the other hand, may show sings of lung disease. Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease).

Open pneumothorax occurs when there is a defect located in the respiratory system, such as a puncture in the chest wall, resulting in contact between the pleural space and the outside atmosphere; closed pneumothorax, meanwhile, is identified as pneumothorax without any respiratory defects.

Traumatic pneumothorax is generally open, while spontaneous pneumothorax is always closed.

Another type of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, in which air is transferred into the pleural space during regular inhalation, becoming trapped, and creating a one-way transfer of air into the pleural space.

Causes

Causes vary depending on the type of pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax may be due to a traumatic incident, such as a car accident, leading to penetrating injuries of the neck or chest. A surgical incision to the chest, or perforation of the esophagus during surgery may also lead to traumatic pneumothorax.

Spontaneous pneumothorax, meanwhile, may be caused by a foreign body in the lung, lung cancer or abscess, lung disease caused by parasites, or the development of blister-like structures in the cat's lungs, known as pulmonary bullae.

Diagnosis

Two primary diagnostic procedures may be done in cases of suspected pneumothorax: thoracocentesis and bronchoscopy. Thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity, can confirm diagnosis, and can also be used to remove air from the pleural space. Bronchoscopy involves the use of a thin tube with a tiny camera attached to it, inserted into the airways by way of the mouth. This is best done if there is evidence of tracheal or large airway trauma.

Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging of the chest, and urine analysis.



Treatment

Cats with pneumothorax should be treated in the hospital until the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity has stopped or stabilized. As much air as possible should be removed from the pleural space, and oxygen therapy provided until your pet has stabilized. Air removal can be performed via thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity.

In cases of traumatic open pneumothorax, the open wounds in the cat's chest should be cleaned and covered with an airtight bandage as soon as possible, and later surgically repaired. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids is also often necessary in cases of trauma.

Living and Management

After initial treatment, the cat's activity should be severely restricted for at least one week to minimize the odds of recurrence. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse, should be monitored for symptoms of recurrence.

Further care depends on the type of pneumothorax affecting your cat and the severity of its health. Your veterinarian will advise you on how to provide aftercare to your cat until the follow-up exam.

Prevention

One key way to prevent traumatic pneumothorax is to keep cats confined and away from dangerous areas such as roads, where they are most likely to be injured."," and Types

There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

676,Abnormal Urine Outflow Due to Urinary Bladder Dysfunction in Cats,"Vesicourachal Diverticula in Cats
 
Vesicourachal diverticula occurs when a fetus' urachus -- embryological canal or tube connecting the placenta with urinary bladder of fetus -- fails to close. This congenital condition impairs the animal's normal urine outflow and makes it susceptible to urinary tract infections. Moreover, the condition may persist indefinitely if not treated properly.
 
Symptoms and Types
 

    Blood in urine (hematuria)
    Painful urination (dysuria)
    Increased frequency of urination (pollakiuria)

 
Causes
 
Often, vesicouracahal deiverticula occurs in the womb or during the birthing process. However, there is also an acquired form of the condition, which results from diseases that put undue pressure on the bladder (e.g., bacterial urinary tract infections, uroliths, and urethral plugs).
 
The acquired form is more common in cats with lower urinary tract disease; male cats are also at higher risk for vesicouracahal deiverticula than females.
 
Diagnosis
 
You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which help identify the underlying cause of the condition and the present of concurrent disorders.
 
The best tool for confirming diagnosis, however, is X-rays of the urethra and bladder while using contrast medium.
 


Treatment
 
The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of vesicourachal diverticula. Cats that do not respond to conventional treatment may require surgery to correct the defect.
 
Living and Management
 
You will need to visit the veterinarian for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will take urine samples to evaluate the status of infection. Some animals will require long-term antibiotic therapy to combat urinary tract infections. However, overall prognosis in cats with vesicourachal diverticula is good after treatment."," and Types

677,Abnormal Protein Production in Cats,"Paraproteinemia in Cats

Gamma globulins, or immunoglobulins, are part of the body's antibody response to fighting infections. They are a class of blood protein produced by plasma cell, a type of white blood cell; their purpose: to identify and neutralize invading bacteria and viruses.

In paraproteinemia, abnormal paraproteins (proteins in the blood or urine) or M components are produced by a single clone of plasma cells. Such production of abnormal proteins is commonly seen in plasma cell tumors and in some other types of tumors, as well as in plasma cell myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells. It is rare in cats, but when it does occur, it is usually in older cats.

Symptoms and Types


    Generalized weakness
    Lethargy
    Lameness
    Nose bleeds
    Blindness
    Increased thirst and urination
    Seizures
    Memory loss


Causes


    Cancers
    Genetic predisposition
    Viral Infections
    Exposure to carcinogens (e.g., 	paints or solvents)


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as infections, or contact with carcinogenic substances. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination, including routine laboratory testing. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood testing may reveal anemia, abnormally low levels of leukocytes or white blood cells (leukopenia), or abnormally low levels of platelets (thrombocytopenia).



A biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of proteins in the blood, low levels of albumin (a type of protein), abnormally high levels of calcium (hypercalcemia), and high levels of urea and creatinine in the blood. The urinalysis may show the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria). More specific testing will also be conducted to diagnose various diseases.

Thoracic and abdominal X-rays will be taken to identify where lymphoma (cancer) is present. A sample of bone marrow may be taken, which will reveal more details associated with this disease. Similarly, samples from affected lymph nodes will also be taken to identify the type of cancer cells or infectious agents that are attacking the body.

Treatment

If your cat is diagnosed with paraproteinemia and associated cancer, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any other remedies recommended by your veterinary oncologist. Antibiotic therapy may also be conducted to treat underlying bacterial infections, if present.

Living and Management

Follow your veterinarian's guidelines for chemotherapy medication at home, as these drugs are potentially toxic and should only be used under strict guidance from a veterinary oncologist."," and Types

678,Abnormal Passageway Between the Mouth and Nasal Cavity in Cats,"Oronasal Fistula in Cats

A fistula is characterized as an abnormal passageway between two openings, hollow organs, or cavities. They occur as a result of injury, infection, or disease. A communicating, vertical passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity is called an oronasal fistula. Oronasal fistulas are rare in cats, but they do occur.

These types of fistulas are caused by the diseased condition of any tooth in the upper jaw. The most common location for an oronasal fistula is where the root of the fourth premolar on the upper jaw enters the palate. This condition will need to be surgically corrected to prevent food and water from passing from the mouth into the nasal cavity. If this should occur, it will cause irritation of the nose, runny nose, inflammation of the sinuses, infection, and possibly pneumonia.

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Symptoms of an oronasal fistula include a chronically runny nose, with or without bleeding, and persistent sneezing.

Causes


    Trauma
    Bite wounds
    Oral cancer
    Electrical shock
    Periodontal disease
    Traumatic tooth extraction
    Mandibular canines (the fang-like teeth) positioned toward the tongue
    Upper jaw overbites, which causes the canine teeth in the bottom jaw to pierce the hard palate (roof of the mouth)


Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and oral exam using a periodontal probe to investigate the suspected oronasal fistula.
A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. The blood-work should be done before anesthetizing the cat for surgical correction of the oronasal fistula.

Treatment

Surgical removal of the tooth, and closure of the passageway is the treatment of choice. A skin flap will be placed in both the mouth and in the nasal cavity during closure.

Living and Management

Since a flap to repair an oronasal fistula undergoes constant tension each time the cat breathes, oronasal fistulae tend to reopen. Additional surgeries with advanced tissue flaps can be performed if this occurs."," and Types

Symptoms of an oronasal fistula include a chronically runny nose, with or without bleeding, and persistent sneezing.

"
679,Abnormal Passage Between Artery and Vein in Cats,"Arteriovenous Fistula in Cats

An abnormal, low resistance connection between an artery and a vein is called an arteriovenous fistula. If large enough, the fistula may cause a significant fraction of the total cardiac output to bypass the capillary bed, making it so that the tissues receive little or no oxygen. The heart, in turn, tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by pumping blood out to the body at a faster rate, which may lead “high output” congestive heart failure.

The location of arteriovenous fistulae varies; reported sites include the head, neck, ear, tongue, limbs, flank, spinal cord, cerebrum (part of the brain), lung, liver, vena cava (major vein leading back to the heart), and gastrointestinal tract.

Symptoms and Types

The symptoms associated with an arteriovenous fistula will ultimately depend on the size and location of the fistula. Typically, there is a warm, non-painful at the site of the fistula. If the lesion is on a limb, the cat may display:


    Swelling 	where you can touch the limb and a fingertip impression is left in 	the skin (pitting edema)
    Lameness
    Ulceration
    Scabbing
    Gangrene 	(Tissue dies and turns green)


Signs of congestive heart failure, which is often associated with this type of fistula, include:


    Coughing
    Difficulty 	breathing (dyspnea)
    Increased 	heart rate 	(tachypnea)
    Exercise 	intolerance


If the arteriovenous fistula causes organ failure, your cat may display:


    Distention 	of the abdomen (liver)
    Seizures 	(brain)
    Weakness 	or paralysis (spinal cord)


Causes

Cats are rarely born with arteriovenous fistulas. Typically, they acquire the fistula due to  traumatic damage to blood vessels, surgery complications, tumor(s), or problems arising from drawing blood or injections around the blood vessels (e.g., barbiturates)

Diagnosis

You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to help identify complications associated with an arteriovenous fistula. Biochemical abnormalities, for example, may suggest liver, kidney or other organ dysfunction.

Because arteriovenous fistulae significantly affect the cat's blood flow, thoracic x-rays may show enlargement of the heart and signs of over-circulation to the lungs. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound may show high-velocity, turbulent flow within the lesion.

To locate the arteriovenous fistula, your veterinarian may employ an echocardiogram on the cat. And to outline the lesion, which may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and is highly desirable for presurgical evaluation, the veterinarian may use selective angiography



Treatment

Cats with clinical signs must undergo surgery to divide and remove abnormal connections between blood vessels.  However, surgery can be difficult and labor-intensive and may require blood transfusions.  Also, though often successful, the arteriovenous fistula may recur even after surgery. Some cats may even require amputation of the affected appendage.

A newer treatment option called transcatheter embolization involves using a catheter to block blood vessels. This method is particularly advantageous because it is relatively noninvasive and provides access to remote lesions via the blood vessels.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate your cat, especially if it underwent surgery. This will also enable him or her to determine whether the arteriovenous fistula has recurred."," and Types

680,Abnormal Growths in the Lower Intestines of Cats,"Rectoanal Polyps in Cats

The growth of flap-like protrusions in the cat's anal and rectal walls is a condition referred to as rectoanal polyps. These polyps may be directly attached to the intestinal walls (sessile), or attached through a stalk-like cylindrical connection.

Most rectoanal polyps are non-cancerous, and are merely extensions of the innermost tissue lining of the intestinal walls. And while most cases of polyps are usually isolated, there are occasions cats suffer from multiple polyps.

The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how rectoanal polyps affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Cats suffering from rectoanal polyps will demonstrate straining or pain while passing stool. The stool may be stained with blood and/or covered with mucus.

Causes

The exact cause of rectoanal polyps is not clearly known. However, rectoanal polyps are rare in cats, and neither breed nor gender increases the likelihood for contracting this disorder.

Diagnosis

Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Some of the common tests include a complete blood count and a urinalysis, which will usually return as normal. Imaging tools, such as X-rays and ultrasounds, are not applicable to this particular diagnosis.

Some conditions that may produce symptoms similar to those caused by polyps include abscesses, tumors, inflammation, infection of the intestine, and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis, therefore, is usually made on the basis of a manual rectal examination of the cat by a veterinarian, or by direct visualization of the polyp through the external anal opening.

After a polyp is identified, a colonoscopy, using a tubular, flexible camera inserted through the anal opening, may be performed to check for the presence of other polyps. A detailed pathological study of the tissue, as well as the fluid from the polyp, may also be completed.

Treatment

Surgery is usually indicated for the effective management of polyps. The polyps may be removed through the anal opening, after which the anal opening will be closed with stitches. The same removal surgery may be performed endoscopically, or by using an electrical needle or probe. Some medications that may be prescribed are:


    Non-steroidal pain relievers
    Antibiotics (especially before surgery to prevent infection)
    Stool softeners


Possible complications include a relapse of the polyps and narrowing of the anal opening due to scarring and/or inflammation.

Living and Management

Your veterinarian will want to examine the surgical site after 14 days to make sure that the condition has been resolved and the tissue is healing properly. Another examination will be made at three months, and again at six months after surgery. Follow-up examinations will continue twice a year to check for recurrence. Fortunately, cats with single polyps usually do not relapse."," and Types

Cats suffering from rectoanal polyps will demonstrate straining or pain while passing stool. The stool may be stained with blood and/or covered with mucus.

681,Abnormal Diaphragm Opening in Cats,"Diaphragmatic Hernia in Cats

Diaphragmatic hernias occur when an abdominal organ (such as the stomach, liver, intestine, etc.) moves into an abnormal opening in the cat's diaphragm, the sheet of muscle separating the abdomen from the rib cage area. This can occur because of an acquired injury from a forceful blow, such as a car accident, or because of a defect at birth (congenital).

The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library.

Symptoms and Types

Signs of a diaphragmatic hernia include irregular heartbeat, labored breathing (especially after a forceful blow) and symptoms of shock. The abdomen may move rapidly (palpitate) or feel empty. Reactions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating can occur because of damage to the bowel or stomach.

In congenital cases, the symptoms may not be evident immediately. Gradual symptoms include muffled heart sounds or heart murmurs, abdominal defects, and trouble breathing. Signs may occur suddenly with damage to the bowel, spleen, or liver.

Causes

Most commonly, diaphragmatic hernia is caused by a trauma such as being hit by a car or other forceful blow. Therefore, diaphragmatic hernias occur most commonly with roaming outdoor cats. The pressure of such an impact causes a tear in the diaphragm, allowing an internal organ to protrude through the rip.

The reason for congenital diaphragmatic hernias is not known, although certain breeds are more likely to develop this abnormality. Some breeds may be predisposed, Himalayan cats in particular show higher numbers of congenital diaphragmatic hernias. Other birth defects may be evident in cats born with a diaphragmatic hernia, and the condition may cause further problems including rib fractures, organ failure, and impaired lung expansion.
  
Diagnosis

The most useful diagnostic test is through the use of X-rays (radiographs) to reveal inner abnormalities. If this is insufficient, further imaging processes like ultrasounds may be used.

Other symptoms that initially appear to be caused by a diaphragmatic hernia include a gathering of excess fluid in the space around the lungs or abnormally fast breathing due to other causes.


Treatment and Care

For trauma-induced diaphragmatic hernias, the patient must be treated for shock and it is imperative that breathing and heart rate are stabilized before going into surgery. Surgery should repair damaged organs, as well as the tear in the diaphragm. It is important that the patient be stable before surgery begins, as surgery will not necessarily improve any heart or breathing problems.

For congenital diaphragmatic hernias, surgery should be performed as soon as possible in order to avoid further damage to the animal’s internal organs. Again, it is important that breathing and heart rate are stabilized before operating. Drugs can be used to help stabilize heart rate.
 
Living and Management

After surgery is complete, there are secondary problems to look out for. Monitoring of heart rate with a monitor (electrocardiograph) is advised to check for irregular heartbeat.

Hyperthermia, or increased body temperature, is common in cats after surgery. Another common problem is swelling or fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema).

Most animals survive when surgery is successful and all secondary effects are controlled. Older cats with trauma-induced hernias are less likely to survive surgery.
 
Prevention

There is no method to prevent congenital diaphragmatic hernias, although it is best to operate as soon as possible. To avoid traumatic experiences that may cause diaphragmatic hernias, it is best to keep pets away from potentially dangerous areas, such as streets where car accidents are likely to occur."," and Types

Signs of a diaphragmatic hernia include irregular heartbeat, labored breathing (especially after a forceful blow) and symptoms of shock. The abdomen may move rapidly (palpitate) or feel empty. Reactions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating can occur because of damage to the bowel or stomach.
